<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-13 12:27:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Steroids (glucocorticosteroids) are widely used to treat inflammation. Bone loss (osteoporosis) and spinal fractures are serious side effects of this therapy. Bisphosphonates are considered a first-line treatment for osteoporosis and have been used since the 1990s.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the research published up to April 2016 and found a total of 27 eligible trials, which included 3075 adults with inflammatory diseases that required steroid treatment for at least one year. People were randomly assigned to receive either bisphosphonate treatment (alone or with calcium or vitamin D, or both) or 'no treatment' (given calcium or vitamin D or a placebo). Our objective was to determine the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for adults on long-term steroid therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Main Results</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>New spinal fractures (12 to 24 months)</I>
</P>
<P>There were 12 trials with 1343 people for this analysis. We found that 77 per 1000 people with no treatment experienced new spinal fracture compared to 44 per 1000 (range 27 to 70) people taking bisphosphonates; an absolute benefit of 2% fewer people (5% fewer to 1% more) sustaining spinal fractures when taking bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>Approximately 31 people (range 20 to 145) would need to be treated with bisphosphonates to prevent spinal fractures in one person.</P>
<P>
<I>New non-spinal fractures (12 to 24 months)</I>
</P>
<P>There were nine trials with 1245 people for this analysis. We found that 55 per 1000 people with no treatment experienced new non-spinal fractures compared to 42 per 1000 (range 25 to 69) people taking bisphosphonates; an absolute benefit of 1% fewer people (4% fewer to 1% more) sustaining non-spinal fractures when taking bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>
<I>Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months </I>
</P>
<P>There were 23 trials with 2042 people for this outcome. We found that the BMD of the lumbar spine of people taking bisphosphonates was 3.50% higher (2.90% to 4.10% higher) than in people who had no treatment.</P>
<P>Approximately three people (range 2 to 3) would need to be treated with bisphosphonates for 12 months for one person to see a minimally important difference in BMD at the lumbar spine.</P>
<P>
<I>Femoral neck (top of thigh bone) BMD at 12 months</I>
</P>
<P>There were 18 trials with 1665 people for this outcome. We found that the BMD of the femoral neck was 2.06% higher in the bisphosphonate group (1.45% to 2.68% more) than in people with no treatment.</P>
<P>Approximately five people (range 4 to 7) would need to be treated with bisphosphonates for 12 months for one person to see a minimally important difference in BMD at the femoral neck.</P>
<P>
<I>Serious adverse events (requiring hospitalisations, life threatening or fatal)</I>
</P>
<P>There were 15 trials with 1703 people for this outcome. We found that 162 per 1000 people with no treatment experienced serious adverse events compared to 147 per 1000 (range 120 to 181) taking bisphosphonates; an absolute increased harm of 0% more serious adverse events (2% fewer to 2% more) with bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>
<I>Withdrawals due to adverse events </I>
</P>
<P>There were 15 trials with 1790 people for this outcome. We found that 73 per 1000 people with no treatment withdrew compared to 77 per 1000 (range 56 to 107) people taking bisphosphonates; an absolute increased harm of 1% more withdrawals due to adverse events (1% fewer to 3% more) with bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Based on moderate- to high-certainty evidence, we found that bisphosphonates are beneficial in preventing new spinal fractures and preventing and treating steroid-induced bone loss at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. For preventing non-spinal fractures, we found that there was little or no difference whether patients used bisphosphonates or not, although this evidence was low-certainty because the methods used to assess non-spinal fractures were subject to bias.</P>
<P>We found that there was little or no difference in the number of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events when comparing bisphosphonates to no treatment. The evidence for these outcomes was of low certainty and we are cautious in making firm conclusions about the harm of bisphosphonates based only on these measures.</P>
<P>Overall, our review supports the use of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of spinal fractures and in the prevention and treatment of steroid-induced bone loss.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-07-14 05:50:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase up to April 2016 and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) via OVID up to January 2012 for relevant articles and conference proceedings with no language restrictions. We searched two clinical trial registries for ongoing and recently completed studies (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal). We also reviewed reference lists of relevant review articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-07-13 13:05:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) satisfying the following criteria: 1) prevention or treatment of GIOP; 2) adults taking a mean steroid dose of 5.0 mg/day or more; 3) active treatment including bisphosphonates of any type alone or in combination with calcium or vitamin D; 4) comparator treatment including a control of calcium or vitamin D, or both, alone or with placebo; and 4) reporting relevant outcomes. We excluded trials that included people with transplant-associated steroid use.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-15 05:31:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed &#8216;risk of bias&#8217; assessment and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Major outcomes of interest were the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures after 12 to 24 months; the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck after 12 months; serious adverse events; withdrawals due to adverse events; and quality of life. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 07:44:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included a total of 27 RCTs with 3075 participants in the review. Pooled analysis for incident vertebral fractures included 12 trials (1343 participants) with high-certainty evidence and low risk of bias. In this analysis 46/597 (or 77 per 1000) people experienced new vertebral fractures in the control group compared with 31/746 (or 44 per 1000; range 27 to 70) in the bisphosphonate group; relative improvement of 43% (9% to 65% better) with bisphosphonates; absolute increased benefit of 2% fewer people sustaining fractures with bisphosphonates (5% fewer to 1% more); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 31 (20 to 145) meaning that approximately 31 people would need to be treated with bisphosphonates to prevent new vertebral fractures in one person.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis for incident nonvertebral fractures included nine trials with 1245 participants with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and serious risk of bias as a patient-reported outcome). In this analysis 30/546 (or 55 per 1000) people experienced new nonvertebral fracture in the control group compared with 29/699 (or 42 per 1000; range 25 to 69) in the bisphosphonate group; relative improvement of 21% with bisphosphonates (33% worse to 53% better); absolute increased benefit of 1% fewer people with fractures with bisphosphonates (4% fewer to 1% more).</P>
<P>Pooled analysis on BMD change at the lumbar spine after 12 months included 23 trials with 2042 patients. Eighteen trials with 1665 participants were included in the pooled analysis on BMD at the femoral neck after 12 months. Evidence for both outcomes was moderate-certainty (downgraded for indirectness as a surrogate marker for osteoporosis) with low risk of bias. Overall, the bisphosphonate groups reported stabilisation or increase in BMD, while the control groups showed decreased BMD over the study period. At the lumbar spine, there was an absolute increase in BMD of 3.5% with bisphosphonates (2.90% to 4.10% higher) with a relative improvement of 1.10% with bisphosphonates (0.91% to 1.29%); NNTB 3 (2 to 3). At the femoral neck, the absolute difference in BMD was 2.06% higher in the bisphosphonate group compared to the control group (1.45% to 2.68% higher) with a relative improvement of 1.29% (0.91% to 1.69%); NNTB 5 (4 to 7).</P>
<P>Pooled analysis on serious adverse events included 15 trials (1703 participants) with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). In this analysis 131/811 (or 162 per 1000) people experienced serious adverse events in the control group compared to 136/892 (or 147 per 1000; range 120 to 181) in the bisphosphonate group; absolute increased harm of 0% more serious adverse events (2% fewer to 2% more); a relative per cent change with 9% improvement (12% worse to 26% better).</P>
<P>Pooled analysis for withdrawals due to adverse events included 15 trials (1790 patients) with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). In this analysis 63/866 (or 73 per 1000) people withdrew in the control group compared to 76/924 (or 77 per 1000; range 56 to 107) in the bisphosphonate group; an absolute increased harm of 1% more withdrawals with bisphosphonates (95% CI 1% fewer to 3% more); a relative per cent change 6% worse (95% CI 47% worse to 23% better).</P>
<P>Quality of life was not assessed in any of the trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-15 05:38:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was high-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures with data extending to 24 months of use. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in preventing nonvertebral fractures. There was moderate-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in preventing and treating corticosteroid-induced bone loss at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Regarding harm, there was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. We are cautious in interpreting these data as markers for harm and tolerability due to the potential for bias.</P>
<P>Overall, our review supports the use of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and the prevention and treatment of steroid-induced bone loss.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-18 07:44:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-14 05:18:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Corticosteroids are widely used in inflammatory conditions as an immunosuppressive agent. Diseases treated with corticosteroids include connective tissue diseases, respiratory diseases, haematological diseases, inflammatory bowel disease and organ transplantation. Bone loss is a serious side effect of this therapy, commonly referred to as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), and is likely mediated through a variety of mechanisms.</P>
<P>The most widely accepted mechanisms in the pathogenesis of GIOP are the direct inhibition of bone formation and increase in bone resorption. Inhibition of bone formation is mediated by a decrease in osteoblast differentiation, impaired maturation and function, and premature osteoblast apoptotic death, as evidenced by decreased serum osteocalcin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Canalis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canalis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2003</LINK>). Glucocorticoids enhance osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by suppressing osteoprotegerin; stimulating RANK/RANKL; and decreasing apoptosis, all of which result in increased levels of osteoclasts. There is also evidence of decreased calcium absorption, increased calcium excretion and decreased serum concentration of sex hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Canalis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canalis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2003</LINK>). In addition to their effect on bone density, steroids are known to affect bone architecture and quality (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2002</LINK>). These two factors likely contribute to a lower BMD threshold for fracture in people with GIOP.</P>
<P>There is controversy in the literature regarding the minimum dose and duration of corticosteroids required to produce bone loss and fractures, with reports of doses as low as 2.5 to 7.5 mg/day leading to statistically significant bone loss and a 2.5 fold increase in vertebral fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Canalis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canalis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinbuch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinbuch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2002</LINK>). Fracture risk may be confounded by the underlying inflammatory disease processes themselves, which may independently lead to bone loss and fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Saag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-06-01 10:22:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Claire S Allen">
<P>Bisphosphonates have been used to treat osteoporosis since the 1990s and are considered to be first line treatment when pharmacological therapy is recommended. Various types of bisphosphonates exist, most commonly in oral pill form, although intravenous bisphosphonates are also available and in North America are reserved traditionally for individuals who are unable to tolerate oral bisphosphonates. Oral regimes include daily or weekly administration, whereas intravenous bisphosphonates are administered every few months or on a yearly basis (<LINK REF="REF-National-Osteoporosis-Foundation-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Osteoporosis Foundation 2014</LINK>)<I>. </I>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-07-18 07:44:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bisphosphonates reduce bone loss through various mechanisms of actions that are not fully understood. In general, bisphosphonates are shown to reduce the rate of bone turnover through a strong affinity for bone mineral, which translates to a decrease in bone loss. They also have an inhibitory effect that decreases the number and activity of osteoclasts, which dissolve bone as part of the normal bone turnover process (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2007</LINK>). Bisphosphonate efficacy, measured as per cent change in BMD over one year, ranges from -3% to +12% in bisphosphonate studies.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-18 05:57:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A consequence of low bone mass is the development of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. GIOP often manifests as clinically silent until the development of a fracture. BMD is commonly used as an intermediate outcome to extrapolate fracture risk, however it should be noted that the correlation between BMD and fracture risk that exists in post-menopausal osteoporosis has not been established in corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. Therefore it is important to have direct evidence of the benefit of bisphosphonates in reducing fracture risk in GIOP.</P>
<P>The routine use of prophylactic therapy to prevent bone loss and fractures is suboptimal despite recommendations from American College of Rheumatology (ACR) practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Grossman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 2010</LINK>). Recent North American prescription patterns for GIOP prevention demonstrate a prevalence of anti-resorptive co-prescription of only 15% to 37% in people receiving long-term steroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mckeown-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mckeown 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Cochrane Systematic Review and meta-analysis is useful to determine the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment of GIOP and fractures in order to justify and encourage their routine use.</P>

<P>Participants were men or women over the age of 18 with underlying inflammatory disorders, initiating treatment or currently being treated with systemic corticosteroids, and who had not received bisphosphonates in the six months prior to the start of the study. We defined prevention studies by bisphosphonate treatment starting within three months of initiating corticosteroids, while treatment (secondary prevention) studies included those that initiated bisphosphonate treatment beyond three months of starting corticosteroid therapy. These definitions are widely used in GIOP literature and are based on the notion that rapid bone loss is seen within the first three to six months of corticosteroid use (<LINK REF="REF-Canalis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canalis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to controversy in the literature regarding low-dose steroids and the risk of osteoporosis and fracture, we used only those trials where the mean corticosteroid dose was 5 mg/day or higher. Participants had to be continuing corticosteroid treatment throughout the entire course of the study. We excluded trials that included people with transplant-associated steroid use from the review.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-07-18 07:45:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We analysed the results of the trials using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 statistical software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We conducted pooled analyses for dichotomous variables (incident vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events) using the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We analysed continuous data (BMD outcomes) as the mean difference (MD) in BMD between the two treatment groups and the corresponding standard deviation. That is, the per cent change in treatment group BMD minus the per cent change in placebo group BMD. We conducted analysis separately for bone loss at the femoral and lumbar sites, because of the differential effects of corticosteroids on cortical and trabecular bone mass (<LINK REF="REF-Rickers-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickers 1984</LINK>). Each trial was weighted taking into account sample size and variance in the outcome variable.</P>
<P>To enhance the interpretability of our outcomes we also calculated relative per cent changes; absolute risk differences; and for outcomes with statistically significant differences between intervention groups, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). These calculations are described below under the heading &#8216;Summary of findings' table.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>Our major outcomes (incident vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, BMD change after 12 months at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and quality of life) are presented in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> produced using GRADEpro software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK>). This provides information on the certainty of evidence, the magnitude of intervention effect, and the summary of data available for each outcome. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome was graded (high, moderate, low and very low) using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>). For dichotomous outcomes with low event rates, we used an optimal information size (OIS) calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Brant-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brant 2014</LINK>) to assess the precision of data.</P>
<P>We included the absolute risk difference and the relative per cent change for each outcome. For statistically significant differences, we also calculated NNTB or NNTH.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the absolute risk difference using the risk difference (RD) statistic in RevMan 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) expressed as a percentage; we calculated the relative per cent change as risk ratio (RR) minus one and expressed it as a percentage; we calculated the NNTB/NNTH from the control group event rate and the risk ratio using the Visual RX NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we calculated absolute risk difference as the mean difference between intervention and control group. We calculated the relative difference as the mean difference divided by the mean baseline risk of the control group, calculated in RevMan 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) using generic inverse variance. We calculated NNTB/NNTH using the Wells calculator software available at Cochrane Musculoskeletal editorial office. There are no published or agreed upon minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for BMD results that we are aware of. In cases where this occurs, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommends using a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.5 as an estimate of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for each outcome, a rule of thumb representing a moderate effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>). It is difficult to ascribe a minimal clinically important difference in terms of per cent change in BMD as a predictable correlation between BMD and fracture risk has not been established in the GIOP setting. BMD changes only account for a small increase in fracture risk (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Six of the included trials reported on multiple treatment groups. The standard-dose arms and control groups were included in the major analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herrala-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Herrala 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>). If a low-dose arm was reported, we included the studies in a minor outcome analysis of standard-dose versus low-dose bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>). One of the multi-group trials using clodronate reported on groups with dosages of 1600 mg and 2400 mg daily, which were both higher than the current standard and therefore not eligible for the standard-dose versus low-dose meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Herrala-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Herrala 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another trial used two distinct pair-wise comparisons with two independent treatment groups and two independent placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Sambrook-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sambrook 2003</LINK>). In this study, one pair-wise comparison involved steroid use of less than six months and the other comparison involved steroid use for longer than six months.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prevention versus treatment of GIOP</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen trials involved the prevention of GIOP and 14 trials involved the treatment of GIOP. For trials that had mixed prevention and treatment individuals, we categorised the trial based on whether the majority of participants were considered 'prevention' or 'treatment' as per our criteria described in <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Saadati-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saadati 2008</LINK> was unclear in describing the type of study so we categorised it as a treatment trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incident radiographic vertebral fractures</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-one trials reported this outcome, 12 trials were included and nine trials excluded from meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Two trials combined fracture data from their 5 mg and 10 mg alendronate treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>) and although 5 mg daily alendronate was not considered a standard dose, we included these data in the analysis. Of the 12 included studies, seven were prevention trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abitbol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abitbol 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adachi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Nijs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">De Nijs 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tee 2012</LINK>) and five were treatment trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sambrook-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sambrook 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since fractures occur at a variable length of time after the onset of osteoporosis, we included trials in which the follow-up for new fractures occurred between 12 to 24 months, to better ascertain the benefits of bisphosphonates in fracture prevention. We excluded one trial that assessed incident fractures after four years (<LINK REF="STD-Frediani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frediani 2003</LINK>) as the timeline differed too greatly from all other trials. Four trials were excluded because they only reported radiographically confirmed symptomatic vertebral fractures and not all participants were screened for vertebral fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Roux-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortet-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cortet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geusens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Geusens 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoch 2009</LINK>). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1999</LINK> because vertebral radiographs were reported on less than half of completing participants, despite a protocol stating routine radiographic screening at baseline and 52 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Saadati-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saadati 2008</LINK> did not outline their assessment criteria for fractures and was therefore excluded. One trial reported the number of vertebral fractures rather than the number of participants who experienced fractures and could not be included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Skingle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Skingle 1997</LINK>). Fracture data from <LINK REF="STD-Adachi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 2001</LINK> were not included as this study was a partial cohort from <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Fracture Assessment Criteria</HEADING>
<P>Methods for assessing incident vertebral fractures included quantitative morphometry, semiquantitative grading and a spinal deformity index. Data were analysed regardless of which of the three methods of fracture determination was used.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK> and its extension study <LINK REF="STD-Adachi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 2001</LINK> assessed fractures using both semiquantitative and quantitative methods. For these two trials we included the semiquantitative data as more trials reported incident fractures using this method.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2000</LINK>) used the quantitative morphometric criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Kiel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiel 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Melton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1993</LINK> in which incident fractures were defined as either a reduction in vertebral height of 15% or more (for intact vertebrae at baseline) or 4 mm or more (for fractured vertebrae at baseline). Two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abitbol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abitbol 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>) defined incident fractures by quantitative morphometry as a reduction in vertebral height of 20% or 4 mm or more, or both, based on criteria outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Genant-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genant 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>Six trials used semiquantitative grading with a minimum reduction in vertebral height of 20% as criteria for incident vertebral fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Adachi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adachi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sambrook-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sambrook 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tee 2012</LINK>) as per <LINK REF="REF-Genant-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genant 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kujik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kujik 1995</LINK> and one trial used or a reduction in height of 15% or more (<LINK REF="STD-De-Nijs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">De Nijs 2006</LINK>) according to <LINK REF="REF-Kleerekoper-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleerekoper 1984</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two trials used the <LINK REF="REF-Minne-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minne 1988</LINK> spinal deformity index (<LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 2001</LINK>), which determines the extent of vertebral compression by comparison of the actual vertebral body height to the presumable original height.</P>

<P>Thirteen trials reported this outcome, nine trials were included and four trials excluded from meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Fracture sites included but were not limited to the hip, wrist, forearm, and midfoot. No atypical femur fractures were reported in any of the included trials. We reported all nonvertebral fracture data together as the majority of trials did not include complete information on specific fracture sites. Three trials reported nonvertebral fractures but provided the total number of fractures rather than the number of participants suffering from fractures and were therefore not included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Adachi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoch 2009</LINK>). Another trial reported nonvertebral fractures occurring after four years and was not included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Frediani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frediani 2003</LINK>).

<P>From our search of the databases, clinical trials registries and handsearching, we excluded 534 of the 587 articles that underwent full-text review.

See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for complete details. During data extraction from 39 studies, we excluded 11 for using only non-standard bisphosphonate doses (<LINK REF="STD-Benucci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Benucci 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fujii-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fujii 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jinnouchi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jinnouchi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitazaki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitazaki 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayamada-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayamada 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okada-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Okada 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takeda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Takeda 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takei-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Takei 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toukap-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Toukap 2005</LINK>), and we categorised <LINK REF="STD-Ozoran-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ozoran 2007</LINK> as 'awaiting classification' pending data clarification from the study authors due to insufficient reporting of relevant outcome data.

This appears to explain the significant heterogeneity in the prevention analysis. There were no parenteral bisphosphonates used in treatment trials.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-21 19:49:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out this review to evaluate the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates in GIOP. We examine benefits in terms of fracture outcomes and BMD change; and include subgroup analyses of primary prevention versus treatment. The review provides new data on oral and parenteral bisphosphonates and a direct comparison of low and standard bisphosphonate doses. Harm data include serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fracture Data</HEADING>
<P>The most clinically relevant outcome is the effect of bisphosphonates on fracture prevention. Results from our analyses show that bisphosphonates reduce the total number of incident vertebral fractures by approximately 40% with a NNTB of 31. There was no statistically significant reduction in fractures at nonvertebral sites, including the hip.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Harm Data</HEADING>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences in either the incidence of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between active drug and control groups. The most frequently reported adverse events in our review were musculoskeletal (myalgias and arthralgias) and upper gastrointestinal; though typically mild in nature and seen in both the bisphosphonate and control groups. Gastrointestinal side effects, or even fear of experiencing them, are cited as a primary reason for decreased compliance or discontinuation of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Pazianas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pazianas 2011</LINK>). Other common associated side effects cited in the literature include transient asymptomatic hypercalcaemia and a transient acute phase response (two to three days of flu-like symptoms most often associated with the initiation of intravenous treatment). These were seen sporadically in the trials included in our review.</P>
<P>Although high-certainty epidemiological evidence is limited, osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare but serious adverse event that is associated with bisphosphonate use; specifically with long-standing use and frequent intravenous dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Pazianas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pazianas 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates are associated with an increased risk of atypical femur fractures (subtrochanteric or diaphyseal). Estimated incidences vary from 12.5 to 31 of 10,000 people/year with approximately 10 years of alendronate exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Abrahamsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrahamsen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dell 2012</LINK>). Current data are conflicting, however most studies agree that the absolute risk of atypical femur fracture with bisphosphonates is low. A recent meta-analysis pooled nine observational trials and one RCT (n = 658,497) and found a statistically significant increased risk of atypical femur fractures with bisphosphonates; adjusted OR 1.99 (95% CI 1.28 to 3.10) (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2015</LINK>). Although the clinical implication is uncertain, both long-term steroid use and systemic inflammatory disease processes are considered to be risk factors associated with atypical femur fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neither osteonecrosis of the jaw nor atypical femur fractures were reported in any of the trials included in our review.</P>
<P>Experts still recommend caution in using bisphosphonates in women of childbearing age until further systematic research has been performed (<LINK REF="REF-Djokanovic-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djokanovic 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Losada-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Losada 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">BMD Data</HEADING>
<P>Our major BMD outcomes show statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in bone density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck after 12 months, with MD of 3.50% and 2.06%, respectively. The NNTB at the lumbar spine after 12 months is 3, and the NNTB at the femoral neck after 12 months is 5. It is generally believed that steroid-induced bone loss is not as prominent in cortical bone (<LINK REF="REF-Rickers-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickers 1984</LINK>) and that changes in BMD are not as dramatic at the femoral neck, as it takes longer for cortical bone to turn over. Our results support these beliefs and data from the placebo arms of the trials show a smaller magnitude of bone loss at the femoral neck than the lumbar spine.</P>
<P>Our NNTBs for the change in BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck are based on an SMD of 0.5 as an estimate of the minimal clinically important difference for BMD change (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>). It is difficult to express our findings in terms of a minimally clinically relevant change in BMD as that value has not been established for GIOP. Fractures in GIOP often occur at a higher BMD than seen in primary osteoporosis and, unlike primary osteoporosis, a predictable correlation between BMD and fracture risk has not been established in the GIOP setting. Furthermore, improvement in BMD only accounts for a small part of the reduction in vertebral fracture risk observed with antiresorptive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A previous meta-analysis evaluating BMD improvements and vertebral fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women and elderly men suggests that each 1% improvement in spine BMD during anti-resorptive therapy is associated with a 0.03 decrease in relative risk of vertebral fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2002</LINK>). Although the meta-analysis is neither specific to GIOP nor to bisphosphonates; it does provide a rough clinical context to consider our findings of a 3.5% difference between treatment and control group lumbar spine BMD after 12 months of bisphosphonate therapy.</P>
<P>The natural history of patients starting steroid therapy based on control arms in our prevention trials is to see a 1% to 6% decrease in lumbar spine BMD and 1% to 4% decrease in femoral neck BMD in the first year of treatment.</P>
<P>We were interested in analysing the prevention and treatment trials separately as the two clinical scenarios are distinct. In general, the prevention trials showed greater bone loss in the control arm with maintenance or small bone accrual in the treatment arm. In contrast, the treatment trials showed a greater degree of accrual in the treatment arm with less dramatic bone loss in the control arm. This supports the belief that bone loss is more prominent in the early stages of corticosteroid therapy, with a slower rate of loss as therapy continues. As such, prophylactic therapy demonstrates an ability to reduce bone loss, whereas bisphosphonate treatment provides an opportunity to build bone mass in chronic steroid-using people.</P>
<P>We included post-hoc subgroup analyses based on gender and menopausal status (men, premenopausal women, postmenopausal women) however we are cautious in interpreting these results because subgroup comparisons are observational in nature (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). We found that there remains a similar magnitude of effect in the subgroups as compared to the whole group analyses except for a wider spread of variability, perhaps due to fewer trials in each analysis. Results for the female groups at the femoral neck were not statistically significant. There was no significant heterogeneity in the male analyses but significant heterogeneity in the female plots. <LINK REF="STD-Frediani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frediani 2003</LINK> was a visible outlier in the female plots and differed from the other trials by its use of parenteral bisphosphonates, which may explain such a difference. Our a priori sensitivity analyses that separated oral and enteral bisphosphonates revealed that heterogeneity was likely in part due to this factor. Removal of <LINK REF="STD-Frediani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frediani 2003</LINK> reduced the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic in all female analyses (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0% for premenopausal lumbar spine BMD analysis; I<SUP>2</SUP>= 43% for postmenopausal lumbar spine BMD analysis; I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0% for premenopausal and postmenopausal femoral neck BMD analyses; results not shown). These post-hoc analyses included mixed data from prevention and treatment trials. Sub-subgroup analyses, broken down by gender and prevention or treatment, could not be performed as data were not presented in the trials at that level of detail.</P>
<P>Given the poor absorption of oral bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="REF-Gertz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2007</LINK>) there is perceived differential efficacy based on route of administration. Our analysis showed that the effect size of BMD at lumbar spine differed between parenteral bisphosphonate trials and oral bisphosphonate trials (5.12% and 3.25%, respectively). This difference in effect size between the parenteral analysis and oral analysis was also seen at the femoral neck (4.56% and 1.92%, respectively). In the lumbar spine BMD analysis all parenteral bisphosphonates were prevention studies which likely contributed to the significant heterogeneity in the lumbar spine BMD prevention subgroup analysis. A sub-subgroup analysis of parenteral and oral bisphosphonates subsequently eliminated the heterogeneity in the lumbar spine BMD prevention subgroup.</P>
<P>There are few head-to-head trials of oral versus parenteral bisphosphonates in GIOP. A 12-month RCT including 265 men, divided into prevention and treatment subgroups, compared a single 5 mg infusion of zoledronic acid to 5 mg daily oral risedronate. The authors found a statistically significant increase in lumbar spine BMD of 2.7% (95% CI 0.99% to 4.43%) with zoledronic acid over risedronate in their prevention subgroup. The treatment difference at the femoral neck was not statistically significant in the prevention subgroup at 1.38% (95% CI -0.18% to 2.95%) (<LINK REF="REF-Sambrook-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sambrook 2012</LINK>). Another RCT (n = 771) found statistically significant improvements in BMD at 12 months with zoledronic acid over risedronate at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck in the prevention subgroups; 1.96% (95% CI 1.04 to 2.88) and 1.33% (95% CI 0.41% to 2.25%) (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2009</LINK>). Overall, parenteral regimes were vastly preferred over oral regimes in these trials. Route of administration is a factor to be considered in the treatment of GIOP.</P>
<P>We analysed head-to-head comparisons of the low- and standard-dose bisphosphonate treatment groups in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>). The standard-dose bisphosphonate groups showed a small increase in benefit at the lumbar spine (0.95%, 95% CI 0.37% to 1.53%). The data suggest that even low-dose bisphosphonates can be beneficial in the treatment of GIOP.</P>
<P>It was interesting to see that an ad-hoc pooled analysis of low-dose bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boutsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998</LINK>) compared to treatment with calcium or vitamin D alone resulted in a mean difference of 3.15% (95% CI 1.87% to 4.44%) at the lumbar spine. This effect size is not out of the range of our pooled estimate for all studies using standard-dose bisphosphonates supporting the suggestion that low-dose bisphosphonates may be beneficial (results not shown).</P>
<P>There is a perception that newer bisphosphonates are more effective than etidronate in treating osteoporosis. In both the vertebral fracture analyses and both the BMD analyses of oral bisphosphonates there was no heterogeneity among the studies, which included three different types of bisphosphonates. We did not perform a post-hoc analysis on newer bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>One critique of bisphosphonate studies is the lack of long-term follow-up. For this updated review we decided to include the analysis of BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck after 18 to 24 months. Results from these analyses show increases in bone density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck with mean differences of 5.49% and 3.28%, respectively. This suggests ongoing efficacy up to two years.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 07:05:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review examined the evidence from 27 RCTs for the use of bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment of GIOP. We included 25 new studies for this update, and, due to more rigorous inclusion criteria, only two of the 13 studies from the existing review, as there were numerous higher quality studies published since the original review. A variety of outcomes measured both the benefits and the harms of bisphosphonates. Benefits included decreased bone loss or bone accrual at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck and a reduced risk of vertebral fractures. Although fracture outcome data may have more direct clinical relevance than BMD outcome measurements, most GIOP studies reported BMD as the primary outcome. Vertebral fracture data were sufficient to address the objectives of our review, however data on nonvertebral fractures often lacked detail and we were unable to examine the incidence of hip and wrist fractures separately. None of the trials reported on quality of life so we were unable to include this as an outcome measure in our review.</P>
<P>This updated review provides confirmatory evidence that bisphosphonates, alone or in combination with calcium or vitamin D, or both, are more beneficial than calcium or vitamin D, or both, alone or with placebo, for both the prevention and treatment of GIOP at the hip and spine. The trials used in this review used similar inclusion criteria, however the participant groups differed between trials in terms of the prior steroid usage, baseline BMD measurements and prevalent fractures. This updated review provides new data on the benefits of bisphosphonates in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures and the prevention versus treatment of GIOP. We provide new data on the different effect sizes seen in oral and parenteral bisphosphonate clinical trials, and the potential benefit of low-dose bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>Regarding bisphosphonate harms, we could not find any statistically significant differences in the occurrence of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between the bisphosphonate and control groups. In nine of the trials analysed, the protocols for the collection of harm data were unclear and may have resulted in biased results. Some of the included studies based their power calculations solely on benefit outcomes and may not have been sufficiently powered to adequately assess harm outcomes. Although findings on serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events are important to consider in evaluating bisphosphonate therapy, we are cautious in interpreting these data as markers for harm and tolerability due to the potential for bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> shows the overall certainty and importance of the body of evidence using the GRADE Working Group Approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>). We rated the certainty of the evidence for vertebral fractures as high, which indicates that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. We downgraded the nonvertebral fracture outcome to low-certainty evidence for imprecision due to a total sample size below the calculated optimal information size, and risk of bias for being a patient-reported subjective outcome. We rated the certainty of remaining outcomes as moderate, which indicates that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. BMD outcomes were downgraded for indirectness as surrogate markers for osteoporosis. Serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were downgraded for imprecision due to small total sample size and 95% CI including the possibility of no effect and appreciable harm. We assessed all outcomes as important in terms of their impact on decisions regarding optimal management.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-28 17:01:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Claire S Allen">
<P>Our methods and reporting are based on the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We devised a thorough search strategy with no language restrictions and believe that we identified all relevant studies. Two review authors in various combinations independently assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias and extracted data for analysis. The biggest limitations of the review process were the heterogeneity between the trials, likely related to different patient characteristics (differences in underlying inflammatory conditions, steroid doses, and prevalent fractures) and that some trials reported outcomes but did not provide data in a form that could be extracted for meta-analysis.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-15 07:14:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings are similar to those reported in the 1999 Cochrane Review evaluating the efficacy of bisphosphonates in steroid-induced osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Homik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homik 1999</LINK>). As there were very few high-quality papers included in the original review, this updated review includes data from only two of the 13 studies that were included in the original version. Therefore, the effect estimates have changed. While the original review was not able to establish bisphosphonate benefit beyond one year or against spinal fractures, the meta-analyses in this updated review have provided conclusive data on the above measures of benefit.</P>
<P>A subsequent systematic review by the Health Technology Assessment programme of the NHS by <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK> assessed the clinical effectiveness of numerous active and inactive treatments for GIOP. Outcome measures included incident vertebral fractures, incident nonvertebral fractures, associated effects, compliance and continuance. <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK> included 23 bisphosphonate studies, of which only eight overlap with the 27 studies in our updated review. Many of the studies in <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK> were not eligible for inclusion in our review for using active comparators or including participants with transplant-associated steroid use. <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK> analysed different bisphosphonate types individually and found that, in the non-transplant population, only risedronate 5 mg/day showed a statistically significant reduction in vertebral fractures as compared to placebo or no treatment. No intervention was shown to be beneficial in preventing nonvertebral fractures. In our analysis of vertebral fractures nine of the 10 studies used alendronate and showed a statistically significant reduction in vertebral fractures.</P>
<P>There are some other differences between our updated review and that of <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK>. Our review includes 14 bisphosphonate trials that were not included in <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK> because fracture was not the primary outcome. Our fracture analyses include only studies with standardised radiographic screening of vertebral fractures in order to ensure complete capture of fracture incidence, whereas many of the studies in <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK> report only symptomatic fractures. It is known that up to 65% of vertebral fractures may be asymptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2007</LINK>
<I>).</I> Combining all types of bisphosphonate in our pooled analyses allows for a stronger effect size estimate. As their report shows, most studies only achieved statistically significant findings in pooled analyses.</P>
<P>Current American College of Rheumatology clinical practice guidelines for post-menopausal women and men 50 years old or more recommend bisphosphonate therapy for GIOP based on FRAX risk assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Grossman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 2010</LINK>). Bisphosphonate therapy is recommended in low-risk patients (FRAX &lt; 10% for 10-year major osteoporotic fracture) on corticosteroid treatment for greater or equal to 7.5 mg/day for three or more months' duration; moderate-risk patients (FRAX 10% to 20%) on doses less than 7.5 mg/day for three or more months' duration; and high-risk patients (FRAX &gt; 20%) on any dose and duration of corticosteroid (<LINK REF="REF-Grossman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 2010</LINK>). In comparison, the International Osteoporosis Foundation and European Calcified Tissue Society framework for GIOP management of post-menopausal women and men 50 years old or more recommend treatment to be considered in patients on corticosteroid treatment greater or equal to 7.5 mg/day for three or more months' duration with a previous fracture or that are greater than 70 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Lekamwasam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lekamwasam 2012</LINK>). For those with no previous fracture, younger than 70 years, or on corticosteroid doses less than 7.5 mg/day, FRAX assessment with or without BMD assessment is recommended to further guide decision-making (<LINK REF="REF-Lekamwasam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lekamwasam 2012</LINK>). Our study supports the use of bisphosphonates in people who are either starting corticosteroids or on established corticosteroid therapy.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-15 07:18:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-15 07:16:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is high-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures in people on corticosteroids with data extending to 24 months of use. There is moderate-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in preventing and treating corticosteroid-induced bone loss at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Though the magnitude of effect on BMD differs between sites and whether used for treatment or prophylaxis, in all groups there are statistically and clinically relevant findings. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in preventing nonvertebral fractures, although the low number of events reported in all studies makes it difficult to show a benefit without a larger sample size.</P>
<P>Prophylactic therapy demonstrates an ability to reduce bone loss, whereas treatment of GIOP provides an opportunity to build bone mass in chronic steroid-using patients. There is a trend toward greater benefit with the use of IV bisphosphonates although this review was not set up as a comparative effectiveness analysis. Notions of increased efficacy in IV therapy as compared to oral have yet to be firmly established in the setting of GIOP. It was interesting to see that low-dose bisphosphonate regimes had only a slightly lower benefit as compared to standard doses given the poor absorption of oral bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated with the number of reported side effects being similar between treatment and placebo groups. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms and musculoskeletal pain are the most common side effects reported and are typically mild in nature. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events.</P>
<P>We conclude that the outcomes assessed in this review are important in terms of their impact on decisions regarding optimal GIOP management. Based on the currently available moderate- to high-certainty evidence, our review supports the use of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and the prevention and treatment of steroid-induced bone loss and is consistent with current guidelines.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-15 07:18:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further high-quality research on vertebral fractures is unlikely to substantially change the conclusions of this review. The benefits of bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment of GIOP is well established when BMD data are used as surrogate markers for fracture risk. More research needs to be conducted into long-term nonvertebral fracture prevention in this patient population. Recommendations regarding the routine use of these medications in people on corticosteroids require further research to answer questions regarding cost-effectiveness. Further head-to-head trials comparing parenteral to oral bisphosphonates with fracture outcome data are needed to investigate the potential increased efficacy of parenteral bisphosphonates in GIOP. Finally, confirmation regarding the efficacy of low-dose bisphosphonates in the GIOP population is required.</P>

<P>We have updated the methods in the review since the original review in accordance with current Cochrane and Cochrane Musculoskeletal recommendations. Due to the increased number of high-quality studies that have been published since the original review, we have made our selection criteria more rigorous to include only RCTs that measured BMD by DEXA (and not quantitative CT). We have added four more outcomes: number of participants with new radiographic non-vertebral fractures; quality of life; serious adverse events; and direct comparison of lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD change using low-dose versus standard-dose bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>We have changed the minimum steroid dose of 7.5 mg/day from the original review to include a minimum of 5 mg/day to reflect current literature on the effect of low-dose steroids.</P>
<P>We have altered our time points for BMD analysis to reflect clinical relevance. Specifically, we have removed the six-month time point and changed our two-year time point to include data between 18 to 24 months.</P>
<P>In the original review, sensitivity analyses were performed for methodological quality, BMD technique and study duration. The sensitivity analyses in our updated review were performed to evaluate the effect of risk of bias in included studies, based on the exclusion of non-blinded studies, and route of administration (oral and parenteral). This change reflects differences in the certainty of evidence and advances in therapy since the original review.</P>
