<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Are antibiotics an effective treatment for toxoplasma retinochoroiditis?</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
<BR/>Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis occurs when a parasite called <I>Toxoplasma gondii </I>gets into the retina (the light-sensitive layer inside the eye) and the choroid (layer of the eyeball near the retina). This causes inflammation that can scar the retina and reduce vision. Symptoms include a sudden feeling of discomfort in the eye and loss of vision, which usually resolve spontaneously within six to eight weeks. The infection can keep returning, increasing the chances of damage. Antibiotics are sometimes used to try to reduce the inflammation and scarring, or to prevent the infection from re-emerging, but it is unclear how well they work.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We found four studies with a total of 268 participants. These studies were conducted in Brazil, the UK, and the US. The evidence is current to 22 February 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Only one of the four studies compared the effect of antibiotic treatment for 12 months with placebo on visual acuity and found similar changes in both groups. Three studies examined the effect of antibiotics on reducing the number of recurring episodes of the disease. Two of these three studies were conducted in Brazil in adults infected with the more aggressive South American strains of the parasite, which can cause frequently recurring eye symptoms. The studies from Brazil found that the long-term antibiotics over 14 and 12 months, respectively, reduced the number of recurrent episodes of retinochoroiditis. The other study did not find that short-term (eight weeks) treatment with antibiotics made any difference. Two studies reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in antibiotic-treated compared with untreated participants, and one study reported no changes. Two studies investigated side effects of giving antibiotics such as decreased white blood cells, loss of appetite, rashes and other allergic reactions and found only weak evidence that antibiotics increase the risk of side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There were problems with the design, conduct, and analyses of all of the studies, which could have biased the results. There was a lack of evidence about whether antibiotics (short or long term) prevent vision loss. More trials are needed, including trials of newer antibiotics.</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials that compared any antibiotic treatment against placebo or no treatment. We excluded trials that included immunocompromised participants.

<P>The primary outcomes for this review were visual acuity at least three months after treatment and risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptoms and signs of intraocular inflammation, size of lesion, and adverse events. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-06 07:42:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials that randomised a total of 268 participants met the inclusion criteria. In all four studies antibiotic was administered orally.</P>
<P>One study conducted in Brazil in both adults and children compared trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol over 20 months to no treatment and was judged to be at high risk of performance, detection, and attrition bias. The other three studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo. We judged these three studies to be at a mixture of low or unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting. One study conducted in the US in adults studied pyrimethamine-trisulfapyrimidine for eight weeks; one study conducted in the UK in children and adults evaluated pyrimethamine for four weeks; and one study conducted in Brazil in adults investigated trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months. In the last study, all participants had active retinochoroiditis and were treated with antibiotics for 45 days prior to randomisation to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo.</P>
<P>Only the study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole over 12 months, in participants with healed lesions, reported the effect of treatment on visual acuity. People treated with antibiotics may have a similar change in visual acuity compared with people treated with placebo at one year (mean difference -1.00 letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.93 to 5.93 letters; 93 participants; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Treatment with antibiotics probably reduces the risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.63; 227 participants; 3 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; moderate-quality evidence); similar results were seen for acute and chronic retinochoroiditis.</P>
<P>The UK study of pyrimethamine for four weeks reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in treated compared with control participants (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.19; 29 participants; low-quality evidence). The study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months stated that the severity of inflammation was higher in the comparator group when compared to the antibiotic-treated group but did not provide further details. In the US study of pyrimethamine-trisulfapyrimidine for eight weeks intraocular inflammation had almost completely resolved by eight weeks in all participants, however in this study all participants received steroid treatment.</P>
<P>Two studies (UK and US studies) reported an increased risk of adverse events in treated participants. These were a fall in haemoglobin, leucocyte, and platelet count, nausea, loss of appetite, rash, and arthralgia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-05-05 01:13:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment with antibiotics probably reduces the risk of recurrent toxoplasma retinochoroiditis, but there is currently no good evidence that this leads to better visual outcomes. However, absence of evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect. Further trials of people with acute and chronic toxoplasma retinochoroiditis affecting any part of the retina are required to determine the effects of antibiotic treatment on visual outcomes.</P>

<P>
<I>Toxoplasma gondii</I> (<I>T.gondii</I>) is a ubiquitous human parasite. Infection of the retina results in acute intraocular inflammation (retinochoroiditis) and the formation of a retinochoroidal scar. Retinochoroiditis can recur at any time, often years after first infection, and may be due to the local release of <I>T.gondii </I>parasites from cysts in the retina (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2003</LINK>). Alternatively, retinal antigens normally hidden from immune surveillance may be released due to cyst reactivation and stimulate an inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute toxoplasma retinochoroiditis may cause sudden onset of visual loss and pain, sometimes associated with floaters or photophobia. Symptoms often resolve spontaneously within six to eight weeks, leaving a healed retinochoroidal scar (<LINK REF="REF-Rothova-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothova 1993a</LINK>). Scars involving the posterior pole (within the macular arcade or near the optic nerve head) or very large lesions leading to vitreous opacifications can permanently impair visual acuity. Peripheral lesions may cause field defects but are unlikely to affect visual acuity.</P>
<P>The lifetime risk of symptoms due to acute toxoplasma retinochoroiditis ranges from 18 out of 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 11 to 25) for people born in the UK to 382 out of 100,000 (95% CI 99 to 664) for people born in West Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1999</LINK>). The presentation of retinochoroiditis following prenatal or postnatal infection is similar and can only be distinguished in people with systemic signs of toxoplasmosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1999</LINK>). The risk of retinochoroiditis after prenatal toxoplasmosis is 20% in the early childhood years (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guerina-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerina 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lebech-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebech 1999</LINK>), and may be as high as 80% by adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Koppe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koppe 1986</LINK>). Less information is available on the risk of retinochoroiditis after postnatal infection; reports range from 0.3% to 0.7% one year after infection, in <LINK REF="REF-Burnett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnett 1998</LINK>, to 3% (duration of follow-up unknown), in <LINK REF="REF-Perkins-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkins 1973</LINK>. However, as prenatal toxoplasmosis is approximately 1000 times less common than postnatally acquired infection, the vast majority of toxoplasma retinochoroiditis seen by ophthalmologists is due to postnatal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2000a</LINK>). Much higher rates of toxoplasma infection and ocular disease are seen in South America than in North America and Europe, and ocular manifestations are more severe in South America (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2008</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-05-05 01:48:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of treatment for toxoplasma retinochoroiditis is to reduce the risk of permanent visual impairment (by reducing the size of the retinochoroidal scar), the risk of recurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Rothova-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothova 1993b</LINK>), and the severity and duration of acute symptoms. Antibiotics are usually given for six to eight weeks. Adjunctive steroid therapy may sometimes be used to reduce the duration and severity of acute symptoms due to intraocular inflammation. Infants with prenatal toxoplasmosis but without retinochoroiditis are often given prophylactic treatment for a year or more to reduce the risk of retinochoroiditis (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1999</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-06-10 14:23:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-05-05 01:51:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for toxoplasma retinochoroiditis (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2004</LINK>). As a result, the type of antibiotics prescribed varies (<LINK REF="REF-Engstrom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engstrom 1991</LINK>), and some clinicians do not treat patients with acute retinochoroiditis in the periphery of the retina (<LINK REF="STD-Rothova-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothova 1993b</LINK>). In addition, the antibiotics used have adverse effects. We systematically reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for toxoplasma retinochoroiditis.</P>

We judged the study by <LINK REF="STD-Silveira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Silveira 2002</LINK> to be at high risk of bias as participants were randomised to treatment or no treatment, and the clinician who entered them into the study carried out the follow-up assessments.</P>

<P>Four trials that randomised a total of 268 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two studies were conducted in Brazil, one in the UK, and one in the US. One study compared antibiotic to no treatment and was judged to be at high risk of performance, detection, and attrition bias. The other studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo and were generally judged to be at a mixture of low or unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting. Only one study reported the effect of treatment on visual acuity and found a similar change in visual acuity between antibiotic- and placebo-treated groups at one year. Three studies reported results for recurrent retinochoroiditis. There was a lower risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis with antibiotic treatment; similar results were seen for acute and chronic retinochoroiditis. Two studies reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in treated compared with untreated participants, and one study reported no difference; it was not possible to pool these data. Two studies found an increased risk of adverse events in treated participants.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>Different combinations were used. One RCT used pyrimethamine (200 mg/day 1, 100 mg/day 2, 50 mg/day on days 3 to 15, 25 mg/day on days 16 to 56); trisulfapyrimidine 2 g/day for 8 weeks; prednisolone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 7, 20 mg/day on days 8 to 56). Other RCT used trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole tablet (800 mg/160 mg) every 2 days for 12 months, while remaining RCTs used pyrimethamine (Daraprim) 25 mg daily for 4 weeks versus inert tablet and trimethoprim 160 mg and sulfamexacocol 800 mg, both orally every 3 days for 20 months, respectively.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Downgraded for imprecision (-1): the confidence interval was compatible with both benefit and harm and included clinically meaningful effects.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded for indirectness (-1): trial was a different design to others and evaluated antibiotic treatment after lesions had been successfully treated.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded for risk of bias (-1): in one RCT, medication was administered in an unmasked fashion, participants were followed by the clinician responsible for the trial.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded for imprecision (-2): there is very little information owing to 20 participants, and the confidence interval was very wide.</P>
