<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:36:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Catheters may be used to drain urine from the bladder in hospital for short periods of time (less than two weeks). This may cause a urinary infection, or an increase in the number of bacteria in the urine. The review found that people who had antibiotics before or during catheter use were less likely to have an infection, and less likely to have a large number of bacteria or pus cells in the urine. However, there was no evidence concerning the chance of allergic reactions or other side effects from the antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were identified in most studies but there was no definite link made to the use of antibiotics.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 31st October 2012). Additionally, we examined all reference lists of identified trials.</P>

<P>Data were independently extracted by all review authors and compared. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemtic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Where data had not been fully reported, clarification was sought directly from the authors of the trial.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-26 12:43:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six parallel-group randomised controlled trials with 789 participants met the inclusion criteria. All six trials compared antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis. Studies presented a low to unclear risk of bias with similar interventions and measured outcomes.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of bacteriuria was less common in the prophylaxis group amongst surgical patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0; risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.31) . Two non-surgical studies could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity and only one showed significantly fewer cases of bacteriuria (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37).</P>
<P>Two trials of surgical patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria only (255 participants) compared one type of antibiotic prophylaxis with another and neither study showed a significant difference in cases of bacteriuria.</P>
<P>One study (78 participants) compared antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at catheterisation only versus antibiotic prophylaxis throughout catheterisation period with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antibiotics at catheterisation only, resulted in significantly fewer cases of bacteriuria than giving prophylaxis throughout the catheterisation period (RR 0.29 95% CI 0.09 to 0.91).</P>
<P>Secondary data of pyuria were provided by two surgical studies (255 participants). When studies were pooled, pyuria occurred in significantly fewer cases in the prophylactic antibiotic group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.42). The number of gram-negative isolates in patients' urine just before catheter removal in one study (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.79) and six weeks after hospital discharge (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56) were significantly lower. There were no events in the treatment group before catheter removal. When pooled data from two studies showed significantly reduced febrile morbidity in those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 0.53 95% CI 0.31 to 0.89).</P>
<P>Although all studies assessed micro-organisms isolated from the urine specimens the data were too heterogenous to pool in a meta-analysis and have been provided in a narrative form. Further secondary data such as economic analysis, length of stay and quality of life were not covered in detail.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 12:42:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limited evidence indicated that receiving prophylactic antibiotics reduced the rate of bacteriuria and other signs of infection, such as pyuria, febrile morbidity and gram-negative isolates in patients' urine, in surgical patients who undergo bladder drainage for at least 24 hours postoperatively. There was also limited evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduced bacteriuria in non-surgical patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:36:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:36:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indwelling urinary catheters are commonly used for bladder drainage during hospital care. The most common complication is infection. Urinary tract infections account for about 35% of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections (<LINK REF="REF-Klevens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klevens 2007</LINK>) and about 80% of these are associated with urinary catheters (<LINK REF="REF-National-Audit-Office-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Audit Office 2009</LINK>). Such infections not only prolong hospital stay and are expensive to treat (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Tambyah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tambyah 2002</LINK>), but also cause unpleasant symptoms such as fever and chills in up to 30% of patients. Sometimes the infection may cause  life-threatening complications including bacteraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2009</LINK>). When used in patients who are acutely ill, the risk of a catheter-associated infection may be higher and hence pose a greater threat to life.</P>
<P>Bacteria get into the catheterised bladder by direct inoculation at the time of catheter insertion and via the following routes during catheterisation: extra-luminally by ascending from the urethral meatus along the catheter-urethral interface, and intra-luminally by reflux of the organisms into the catheter lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2001</LINK>). The normal mechanical wash-out effect of the urinary stream is interrupted when there is a urinary catheter. For this reason, micro-organisms which enter the catheterised urinary tract multiply quickly and develop difficult to remove biofilms (<LINK REF="REF-Stickler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stickler 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first step in reducing catheter-associated urinary tract infections and other complications is to avoid unnecessary catheterisation; the second is to remove the catheter as soon as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Pratt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt 2007</LINK>). Alternative methods to short-term indwelling urinary catheterisation, such as intermittent catheterisation and suprapubic catheterisation should be considered and are evaluated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ni_x00eb_l_x002d_Weise-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niël-Weise 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Once a catheter is in place, the aim is to minimise the risk of infection. There are two accepted basic principles: keeping the catheter system closed and decreasing the duration it is  in place (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2012</LINK>). Another possible strategy to reduce the risk of infection in respect to indwelling (i.e. urethral or suprapubic) catheters is to use catheters coated with an antibacterial substance. The effect of using different types of urethral catheters has been evaluated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Schumm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumm 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:36:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A further strategy of using antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial. While it is widely accepted that systemic antibiotics reduce the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in short-term catheterised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Huth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huth 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfefferkorn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfefferkorn 2009</LINK>) it is uncertain whether this protective effect offsets the risk of developing side effects from the antibiotics and the emergence of bacterial resistance. Possible ways of reducing these unwanted effects are limiting antibiotic use to patients with a positive urine culture (usually set at a pre-defined density of bacteria), or to those who have clinical symptoms (such as pain or fever), or to certain circumstances such as when first inserting and changing the catheter.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-17 12:52:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Side effects from the antibiotics and the emergence of bacterial resistance militate against prophylactic antibiotics. However, there is potential to develop optimum use of antibiotics with short-term catheters from undertaking a systematic review of the evidence.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effects of prophylactic systemic antibiotics, including addressing whether particular patient groups should receive systemic antibiotics when a short period of catheterisation is anticipated.</P>

For trials with multiple publications, only the most up-to-date or complete data for each outcome were included. Meta-analysis was undertaken where data were available from more than one study assessing the same outcome.  A fixed-effect model was used for calculations of pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals.  For categorical outcomes, we related the numbers reporting an outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to calculate a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous variables, we planned to use means and standard deviations to calculate a mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. If similar outcomes had been reported on different scales, we planned to calculate the standard mean difference (SMD). We reversed the direction of effect, if necessary to ensure consistency across trials. If data to calculate RRs were not given, we utilised the most detailed numerical data available to calculate the actual numbers or mean and standard deviations (e.g. test statistics, P values).</P>

<P>The data were analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis as far as possible, meaning that all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised. If this was not the case, we considered whether the trial should be excluded. Attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original trialists. However, if this was not possible, data were reported as given in the studies, except if there was evidence of differential loss to follow-up from the randomised groups. In that case, the use of imputation of missing data was considered. If trials reported sufficient detail to calculate mean differences but no information on associated standard deviation (SD), the outcome was assumed to have a standard deviation equal to the highest SD from other trials within the same analysis.  </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: Antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis</HEADING>
<P>All six studies compared antibiotic prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Data on bacteriuria were available for all six eligible trials. The data from six trials could not be combined in a meta-analysis because of clinical heterogeneity. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mountokalakis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mountokalakis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romanelli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Romanelli 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Wall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van der Wall 1992</LINK>). Three surgical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Wall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van der Wall 1992</LINK>) showed significantly fewer cases of bacteriuria in those patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. The trials were combined in a meta-analysis as they were judged to be sufficiently similar (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.31) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1). One surgical study (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1985</LINK>) showed significantly fewer cases of symptomatic bacteriuria/UTI in surgical patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis (RR 0.20 95% CI 0.06 to 0.66) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.1). Two non-surgical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mountokalakis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mountokalakis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romanelli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Romanelli 1990</LINK>) could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mountokalakis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mountokalakis 1985</LINK> (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.13) and <LINK REF="STD-Romanelli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Romanelli 1990</LINK> (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Organisms isolated</HEADING>
<P>Although all studies assessed micro-organisms isolated from the urine specimens, the data were too heterogenous to pool in a meta-analysis and have therefore been provided in a narrative form. Certain organisms are known to be uropathogens associated with UTI. Identifying these types in the studies helps to understand the effectiveness of the prophylaxis and its role in resistance development. In this review, a number of organisms were resistant to the trial drugs leading to prophylaxis failure.</P>
<P>Investigation by <LINK REF="STD-Britt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1977</LINK> was limited to gram-negative bacilli and/or <I>enterococci</I> and two e<I>nterococci</I> and one indole-negative <I>Proteus</I> were isolated in the antibiotic group and eight <I>E. coli</I> and one <I>Enterobacter </I>isolated in the placebo group. No data on antibiotic resistance were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2006</LINK> obtained 59 organisms from culture of the urine and distal catheter after removal (17 strains in the levofloxacin group, 22 strains in the ciprofloxacin group and 20 strains in the placebo group). The most frequently occurring bacteria were <I>Enterococcus species </I>(spp.)<I>, Staphylococcus</I> spp.<I> </I>and <I>Pseudomonas </I>spp.. Analysis was then performed on selected bacteria isolated during the study to determine their susceptibility to the trial drugs.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:57:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was broad consistency across the trials that, as might be expected, prophylactic antibiotics reduced the frequency of bacteriuria and other markers of urinary tract infection. However, the review identified few data to describe unwanted effects of prophylaxis, such as adverse drug reactions and development of antibiotic resistance.<BR/>
<BR/>Despite the frequency of urinary catheterisation, only six eligible trials were identified involving 789 participants that addressed the issue of whether or not to use antibiotics. The only measure of outcome that was consistently reported was bacteriuria; data for other outcomes were either not reported or available for single trials only. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1985</LINK>) defined the primary outcome of urinary tract infection involving bacteriuria accompanied by urinary symptoms (including febrile morbidity).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:58:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Definitions now widely used for surveillance purposes for the diagnosis of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) include primarily symptoms e.g. dysuria, frequency, fever, supra pubic tenderness, bacteriuria <B>and</B> at least one other criteria. In asymptomatic UTI the definition is bacteriuria <B>and</B> a positive blood culture. There must be at least one matching uropathogen micro-organism to the urine culture, or at least two matching blood cultures drawn on separate occasions if the matching pathogen is a common skin commensal (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2008</LINK>). Using bacteriuria alone as a criteria for diagnosing UTI is limiting and may lead to unnecessary antibiotic therapy in catheterised patients. Although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1977</LINK>) included taking blood cultures as part of their protocol in those with fever, the results of any pathogens isolated were not reported and so their relationship to the bacteriuria is unknown. All but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mountokalakis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mountokalakis 1985</LINK>), were placebo-controlled and appear to have been satisfactorily performed. The trials involved two broad groups: post-surgical (non-urological) and non-surgical patients. The trials also varied in the antibiotic used for prophylaxis and in the frequency with which the antibiotics were administered. However, given the general consistency of the results, this variation enhances the generalisability of the review findings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of bacteria</HEADING>
<P>There were variations in protocols between the trials in the organisms tested for and reported on. Four trials cultured and reported on all bacteria isolated (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mountokalakis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mountokalakis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romanelli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Romanelli 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Wall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van der Wall 1992</LINK>), one cultured all then selected a number of bacteria isolated during the study for further analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2006</LINK>). One trial identified gram-negative bacteria and/or <I>Enteroccoci</I> only<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1977</LINK>), therefore, reporting only on organisms most likely to represent uropathogens that are commonly associated with UTI .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Resistance to antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>A major concern with employing prophylactic antibiotics is the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and antibiotic prophylaxis has come in for particular scrutiny because it involves treating those who are asymptomatic. Over-prescribing and unnecessary use of antibiotics increases the chance of resistance developing as seen with Methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> which is now endemic in acute healthcare settings. <I>Clostridium difficile</I> is also linked to over-prescribing and particular groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (especially ciprofloxacin). Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms include a range of common uropathogenic bacteria which have also developed resistance to cephalosporins. As a result of increasing resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, prescription of these antibiotic groups are now being restricted.</P>
<P>One trial used cefazolin but did not report on resistance (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1977</LINK>). Two trials used ciprofloxacin (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Wall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van der Wall 1992</LINK>) one (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Wall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van der Wall 1992</LINK>) reporting significant resistance to the trial drug in both intervention groups. The other trial reported that the selected bacteria analysed were sensitive to the trial drug but this trial only analysed 11 out of the 59 organisms obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2006</LINK>). Increasing resistance of common uropathogens to ampicillin has also seen an increase in first treatment failure requiring the prescription of second line courses of antibiotics for UTI. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mountokalakis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mountokalakis 1985</LINK>) identified ampicillin-resistant organisms in all groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Another concern about antibiotic prophylaxis is the possibility of an allergic adverse drug reaction. None of the reports provided any information about this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alternative strategies</HEADING>
<P>One possible approach to limiting the use of prophylactic antibiotics is through serial urine culture, with antibiotic treatment if asymptomatic bacteriuria is identified and infection is diagnosed according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition above (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2008</LINK>). Another approach is to limit the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to patients who are at high risk for complications of UTI, for example, patients with implants, immunosuppression or diabetes. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Romanelli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Romanelli 1990</LINK>) reported results for diabetics and non-diabetics but no trial identified serial urine cultures or selection criteria for high risk groups to limit antibiotic use.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-07 12:32:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Weak evidence suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis compared to giving antibiotics when microbiologically indicated reduced the rate of bacteriuria in surgical patients with a urinary catheter for 24 hours. Limited evidence indicated that receiving antibiotics for the first three postoperative days or from postoperative day two until catheter removal reduced the rate of bacteriuria and other signs of infection, such as pyuria, febrile morbidity and gram-negative isolates in patients' urine in surgical patients undergoing bladder drainage for at least 24 hours postoperatively. There was also limited evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduced bacteriuria in non-surgical patients.</P>
<P>Because of the limited evidence and the few data on adverse effects and development of antibiotic resistance, the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:58:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More randomised controlled trials are needed, especially for the comparison of giving antibiotics if microbiologically indicated versus treating with antibiotics if clinically indicated. The antibiotics selected for prophylaxis should be those that do not increase the risk of multi-resistance development or be likely to cause complications of treatment such as <I>Clostridium difficile</I>. Patients who are at high risk for complications of urinary tract infection should particularly be included.</P>
<P>Consistency in reporting for the period a patient will be catheterised, type and dose of antibiotics and the point in time bacteriuria will be measured would strengthen research policies. Urinary tract infection should be defined according to standardised definitions for catheterised patients rather than bacteriuria alone. Trials should be sufficiently powered to enable subgroup analysis in general surgical patients, urological or gynaecological surgery patients and non-surgical patients.</P>
