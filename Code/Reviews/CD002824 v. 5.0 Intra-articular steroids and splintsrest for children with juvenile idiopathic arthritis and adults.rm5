<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Intra-articular steroids and splints/rest for arthritis in children and adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>
<B>Do intra-articular steroid injections work for treating rheumatoid arthritis and should people rest after the injections? <BR/>
</B>Seven moderate quality studies were reviewed and provide the best evidence we have today. The studies tested 346 adults with rheumatoid arthritis. They compared people who had a steroid injection, a fake injection or aspiration/washout of their knees or wrists to each other. Two studies tested whether people should rest their joints after injections.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>What is rheumatoid arthritis and how might steroid injections help?</B>
</P>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissues. The attack happens mostly in the joints of the hands and feet and causes redness, pain, swelling and heat around the joints. Intra-articular steroid injections into a joint can be used to decrease pain and swelling quickly. People may have steroid injections to delay starting steroid pills or arthritis drugs, or when drugs are not controlling pain enough. It is not clear if steroid injections work and if people should rest their joints after injections.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the studies show?</B>
</P>
<P>One of two studies show that people who had steroid injections had less pain the first day than people who had fake injections. </P>
<P>Pain decreased by about 15 points on a 0-100 scale with a steroid injection and 7 points with a fake injection.</P>
<P>The change in pain, however, was the same after 1 or 7 to 12 weeks with or without steroid injections.</P>
<P>Studies show that people who had steroid injections could bend and straighten their leg better/farther and had less swelling around their knee than people with fake injections. Morning stiffness also did not last as long with steroid injections. But one study shows that people could walk faster with steroid injections while another study shows they could not.</P>
<P>People had less pain, stiffness, swelling, and could walk faster if they rested their knees after steroid injections to their knees. But after steroid injections to their wrists, people felt the same whether they rested their wrists or not - but more had a relapse when they rested.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>How safe are steroid injections?</B>
<BR/>No side effects due to injections were reported. </P>
<P>
<B>What is the bottom line? </B>
<BR/>The level of quality of the evidence is 'silver'. Intra-articular steroid injections can improve pain, movement, stiffness and swelling and are safe in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is no evidence to say whether this is true for children. </P>
<P>Knees should be rested after a steroid injection, but wrists should not. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Resting or immobilizing a joint to enhance outcomes following intra-articular (IA) steroid injection is generally advocated. This systematic review aimed to determine the efficacy of IA steroid injections and the influence of post-injection rest. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. Compare IA steroid injections versus no treatment or placebo. <BR/>2. Determine the effects of rest following IA steroid injection in rheumatoid or juvenile idiopathic arthritis. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL- Issue 4, 2003), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR - Issue 4, 2003), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE - searched 8.1.04), MEDLINE (1966 to August Week 2 2004), EMBASE (1980 to August Week 2 2004) , CINAHL (1982 to December Week 2 2003), Clinical Trials site of the National Institute of Health, (USA - searched 8.1.04), OTseeker (Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence - searched 8.1.04) and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database - searched 8.1.04) were searched. Journals and reference lists were hand searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Eligible were randomised controlled trials of IA steroid injections or of rest following IA steroid injections in rheumatoid or juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Potentially relevant references were evaluated and all data extracted by two independent reviewers. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five trials (n=346) examining IA steroid injection in the knee joint were included. It was not possible to pool data as outcome measures, timing of follow up and the methods of data reporting differed between trials. There was inconclusive conflicting evidence from two trials that walking time was reduced. There was evidence from one moderate quality trial that pain was reduced at 1-day post-injection (0-100 VAS from 28.33 to 13.46; McGill Pain Scale from 8.89 to 3.96) but not at 1 week or 7-12 weeks post-injection. There is some evidence that IA injections improved knee flexion (by 14 degrees) and reduced knee extension lag (by 20 degrees), knee circumference (median reduction = 0.3 cm) and morning stiffness (reduced from 60 mins to 7.6 mins). One trial (n=91) examined the effects of rest following injection in the knee. The rested group achieved significant improvement in pain, stiffness, knee circumference, and walking time when compared with the non-rested group (no point estimates provided). One trial evaluated rest following injection of the wrist (n=117). Relapse rate was higher in the rested group (rest relapse rate = 24/58, no-rest group = 14/59); but there were no differences between the rested and non-rested groups on pain, joint circumference, wrist function, grip strength or ROM. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is some evidence to support the use of IA steroid injections and resting a knee following injections but that wrists should not be rested following injections. The included studies involved adult participants so any conclusions can only cautiously applied to children. Further research is required to examine the use and type of rest and the differential responses of different joints following injections. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-03 10:31:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease characterised by swelling, inflammation or limitation of movement in at least one joint, with pain, heat and/or tenderness in the affected joints. Loss of function may accompany arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic arthritis of unknown origin that begins before age 16 and persists at least six weeks to three months (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Intra-articular (IA) steroid injections are accepted practice in the clinical management of both adults and children with arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 1998</LINK>). IA injections were the second most common therapy (after non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) used by Canadian and US pediatric rheumatologists in managing pauci-articular (oligoarthritis) JIA (<LINK REF="REF-Cron-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cron 1999</LINK>). IA injections are used to provide local, immediate anti-inflammatory effects to the injected joint (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2003</LINK>). The joint capsule is entered with a needle and the corticosteroid is injected. Fluid may be aspirated out of the joint prior to injection (arthrocentesis) as there is some evidence that this procedure reduces the risk of relapse following injection (<LINK REF="REF-Weitoft-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitoft 2000</LINK>). IA steroid injections are used as first line agents when, for example, only one or two joints are affected by arthritis and/or to prevent or delay the need for oral steroids or other systemic drugs such as methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dent-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-See-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">See 1998</LINK>). IA steroid injections can also provide relief whilst awaiting the onset of disease modifying drugs. In addition, IA steroid injections may be used as second line therapy to manage joints with a poor response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although IA steroid injections are widely used in the clinical management of children and adults with arthritis, the evidence for the efficacy of IA steroid injections has not yet been systematically reviewed. There are several retrospective audits and pre-post design studies examining the outcome of IA steroid injections (e.g.. <LINK REF="REF-Allen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hertzberger_x002d_ten-Cate" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertzberger-ten Cate</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1951</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Huppertz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huppertz 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lepore-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepore 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Neidel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Neidel 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Padeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padeh 1998</LINK>). These studies report positive outcomes of injections with few, if any, adverse events. For instance <LINK REF="REF-Allen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1986</LINK> injected 49 knees in children and reported that 50% of children had maintained a good response at one year. <LINK REF="REF-Huppertz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huppertz 1995</LINK> injected various joints of 21 children and reported that all the joints improved at seven weeks on MRI. <LINK REF="REF-Padeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padeh 1998</LINK> injected a mix of joints in 71 children and reported that 82% of joints remained in remission at six months. Similarly <LINK REF="REF-Hertzberger_x002d_ten-Cate" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertzberger-ten Cate</LINK> reported 70% remission at six months in 21 injected knees and <LINK REF="STD-Neidel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Neidel 2002</LINK> reported a 58% remission rate at two years from 67 injected hips. </P>
<P>Resting or immobilizing a joint to enhance outcomes following IA steroid injection is advocated by a number of authors. The rationale for resting a joint includes: <BR/>1. Reducing the amount of steroid diffusion out of the joint (<LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1995</LINK>), thus allowing time for repair of inflamed tissue (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1995</LINK>) and minimising any effects of the steroid in other parts of the body (systemic effects) (<LINK REF="REF-Neustadt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neustadt 1985</LINK>). <BR/>2. Minimising the leakage of steroid back through the track the needle makes as it enters the joint (needle track) (<LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1995</LINK>). <BR/>3. Preventing people who may receive immediate pain relief from the injections from over-using joints (<LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Rest may be achieved through bedrest, reduced activity levels or splinting. The nature of the rest and the period for which it is imposed varies greatly amongst those recommending it. A survey of British rheumatologists (<LINK REF="REF-Haslock-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslock 1995</LINK>) reported that "most" respondents advised rest or reduced use of injected weight bearing joints for periods of between 12 to 24 hours post-injection and that admission for bedrest was practiced by nearly 14% of respondents. Bedrest regimens include 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK>) or 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1989</LINK>) of bed rest in hospital, and three days of bedrest followed by three weeks of reduced activity (<LINK REF="REF-Neustadt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neustadt 1985</LINK>). Avoiding activity including weight bearing for 24 hours has been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Honkanen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honkanen 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Padeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padeh 1998</LINK>), as has full time splint use for 48 to 72 hours following injections (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie1997</LINK>). A longer three-week period of either splinting to immobilise wrists and fingers or restricted use for other upper limb joints and six weeks of restricted use for the lower limb has also been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1995</LINK>). In contrast some researchers advise IA steroid injection recipients to pursue their usual activities following injections (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1951</LINK>) and others make no mention of rest or splints as part of the IA steroid injection management (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bird-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hertzberger_x002d_ten-Cate" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertzberger-ten Cate</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Huppertz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huppertz 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>There are, therefore, few controlled studies of intra-articular injections and of resting or splinting joints following injections. This systematic review of RCTs is being undertaken to determine whether intra-articular steroid injections result in better outcomes than no treatment or placebo and whether splints/rest influence outcome. As the impetus for this review arose in a children's hospital we proposed to review the efficacy of IA steroid injections and resting post-injections in children with arthritis. A preliminary search of the literature, however, revealed no RCTs of children with arthritis so this systematic review was broadened to include RCTs of adults with rheumatoid arthritis with the intention of generalising, where appropriate, to children. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To assess the effectiveness and safety of intra-articular steroid injections compared to no treatment or placebo in people with rheumatoid or JIA. [Note that placebo includes injection of saline, joint washout or aspiration. Joint washout involves aspirating synovial fluid, then injecting saline and aspirating it out of the joints one or more times to remove intra-articular debris (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 1987</LINK>)] <BR/>2. To assess whether resting a joint, including using splints, immediately following intra-articular steroid injections in people with rheumatoid or JIA contributes to an improved outcome compared to IA steroid injection without rest.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR - Issue 4, 2003) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE - searched 8.1.04) were searched to identify any relevant systematic reviews.</P>
<P>The Clinical Trials site of the National Institute of Health, (USA - searched 8.1.04), PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database - searched 8.1.04), OTseeker (Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence - searched 8.1.04) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL- Issue 4, 2003) were searched for trials.</P>
<P>MEDLINE (1966 to August Week 2 2004), EMBASE (1980 to August Week 2 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to December Week 2 2003) were also searched for clinical trials. The Topic search strategy is shown in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and is based on the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group strategy. This strategy was used to search MEDLINE, together with a standard randomised controlled trial filter, and adapted appropriately for other databases.</P>
<P>Non-English language articles were eligible for selection to reduce the risk of publication bias.</P>
<P>The reference lists of relevant studies were searched for further identification of published work, conference presentations and personal communication.</P>
<P>The following rheumatology journals were hand searched for studies and conference proceedings</P>
<P>· Arthritis and Rheumatism (searched to Volume 48(12) 2003)<BR/>· Journal of Rheumatology (searched to Volume 30(8) 2003)<BR/>· Rheumatology (formerly British Journal of Rheumatology; searched to 42(12) 2003)<BR/>· Arthritis Care and Research (searched to 49(5) 2003)</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Selection of studies <BR/>This review was preceded by a peer reviewed published a priori protocol.<BR/>The above search strategy identified a set of potentially relevant references (title/abstracts). Full articles were obtained where a judgement about the suitability of inclusion could not be made from the title/abstract or when consensus could not be reached. Potentially suitable references were then assessed independently by two reviewers (MW, DG) according to the selection criteria to determine which ones were eligible for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. A standard data extraction form was devised and piloted. Data were extracted independently by the two reviewers (MW, DG) who then met to compare the data. Any differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus. If data were missing or further information was required, reasonable attempts were made to contact the authors to request required information. </P>
<P>In addition to extracting data the reviewers independently allocated each included trial into one of three quality categories, based on those described in the Cochrane Reviewers' handbook version 4.0 (section 6.7.1, page 39):<BR/>· Category A: Low risk of bias - plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results - All the criteria met<BR/>· Category B: Moderate risk of bias - plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results - One or more criteria met<BR/>· Category C: High risk of bias - plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results - One or more criteria not met</P>
<P>The criteria for assessment were: random allocation, allocation concealment, blinding, accounting for withdrawals and dropout rate<BR/>Differences in the reviewers allocation of studies into quality categories were resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>Data Analysis: <BR/>Where possible weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous outcomes and dichotomous outcomes were analyzed using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Meta-analysis was planned if similar outcomes were available in clinically similar populations (e.g. diagnostic groups, joints injected) and measured at similar time points post-injections. Data for different joints were analysed separately. Significance for statistical heterogeneity was set at 0.10, using a chi square analysis.</P>
<P>Following review of all identified studies, however, there were no included studies where data for common outcomes measures collected at similar points in time and for the same joints (e.g. knees or wrists) could be pooled in a meta-analysis. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was planned to determine whether trials allocated to Category C should be included in the data analysis but this was not possible as no data from any of the studies could be pooled. </P>
<P>As studies reported data collected at different times post-injection it was decided to present data in time intervals; these were 1 day, 1 week, 2 to 6 weeks, 7 to 11 weeks, and 12 to 24 weeks. These time intervals were selected post-hoc and were intended to represent clinically meaningful time frames.</P>
<P>Grading of evidence <BR/>We used the grading system described in the 2004 book Evidence-based Rheumatology (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>) and recommended by the Musculoskeletal Group:</P>
<P>Platinum: A published systematic review that has at least two individual controlled trials each satisfying the following : <BR/>·Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. <BR/>·Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. <BR/>·Handling of withdrawals &gt;80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) are acceptable). <BR/>·Concealment of treatment allocation. </P>
<P>Gold: At least one randomised clinical trial meeting all of the following criteria for the major outcome(s) as reported: <BR/>·Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. <BR/>·Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. <BR/>·Handling of withdrawals &gt; 80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as LOCF are acceptable). <BR/>·Concealment of treatment allocation. </P>
<P>Silver: A systematic review or randomised trial that does not meet the above criteria. Silver ranking would also include evidence from at least one study of non-randomised cohorts that did and did not receive the therapy, or evidence from at least one high quality case-control study. A randomised trial with a 'head-to-head' comparison of agents would be considered silver level ranking unless a reference were provided to a comparison of one of the agents to placebo showing at least a 20% relative difference. </P>
<P>Bronze: The bronze ranking is given to evidence if at least one high quality case series without controls (including simple before/after studies in which patients act as their own control) or if the conclusion is derived from expert opinion based on clinical experience without reference to any of the foregoing (for example, argument from physiology, bench research or first principles). </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Initially, 15 studies were identified from the literature search. Eight of these studies were excluded - see Table of Excluded Studies. Following is a brief description of the seven remaining studies (see Table of Included Studies). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1958</LINK> completed a double-blind crossover trial of 24 adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty-seven knees from these participants were injected with hydrocortisone acetate, hydrocortisone tertiary butyl acetate or placebo. Outcomes measured included walking time, ROM and pain, measured at fortnightly intervals during the follow up period. Significance levels for the differences between groups, but not point estimates or variances, were reported in the paper. As the authors have not been able to be contacted (see Table of Included Studies) there is no information which can be used in a meta-analysis. The results of this study, therefore, will be discussed descriptively in the Results section.<BR/> <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Grewin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Grewin 1988</LINK> and colleagues studied 73 participants with arthritis of the knee who were randomised to receive 80 mg methylprednisolone acetate, 20 mg or 40 mg triamcinolone hexacetonide or placebo. The outcome measures included joint index and duration of efficacy. <LINK REF="STD-Grewin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Grewin 1988</LINK> published the work in abstract form and the authors have not been able to be contacted for details of the study or results (see Table of Included Studies). Thus, only mean values (no variance) for duration of efficacy and statistical difference between groups for joint index are available for inclusion in a descriptive discussion. Methodological quality is unable to be assessed as insufficient information is provided in the abstract.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 1987</LINK> randomly allocated 60 participants with active synovitis of the knee into three groups: Group 1 - aspiration and triamcinolone; Group 2 - aspiration and washout; Group 3 - aspiration, triamcinolone and washout. The groups appropriate for comparison are Groups 2 and 3. Median and range data, which are inappropriate to include in a meta-analysis, were reported for the outcomes of pain, morning stiffness, joint circumference, walking time and ROM. This paper has been designated as having a moderate risk of bias and the data will be discussed descriptively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1999</LINK> carried out an RCT where 52 participants with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n=24) or osteoarthritis (OA) (n=28) were randomly allocated to receive intra-articular morphine, dexamethasone or placebo injection to the knee. The study reported no significant difference between the RA and OA groups on the outcomes therefore these data were not reported separately for each patient group in the published paper. Outcomes were pain VAS and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Data (means and standard deviations) were reported hourly for six hours and daily for six days. Only the data from hour six (Day 1) and day six (one week) are used in this review as these were the data points closer to the time frames selected. This paper is designated as having a moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Vliet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van Vliet 1987</LINK> and colleagues randomised 137 participants with rheumatoid arthritis to receive 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg Rimexolone (Vexol) or a placebo injection to the knee. Follow up was at one week, one, two and three months and the outcomes included knee circumference and knee flexion. A number of other outcomes were measured but they were developed for the study and do not have established psychometric properties (see Table of Included Studies). Means and standard deviations for these outcomes were available however, these data could not be pooled with data from any other study. This study was designated as having a moderate risk of bias due to a large drop-out rate of 40% by the three month follow up (drop out rate at one week = 5%, one month = 12%, two months = 32%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK> was one of only two included studies to investigate the effects of rest following IA injections (triamcinolone hexacetide). Ninety-four participants with arthritis in the knee were randomised to receive an injection only or injection plus 24 hours of strict, non-weight bearing rest (bedrest). The outcomes were pain, stiffness, knee circumference and walking time measured at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The median and interquartile range of the area under the response curve for each outcome measure were reported, therefore, these data could not be used in a meta-analysis. This paper is designated as having a moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weitoft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weitoft 2003</LINK> evaluated the effects of 48 hours of rest using an elastic wrist orthoses following IA injections in 117 participants with RA of the wrist. The primary outcome was relapse of synovitis; the secondary outcomes were pain, wrist extension, joint circumference, wrist function and grip strength. All data are available for meta-analysis although with no other studies of wrists, there is no capacity to pool data. This study is designated as having a moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>In summary, of the seven included studies, five compared IA steroids to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1958</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Grewin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Grewin 1988</LINK> did not include data which could be entered into a meta-analysis and <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 1987</LINK> reported median and range data which could not be included in a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Vliet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van Vliet 1987</LINK> provided detailed results which are useful for quantitative analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK> was the only included study to compare rested and non-rested knees following injections but this paper did not report data which could be used in a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Weitoft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weitoft 2003</LINK>'s study of rest following injection provided data for analysis.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis is a synthesis of RCTs of IA steroid injections versus placebo or no treatment, and RCTs of resting a joint following injections. </P>
<P>Five RCTs which addressed the effectiveness of IA injections over placebo were identified, all of which studied adults with arthritis. Overall, there is some evidence that injections improve pain (at one day), knee flexion and extension lag (up to 7 to 12 weeks), knee circumference (up to 2 to 6 weeks), morning stiffness (up to 7 to 12 weeks) and duration of efficacy (11.4 to 22.3 weeks in the steroid-treated groups vs 1 week in the placebo control group). The evidence in support of the effectiveness of IA on walking time is inconclusive. There is also some suggestion that the effectiveness of IA steroid may be dose-related. There were no reported adverse events related to the injections in recent studies. In summary, there is weak RCT evidence in support of IA steroid injections in managing adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is no evidence of harm so it is appropriate that IA steroid injections continue to be used and to be properly evaluated. It is important to note that all the included studies evaluated the outcomes of injected knees. The impact of IA steroid injections on other joints can only be extrapolated and requires investigation. </P>
<P>Resting a joint following injections is an imposition for the patient and, depending on the method used (e.g. hospitalisation, splints), the health system. The efficacy of rest needs to be evaluated in order for rest to be used confidently as part of IA steroid management in arthritis. One RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK>) investigating rest versus no rest following IA injection in the knee was located. Results for pain, stiffness, knee circumference and walking time indicated that rest is effective in enhancing the outcomes of IA steroid injections. Conversely, a second RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Weitoft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weitoft 2003</LINK>) reported no difference in the relapse rate between a rested and non-rested group following injections to the wrist. Further analysis of the relapse rate in Metaview suggests that the relapse rate of wrist synovitis was actually greater in the rest group. There is some evidence, therefore, to support the use of rest following IA injections in the knee, but further research is required. Resting the wrist joint ,however, following injection appears unnecessary and may even cause harm.</P>
<P>The reason for the discrepancy in results for resting knees versus wrists following IA injections is not clear. Both studies are designated as having moderate risk of bias and use reliable outcome measures, so methodological quality is not likely to be responsible for the differences. Although <LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK> does not report sufficient data to allow analysis in Metaview, the results indicate that rest enhances outcomes for knees following IA injections. <LINK REF="STD-Weitoft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weitoft 2003</LINK> proposes the following reasons why the results of his trial differ from those of <LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK>: i) absorption of corticosteroid may be increased by weightbearing and, as a non-weight-bearing joint, the wrist does not require resting; ii) the smaller area of inflamed synovium in the wrist means that less corticosteroid is absorbed and immobilisation may be of minor importance; or iii) wrist movement may be necessary to spread the corticosteroid around the wrist joint complex and tendon sheaths so rest may inhibit this process. A further possibility is that the elastic wrist orthosis used by <LINK REF="STD-Weitoft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weitoft 2003</LINK> does not immobilise the wrist sufficiently to be effective.</P>
<P>There are many questions which remain unanswered regarding rest and IA steroid injections. The <LINK REF="STD-Chakravarty-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravarty 1994</LINK> study described the effectiveness of 24 hours of inpatient bedrest following injections, <LINK REF="STD-Weitoft-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weitoft 2003</LINK> used 48 hours of elastic wrist orthosis. As well as replicating these studies, further research is required to evaluate the effects of other means of rest (such as rigid splints and casts) and of rest on other joints such as hips, ankles and finger joints. In addition, more work is needed to determine the length of rest that is most effective in enhancing the outcomes of IA steroid injections. Finally, the issue of IA injections and rest in children with JIA has not been studied in clinical trials. Any conclusion drawn from the adult literature must be carefully considered before being extrapolated to children with JIA.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is:<BR/>"silver" level evidence for the efficacy of IA injections in managing rheumatoid arthritis<BR/>"silver" level evidence that resting knee joints after IA injections is beneficial and <BR/>"silver" level evidence that wrists should not be rested after IA injections.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>IA steroid injections are commonly accepted practice in the management of rheumatoid and JIA (<LINK REF="REF-Haslock-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslock 1995</LINK>). This systematic review of RCTs in the area provides some evidence for IA steroid injections and for resting knees following injections in adults. This review concludes that resting wrist joints may not be required and may be harmful. Further research is required to confirm the place of IA injections in the management of arthritis and the use of rest following injections in adults and especially in children. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The evidence surrounding the efficacy of IA injections and the impact of rest following injections is drawn from a small numbers of studies with small numbers of participants. The studies of IA injection efficacy lacked uniformity of outcome measures and follow up periods which limited the ability to pool data in a meta-analysis. Large and rigorous RCT's are required to further investigate the role of IA steroid injections in effecting meaningful change for people with rheumatoid arthritis and in children with JIA. The need for rest following injections, as well as the optimum type and duration of rest, also requires exploration. </P>
