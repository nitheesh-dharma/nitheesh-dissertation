<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-16 12:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. People with pain are used to test painkillers. They have often had wisdom teeth removed. The pain is often treated with pain killers taken by mouth. Results can be applied to other forms of acute pain.</P>
<P>A series of reviews looks at how good painkillers are. This review looks at a drug called etoricoxib. This is one of a type of pain killer called an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). The amount of pain relief experienced depends on the dose taken.</P>
<P>We found six clinical trials with 1214 people. A single 120 mg dose of etoricoxib produced useful pain relief in 7 in 10 (66%) people with moderate or severe pain, compared with just over 1 in 10 (12%) with placebo. A single 90 mg dose produced similar results in one large trial. Pain relief lasted for 20 hours in half of people treated.</P>
<P>Adverse events occurred at similar rates with etoricoxib and placebo in these single-dose studies. No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events occurred with etoricoxib.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review, assessed quality, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants prescribed etoricoxib or placebo with at least 50% pain relief over six hours, using validated equations. We calculated relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse events.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-16 14:31:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified no new studies for this updated review, which includes six studies with 1214 participants in comparisons of etoricoxib with placebo. All six studies reported on the 120 mg dose (798 participants in a comparison with placebo). Sixty-six per cent of participants with etoricoxib 120 mg and 12% with placebo reported at least 50% pain relief (NNT 1.8 (1.7 to 2.0); high-quality evidence). For dental studies only, the NNT was 1.6 (1.5 to 1.8). A single dose of 90 mg produced similar results in one large trial. Other doses (60, 180, and 240 mg) were each studied in only one treatment arm.</P>
<P>Significantly fewer participants used rescue medication over 24 hours when taking etoricoxib 120 mg than placebo (NNT to prevent remedication 2.2 (1.9 to 2.8)), and the median time to use of rescue medication was 20 hours for etoricoxib and two hours for placebo. Adverse events were reported at a similar rate to placebo (moderate-quality evidence), with no serious events.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:00:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review, 'Single dose oral etoricoxib for acute postoperative pain in adults', first published in Issue 2, 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>), and updated in Issue 4, 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2012</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-03 10:25:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care. The aim of this series of reviews is to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level. The series includes well-established analgesics such as paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), naproxen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009a</LINK>), diclofenac (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009b</LINK>), and ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009c</LINK>), and newer cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective analgesics, such as celecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>) and lumiracoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2010</LINK>). An overview brings together the results from all the individual drug reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants are small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double-blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following four to six hours for shorter-acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer-acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Knowing the relative efficacy of different analgesic drugs at various doses can be helpful. Results from completed reviews of many different analgesics have been brought together to facilitate (indirect) comparisons in an overview (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>), and analgesics relevant for dentistry are discussed in <LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2011</LINK>.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-16 12:59:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors or 'coxibs') were developed to address the problem of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). Etoricoxib (sold worldwide under the brand name of Arcoxia, and in Italy as Algix and Tauxib) is one of the second generation of coxibs and is used to treat pain in chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and low back pain, and also in acute pain and gout. It is available by prescription only as 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, and 120 mg tablets in many parts of the world, but is not licensed for use in the US, due to concerns about safety. In chronic conditions the daily dose is usually 30 mg to 90 mg once daily, and in acute conditions 90 or 120 mg once daily (for up to a week). In primary care in England in 2012, there were almost 50,000 prescriptions for the 120 mg dose, and about 150,000 each for the 60 mg and 90 mg doses (<LINK REF="REF-PACT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">PACT 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard licensed dose of etoricoxib for acute pain is 120 mg in most countries, but a lower dose of 90 mg may be recommended in others.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:00:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NSAIDs have pain-relieving, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties, and are thought to relieve pain by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases and thus the production of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Prostaglandins occur throughout body tissues and fluids and act to stimulate pain nerve endings and promote/inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Cyclo-oxygenase has at least two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutive while COX-2 is induced at sites of inflammation and produces the prostaglandins involved in inflammatory responses and pain mediation (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). Unlike traditional NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and ketoprofen, the coxibs are selective inhibitors, blocking primarily the action of COX-2, providing pain relief, and causing fewer gastrointestinal effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005b</LINK>). In addition, they should not precipitate bleeding events through inhibition of platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2005</LINK>). Etoricoxib is more highly selective of COX-2 over COX-1 than celecoxib.</P>
<P>In common with other NSAIDS, COX-2 inhibitors can give rise to fluid retention and renal damage (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2002</LINK>), so particular caution is needed in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). COX-2 inhibitors have been implicated in increased cardiovascular problems in long-term use, but this is complicated by differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 2009</LINK>). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that prior cardiac damage may be a more important trigger than any particular drug or class of drug (<LINK REF="REF-Ruff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruff 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-16 12:59:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Etoricoxib is one of a small group of COX-2 selective NSAIDs that provide pain relief with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than traditional NSAIDs. This update is important because at licensed doses etoricoxib is one of the more effective and longest lasting analgesics in acute pain.</P>

<P>We followed QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used the number of participants randomised to each treatment group who took the study medication. We planned analyses for different doses.</P>
<P>For each study we converted the mean TOTPAR, SPID, VAS TOTPAR, or VAS SPID (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>) values for active and placebo to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>), and calculated the proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). We then converted these proportions into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. We used this information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active and placebo to calculate relative benefit or relative risk, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT).</P>
<P>We accepted the following pain measures for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to 'none, slight, moderate, good or complete';</LI>

<P>Searches for the original review in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>) identified seven potentially relevant studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>All the dental studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2005</LINK>) reported the number of participants with one or more adverse event for each treatment arm, although the time over which the information was collected varied between trials, from six hours to 14 days. It was unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2004</LINK>) whether the adverse event reports covered the duration of the trial (24 hours), or whether they included any adverse events occurring between the end of the trial and a follow-up visit some days later. <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2005</LINK>, the orthopaedic study, did not provide any single dose data for adverse events (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>For all doses combined there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event with etoricoxib (32%, 272/839) and placebo (36%, 79/220), giving a relative risk of 0.91 (0.74 to 1.1) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). There was again no significant difference for the 120 mg dose alone, with 33% (140/423) experiencing adverse events with etoricoxib, and 36% (79/220) with placebo, giving a relative risk of 0.93 (0.74 to 1.2) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events were generally described as mild to moderate in severity. There were no serious adverse events reported for etoricoxib. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2004b</LINK>) reported one serious adverse event in the sodium naproxen 550 mg treatment arm. This event, multiple fractures after a car accident, was reported 12 days after the study drug was taken and judged to be unrelated to the study medication.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>We classified participants who took rescue medication as withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, which we reported under 'Use of rescue medication' above. Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy were uncommon and usually due to protocol violations.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:45:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for this updated review, providing information for both efficacy and harm for doses of etoricoxib ranging from 60 mg to 240 mg, although only the 120 mg dose provided sufficient data for a pooled analysis of any outcome. Sixty-six per cent of those taking a single 120 mg dose of etoricoxib experienced the clinically useful primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief, compared with about 12% of those taking placebo. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for at least 50% pain relief was 1.8 (1.7 to 2.0), meaning that almost one in two participants treated with etoricoxib 120 mg experienced this level of pain relief who would not have done so if treated with placebo. Limited data from one study in orthopaedic pain following initial patient-controlled analgesia and appropriate washout, suggest that it is also effective in this situation, but less so. There were insufficient data to demonstrate a dose response.</P>
<P>Indirect comparisons of NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours in reviews of other analgesics using identical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>) indicate that etoricoxib 120 mg has:</P>
<UL>
<LI>equivalent efficacy to soluble ibuprofen 400 mg (NNT 1.8 (1.7 to 2.0), naproxen 500/550 mg (NNT 1.8 (1.6 to 2.1)), and diclofenac potassium 100 mg (NNT 1.9 (1.7 to 2.2));</LI>
<LI>slightly better efficacy than standard ibuprofen 400 mg (NNT 2.3 (2.2 to 2.5)) and celecoxib 400 mg (NNT 2.5 (2.2 to 2.9)); and</LI>
<LI>much better efficacy than aspirin 1000 mg (NNT 4.2 (3.2 to 6.0)), diclofenac sodium 100 mg (NNT 4.5 (3.2 to 7.6)), and paracetamol 1000 mg (NNT 3.2 (2.9 to 3.6)).</LI>
</UL>
<P>It has been suggested that data on the use of rescue medication, whether as a proportion of participants requiring it or the median time to its use, might be helpful in assessing the usefulness of an analgesic, and possibly distinguishing between different doses (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>). In this review only about half of participants treated with etoricoxib 120 mg following dental surgery required rescue medication within 24 hours, compared to nearly all those treated with placebo. Indirect comparisons with other analgesics for duration of action (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>) indicate that etoricoxib 120 mg has a longer duration of action than celecoxib 400 mg (8.4 hours) and commonly used traditional NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen 400 mg (5.4 hours), diclofenac 100 mg (4.9 hours), and naproxen 500 mg (8.9 hours). Longer duration of action may be advantageous in some circumstances. In a postoperative setting, where patients may feel nauseated, a longer time before remedication is needed may be of benefit to the patient, and it may also reduce demands on time for nursing staff. There were insufficient data to examine the effect of dose on duration of action.</P>
<P>Reporting of data for adverse events, withdrawals (other than lack of efficacy), or exclusions, and handling of missing data was better in these recent studies than in many older reports of single-dose analgesics. Poor reporting of adverse events in acute pain trials has been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). The method of reporting adverse events (usually specified as 'spontaneous') was not explicit (e.g. patient diary, recall at follow-up visit) and they were collected over different periods of time. This almost certainly included periods after the use of rescue medication, which may cause its own adverse events. The usefulness of single dose studies for assessing adverse events is questionable, but it is nonetheless reassuring that in these studies there was no difference between etoricoxib (at any dose) and placebo for occurrence of any adverse event, and there were no serious adverse events or adverse event withdrawals. Long-term, multiple-dose studies should be used for meaningful analysis of adverse events since, even in acute pain settings, analgesics are likely to be used in multiple doses.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:44:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included studies reported useful data for both primary and secondary outcomes, with the exception of placebo results for time to use of rescue medication in <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2005</LINK>. Five studies were carried out in participants with pain following surgical removal of impacted third molars. These individuals were generally in their early 20s and otherwise fit and healthy, so are clearly not representative of the range of individuals who might need analgesia for acute postoperative pain. There is no <I>a priori </I>reason why analgesic response in these individuals should differ in any systematic way from a more generalised population, but it is entirely possible that adverse events (gastrointestinal in particular) may be more frequent, intense, or severe in older patients and those with comorbidities. The remaining study was carried out in patients with pain following orthopaedic surgery, and while response with placebo was the same as in dental pain, response with etoricoxib was lower in this one study. This may be due to chance, greater age of participants (mean 65 years), or a fundamental difference in the painful condition. Differences between different pain models have either not been demonstrable in the past (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004c</LINK>) or have been possible to demonstrate only where there is an abundance of data (e.g. for ibuprofen; <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009c</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data for doses other than 120 mg were limited to one treatment arm each, so we could not make inferences about benefit and harm of lower and higher doses.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:45:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies were of high methodological quality, scoring 4/5 or 5/5 on the Oxford Quality Scale, and all administered the medication when pain levels were moderate or severe, ensuring that the study was sensitive to detect a 50% reduction.</P>
<P>We judged two studies to be at high risk of bias because the placebo arms were small (&lt; 50 participants), despite moderate numbers (100 to 200) in the active treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2011</LINK>).

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:45:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out a comprehensive search for relevant studies and investigated the potential influence of publication bias by examining the number of participants in studies with zero effect (relative risk of 1.0) needed for the point estimate of the NNT to increase beyond a clinically useful level (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>). In this case, we chose a clinically useful level as eight. For the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief with etoricoxib 120 mg, more than 5000 participants would have to have been involved in unpublished trials with zero treatment effects for the NNT to increase above this threshold. It is highly unlikely that this amount of missing data exists.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-16 14:31:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>A single dose of etoricoxib 120 mg (and probably 90 mg) is an effective analgesic, providing at least 50% pain relief to about two-thirds of treated patients with acute, moderate to severe, postoperative pain (high-quality evidence). The number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) of 1.8 for at least 50% pain relief and median time to use of rescue medication of more than 20 hours are both better than other analgesics commonly used for postoperative pain. In a single dose it is associated with a low rate of mainly mild adverse events, similar to that with placebo.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-16 13:48:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified no new studies for this update. It is unlikely that further studies will be carried out for this dose and in this setting, and if they were, that they would change the result here. Studies at lower doses might help to determine whether lower doses can provide adequate analgesia without loss of duration of action. Multiple-dose studies over a longer duration may help to evaluate the risk of adverse events, particularly rare adverse events (serious, death), and more adequately reflect clinical practice. However, such information is more likely to be taken from studies in chronic pain, such as arthritis.</P>
<P>It is more important to recognise the gulf between results in single-dose clinical trials and in treatment of acute pain in clinical practice. Single-dose trials can show that certain drugs at certain doses produce excellent analgesia in the majority of patients. Surveys consistently show that acute pain is badly treated, even in hospital, and that a large percentage of patients suffer moderate or severe pain over long periods. The clinical practice research agenda is how best to use the excellent analgesics we have to improve day-to-day results in treatment of acute pain in hospital and primary care.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale</HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3, and for relief none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3, and complete = 4). Data from different participants are then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Visual analogue scale <I>(</I>VAS)</HEADING>
<P>For pain intensity, lines with left end labelled "no pain" and right end labelled "worst pain imaginable", and for pain relief lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome the limitation of forcing patient descriptors into particular categories. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain or pain relief. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms, and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and co-ordination are needed, which can be difficult postoperatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR</HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. This is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summed pain intensity difference (SPID)</HEADING>
<P>SPID is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>
<B>VAS TOTPAR</B> and <B>VAS SPID</B> are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
