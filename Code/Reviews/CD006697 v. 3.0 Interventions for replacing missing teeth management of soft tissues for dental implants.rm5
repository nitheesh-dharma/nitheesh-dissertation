<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-06 11:16:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental implants are usually placed by elevating a soft tissue flap, but in some instances, they can also be placed without flap elevation to reduce postoperative discomfort. Several flap and suturing techniques have been proposed. Soft tissues are often manipulated and augmented for aesthetic reasons. It is often recommended that implants are surrounded by 'firm' (attached/keratinised) soft tissues rather than 'movable' gums to improve their long-term prognosis.<BR/>The review found some weak evidence from only two studies with 56 patients that flapless placement of dental implants reduces postoperative discomfort (pain and swelling), without jeopardising implant success in selected patients. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific flap or suturing technique. There is only a small study (10 patients) suggesting that soft tissue grafts from the palate improve gum thickness and aesthetics. There are no studies evaluating whether there is a benefit in increasing the amount of firm gum surrounding dental implants but there is a small trial suggesting that it is possible to increase the amount of firm gum surrounding dental implants using either tissue taken from the palate or a porcine-derived collagen matrix at the price of considerable postoperative pain/discomfort and aesthetic deterioration (there were several cases where the gum receded exposing the metal of the implant).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-06 10:18:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 9 June 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 9 June 2011), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 June 2011). Several dental journals were handsearched. There were no language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-12-06 10:19:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of root-form osseointegrated dental implants, with a follow-up of at least 6 months after function, comparing various techniques to handle soft tissues in relation to dental implants. Outcome measures, according to the different hypotheses, were: prosthetic and implant failures, biological complications, aesthetics evaluated by patients and dentists, postoperative pain, marginal peri-implant bone level changes on periapical radiographs, patient preference, ease of maintenance by patient, soft tissue thickness changes and attached/keratinised mucosa height changes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-12-06 11:02:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted at least in duplicate and independently by two or more review authors. Trial authors were contacted for missing information. Results were expressed using risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-05 12:40:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventeen potentially eligible RCTs were identified but only six trials with 138 patients in total could be included. One study was at low risk of bias, two studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk of bias. Two trials (56 patients) compared flapless placement of dental implants with conventional flap elevation,<B> </B>one trial (10 patients) compared crestal versus vestibular incisions, one trial (20 patients) Erbium:YAG laser versus flap elevation at the second-stage surgery for implant exposure, one split-mouth trial (10 patients) evaluated whether connective tissue graft at implant placement could be effective in augmenting peri-implant tissues, and one trial (40 patients) compared autograft with an animal-derived collagen matrix to increase the height of the keratinised mucosa. On a patient, rather than per implant basis, implants placed with a flapless technique and implant exposures performed with laser induced statistically significantly less postoperative pain than flap elevation.<B> </B>Sites augmented with soft tissues connective grafts showed a better aesthetic and thicker tissues. Both palatal autografts or the use of a porcine-derived collagen matrix are effective in increasing the height of keratinised mucosa at the price of a 0.5 mm recession of peri-implant soft tissues. There were no other statistically significant differences for any of the remaining analyses.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-05 16:00:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited weak evidence suggesting that flapless implant placement is feasible and has been shown to reduce patient postoperative discomfort in adequately selected patients, that augmentation at implant sites with soft tissue grafts is effective in increasing soft tissue thickness improving aesthetics and that one technique to increase the height of keratinised mucosa using autografts or an animal-derived collagen matrix was able to achieve its goal but at the price of a worsened aesthetic outcome (0.5 mm of recession). There is insufficient reliable evidence to provide recommendations on which is the ideal flap design, the best soft tissue augmentation technique, whether techniques to increase the width of keratinised/attached mucosa are beneficial to patients or not, and which are the best incision/suture techniques/materials. Properly designed and conducted RCTs, with at least 6 months of follow-up, are needed to provide reliable answers to these questions.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-05 16:32:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-06 11:26:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with dentures or bridges permitting restoration of chewing function, speech, and aesthetics. Dental implants offer an alternative. These implants are inserted into the jaw bones to support dental prostheses and are retained because of the intimacy of bone growth onto their surface. This direct structural and functional connection between living bone and implant surface, termed osseointegration, was first described by Brånemark (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>) and has undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 40 years.</P>
<P>Implant treatment is widely known by patients who nowadays have increasing aesthetic expectations. Implants are usually placed after soft tissue flap elevation (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>) to visualise better the bone sites where the implant(s) will be placed. Flap elevation ensures that some anatomical landmarks (e.g. foramina, lingual undercuts or maxillary sinuses) are clearly identified and protected. When the amount of available bone is limited, flap elevation will facilitate implant placement maximising bony contact while minimising the risk of bone fenestrations. However, flap elevation is associated with some degree of morbidity and discomfort, and requires suturing. There are situations where flap elevation may not be necessary to allow a successful implant placement since the amount of bone is more than adequate and the risk of complications is minimal. Under these circumstances, flapless implant placement may be indicated. When placing implants with a flapless procedure the surgeon is working blindly and bone perforations are more likely to occur. Guided surgery aided with customised surgical templates derived from CT scans can help clinicians to minimise the risk of perforation and incorrect implant alignment (<LINK REF="REF-van-Steenberghe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Steenberghe 2005</LINK>). From a patient perspective it would be ideal to minimise postoperative discomfort, if the risks of complications/implant failures are not increased.</P>
<P>Sometimes the aesthetic outcome of implant therapy is not ideal. Compromised aesthetics are usually caused by lack of sufficient bone after tooth loss. Several techniques have been proposed to augment bone prior or at implant placement (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2010</LINK>), however, there are situations in which it might be possible to obtain good aesthetic results only by manipulating or augmenting soft tissues. Numerous techniques have been proposed to design flaps, to rebuild the lost interdental papillae, to augment the soft tissues, to suture flaps etc, but it is still unclear which techniques could achieve the best results in a predictable way. Many variations have strong proponents with surgeons claiming that a particular technique offers improved aesthetics. However, there is frequently disagreement and this area is controversial.</P>
<P>Another area of controversy is the need for an adequate band of keratinised/attached mucosa around dental implants to improve their long-term prognosis. Many authors strongly advocate the use of techniques to increase the width of keratinised mucosa, however, no firm evidence has been provided to support this view (<LINK REF="REF-Wennstr_x00f6_m-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennström 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2006</LINK>). A recent study even found a correlation between the presence of an "adequate width of keratinised mucosa" (&gt; 2 mm) and the incidence of peri-implant mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by at least two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. The full reports were assessed independently by at least two review authors to establish whether met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a third review author was consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria then underwent validity assessment and data extraction. Studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table, and reasons for exclusion recorded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by at least two review authors as part of the data extraction process. In the case that the paper to be assessed had one or more review authors in the authors list, it was independently evaluated only by those review authors not involved in the trial.</P>
<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blind outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other issues'). Each domain includes one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summarising risk of bias for a study:</HEADING>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories. We assumed that the risk of bias was the same for all outcomes and each study was assessed as follows:</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measure of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios (RR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group using mean differences and 95% CIs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>

<P>The statistical unit was the patient and not the prosthesis, the procedure or the implant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>All trial authors were contacted to retrieve missing data when necessary. Data were excluded until further clarification was available if agreement could not be reached. Methods in section 7.7.3 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were to be used to estimate missing standard deviations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was to be assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and heterogeneity would have been considered significant if P &lt; 0.1. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, was to be used to quantify heterogeneity with I<SUP>2 </SUP>over 50% being considered substantial heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there had been sufficient numbers of trials (more than 10) in any meta-analysis, publication bias would have been assessed according to the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If asymmetry was identified we would have examined possible causes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures a meta-analysis was to be done. Risk ratios were to be combined for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using fixed-effect models. Random-effects models were to be used when there were more than three studies in a meta-analysis. Data from split-mouth studies were combined with data from parallel group trials with the method outlined by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan. The techniques described by Follmann (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) were used to estimate the standard error of the difference for split-mouth studies, where the appropriate data were not presented and could not be obtained. The Cochrane Handbook recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were followed for RCTs with parallel design with zero-cell counts. The fixed value of 0.5 was automatically added to all cells with zero-cell counts and risk ratios calculated with the RevMan software. If there were no events in both arms, no calculations were undertaken because in this situation the study does not provide any indication of the direction or magnitude of the relative treatment effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was to be assessed by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. No subgroup analyses were planned, however this may be done in future updates of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>It was planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the study quality on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings was also to be examined. There were too few trials in the meta-analyses to undertake these analyses.</P>

<UL>
<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>) compared flapless versus flap elevation to place at least six implants in fully edentulous maxillae. The flapless surgery procedure was performed using individually customised surgical templates fabricated with CAD/CAM technology planned with the Procera Software 3D Planning Program (Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden). In the flapless group, soft tissues were punched away and after implant installation, the punch wounds were sutured. Data were reported in the publication up to 1 month after implant placement, however, the authors provided data up to 6 months after loading.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK>) of split-mouth compared flapless versus flap elevation to place dental implants in partially edentulous patients. Two separate edentulous areas characterised by residual bone least 5 mm thick and 10 mm in height were randomised to receive at least one implant in each side after flap elevation or not. Implants were first placed in one site, and after 2 weeks in the other site with free hand surgery. Surgical templates were used when indicated. Flapless surgery was planned on measurements taken with a bone calliper and intraoral, panoramic or CT scans. It was aimed to place the implants with a minimum insertion torque of 48 Ncm in underprepared sites to be functional loaded the same day with full acrylic restorations which were replaced after 3 months by definitive metal-ceramic restorations. Data up to 1-year follow-up of the implants in function were provided.</LI>

<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2000</LINK>) compared the vestibular incision with the crestal incision using a parallel group design in fully edentulous mandibles. For the crestal incision technique, an incision was made longitudinally along the crest of the alveolar bone through gingiva and periosteum and a vertical incision was made labially in the midline. For the vestibular incision, the incision was made in the vestibular mucosa approximately 10 mm from the top of the alveolar process with the ends extending to the top of the alveolar process. The flap was reflected and two implants were placed. The flap was then replaced and small incisions through the keratinised mucosa were made at the site of the implants. Healing abutments were then connected to the implants through these incisions. All implants were placed with non-submerged approach. Patients were followed for 1 year after placement of the prostheses.</LI>

<LI>Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Arnabat_x002d_Dominguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Arnabat-Dominguez 2003</LINK>) compared Erbium:YAG laser with flap elevation at implant exposure to connect abutments. An Er:YAG laser (Key laser II, KaVo, Biberach, Germany; wavelength 2940 nm) was used using the 2051 and 2056 handpieces, the former operating in non-contact mode and the latter in contact mode with a quartz prism tip. Surgery was initiated using the 2051 non-contact handpiece under a water spray (0.3 mL/minute) at a frequency of 2 Hz and a pulse power rating of 250 mJ, without anaesthesia. The handpiece was used at a focal distance of 14 mm. In those patients who reported no perioperative pain, the parameters were modified, increasing the frequency or pulse energy or both. Local anaesthesia was provided when the intraoperative discomfort (one patient) or bleeding (one patient) prevented the continuation of surgery. When bleeding continued to obstruct the action of the laser beam, the 2056 handpiece (used for periodontal surgery) was used with the quartz prism tip under water drip for contact working. All implants were followed for at least 6 months after abutment connection.</LI>

<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 2010</LINK>) compared soft tissue grafting at implant placement versus no grafting using a split-mouth design in the posterior mandible. For both sites a crestal incision was made, a split thickness flap elevated and each patient received one implant in each side. After implant placement one side was augmented with a subepithelial connective tissue graft taken from the palate. The graft was positioned over the implant to cover both buccal and lingual sides and sutured to the periosteum with 6-0 absorbable suture. Subsequently flaps were closed submerging the implants. Donor sites were sutured and covered with a deep drawing template. For the whole healing period no temporary prostheses was used. After 3 months, the implants were exposed and definitive crowns were fitted 1 month later. Patients were followed for 1 year after loading and were recalled every 3 months for maintenance.</LI>

An intrasulcular incision was made and a mucosal partial thickness flap was raised. The recipient site was prepared by sharp dissection in order to create a periosteal bed free of any muscle attachment. The resulting flap was excised or sutured at the base of the newly created vestibule with 5-0 non-resorbable mattress braided nylon sutures.

<P>Two trials were included (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK> (parallel study design) compared implant placement with or without flap elevation in fully edentulous maxillae. The flapless surgery procedure was performed using individually customised surgical templates fabricated with CAD/CAM technology planned with the Procera Software 3D Planning Program (Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden). In the flapless group, soft tissues were punched away and after implant installation, the punch wounds were then sutured. Eight patients were included in each group. At baseline the patients who were going to receive flapless surgery were less satisfied according to the oral health-related quality of life measured with the OHIP-14. There were no withdrawals and complications up to 6 months. Two implants were lost in the flapless group versus none in the flap elevation group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), this difference was not statistically significant.<B> </B>It is interesting to observe that the study also reported significantly more pain during and just after surgery in the flapless group than in the open flap group.

<LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK> (split-mouth design) compared flapless versus flap elevation implant placement in partially edentulous patients. All implants were placed with an insertion torque <U>&gt;</U> 48 and were immediately functionally loaded. Forty patients were included. No apparent baseline differences were present between the two groups. No patient was lost up to 1 year. In four patients of the flapless group, a flap had to be elevated to properly evaluate the direction of the drills. Two prostheses and two implants failed in each group, all in different patients. There were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis/implant failures (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and biological complications (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) between the groups. One patient had one biological complication (peri-implantitis with purulent discharge) in the flapless group versus four complications in three patients (one intrasurgical haemorrhage; one intrasurgical fracture of the buccal bone plate, one peri-implant marginal bone loss exceeding 4 mm, one patient experiencing pain on chewing) in the flap elevation group. Less patients subjected to a flapless procedure experienced postoperative pain than those subjected to flap elevation (19 versus 30 patients) (mean difference -1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.02 to -0.18; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). There were no differences for peri-implant marginal bone levels (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Thirty-one patients preferred the flapless intervention, three patients preferred flap elevation and six patients had no preference. This difference was statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 106.70; 95% CI 20.97 to 542.82; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

Ten patients were included in each group. It is unclear whether any baseline differences among the two groups existed. No withdrawal or implant failures occurred up to 6 months after abutment connection. Patients treated with laser did not receive local anaesthesia, though two patients had to be anaesthetised during the procedure: one because of pain and one because of profuse bleeding (complication). In the latter case the 2056 laser handpiece for periodontal surgery was used. Less patients treated with laser experienced postoperative pain than those treated with conventional flap elevation: RR 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.90; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). In the article it was also reported that patients of the laser group consumed significantly less analgesics and that the prosthetic procedures could start earlier (after 7.3 days) than in patients of the conventional flap group (after 13.6 days).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lorenzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzo 2011</LINK> (parallel group study) compared two techniques to increase the height of the keratinised mucosa around implants having &#8804; 1 mm of keratinised mucosa using a xenogeneic collagen matrix of porcine origin in 12 patients (Mucograft®; Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) or a connective tissue autograft harvested from the palate in 12 patients for 6 months. No apparent baseline differences were present between the two groups. Despite that it was declared that an intention-to-treat was made, the authors withdrew two patients from the Mucograft group with the motivation that they increased the amount of smoked cigarettes above the inclusion threshold of the study (10 cigarettes/day) and did not present pain data of a patient from the autograft group since the patient had a sport trauma and consequently, he was prescribed high doses of ibuprofen. Therefore the trial was judged to be at high risk of bias and results should be viewed with caution. No implant failure or biological complication was reported. Both procedures were able to increase the width of keratinised mucosa (2.4 mm Mucograft versus 2.3 mm autograft) but there were no differences between the two procedures (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). The actual data on postoperative pain after 10 and 30 days, consumption of analgesics, and aesthetic evaluated by dentist as colour blending of the grafts in the surrounding tissues were not presented in the article, so we could not use them. There was no difference for aesthetics assessed as recession (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>), however, it is interesting to observe that both procedures determined an increase of recession (0.4 mm for the Mucograft and 0.5 mm for the autograft) which exposed some of the titanium abutments determining a worsening in aesthetics from the initial situation.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-05 15:52:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventeen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been identified on how to manage peri-implant soft tissues in implant dentistry, however, we were able to include only six of these trials. Even more disappointing was the lack of replies from the authors of some of the trials to our request of information. Therefore some of the included trials may not even be RCTs or on the contrary, useful information could have been collected but not published leaving the reader with a great deal of uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and the transferability of the results to routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>Two trials were designed to assess whether there could be any advantages/additional risks when placing dental implants without flap elevation (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK>). The results of these two trials are apparently contradictory and the possible factors influencing these differences ought to be discussed. While the results of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK>) suggested that flapless implant placement was almost three times faster than flap elevation and induced less postoperative pain, swelling, consumption of analgesics, and was preferred by the patients, the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>) suggested that the flapless procedure required more time and was more painful during and just after surgery. While in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK>) the flapless procedure was implemented by free hand in partially edentulous patients, in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>), implants were placed with guided surgery using a stent fixed with three intrabony pins to fully edentulous maxillae. The findings of the <LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK> study are supported by the results of two other RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Fortin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fortin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2008</LINK>), which were included in the previous version of this systematic review but have been excluded in this update because patients were followed-up for only 6 days and it was not reported whether implants were successful or not (<LINK REF="STD-Fortin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fortin 2006</LINK>), and other interventions, such as underpreparation of the implant sites, higher insertion torques and immediate loading of the flapless placed implants only, confounded the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2008</LINK>). A speculative explanation is that the fully edentulous patients treated with the flapless approach (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>), received less local anaesthesia to minimise alterations of the soft tissue profiles to avoid possible distortion of the correct positioning of the surgical guide and/or that a freehand approach gives the operator a better feedback enabling him to adjust the procedure and even to elevate a flap when judged to be necessary. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cannizzaro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cannizzaro 2011</LINK>) neither increased failure nor complication rates were observed for the flapless placed implants, however, readers should consider that the operator of this trial has significant clinical experience with the flapless procedures and therefore the extrapolation of his results to other settings has to be done with caution. It should be also observed that the only two failures reported by the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2010</LINK>) were flapless placed implants. However, despite that 'common sense' would suggest that flapless procedures would induce less postoperative discomfort but there could be a higher risk for complications/failures, it is definitely preferable though that 'common sense' is backed-up by sound scientific evidence, since sometimes 'common sense' guides towards decisions which may have negative consequences for patients. Therefore more trials are needed to better understand the actual advantages and disadvantages of flapless implant placement.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2000</LINK>) was aimed at evaluating which type of surgical incisions could be preferable for implant placement: a crestal or a vestibular approach. Only 10 patients were included in the trial and the number of reported complications was unusually high being 50%. We feel that the very small number of patients is a major issue, since the high number of complications may have occurred simply by chance. It would be prudent not to extrapolate any conclusions from this pilot study, with the exception of the need of conducting larger multicentre trials to answer this question. Such trials are particularly easy to design and conduct since the follow-up can be rather short and it would be easy to recruit large numbers of patients.</P>
<P>One single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Arnabat_x002d_Dominguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Arnabat-Dominguez 2003</LINK>) evaluated whether a Erbium:YAG laser could be advantageous over flap elevation at the two-stage surgery to connect the abutments to the implants. The results suggested that local anaesthesia may not be required for the majority of patients subjected to laser intervention and that postoperative pain and consumption of analgesics were significantly less when the laser was used, and that the prosthetic procedures could start earlier (after 7.3 days) than in patients of the conventional flap group (after 13.6 days). However, we do not share the same 'enthusiasm' of the authors favouring the laser intervention. The only complication occurred in a patient treated with the laser: profuse bleeding which could not be controlled by the vasoconstrictor contained in the local anaesthetic. The authors had to use an alternative laser handpiece to complete the surgery. One of the disadvantages with laser is its cost and the need of additional training for the operators to face various possible situations. Moreover the authors did not use an appropriate control group. In the control group they elevated a flap after surgical incision which was then sutured, but they could have used a 'punch technique' or even better a minimally invasive 'H' incision technique instead. These techniques usually do not require flap elevation and suturing. The 'H' incision technique allows also the preservation of keratinised/attached mucosa which will be lost using the laser or the punch. The authors did not declare or respond concerning whether the study was sponsored by the laser manufacturer or not.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological issues in the studies</HEADING>
<P>What is striking is that for techniques aimed at manipulating or augmenting soft tissues mostly for aesthetic reasons or for those techniques aimed at increasing the width of keratinised/attached mucosa allegedly done to improve the long-term prognosis of dental implants, there are only two acceptable RCTs published in the world literature (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzo 2011</LINK>). Another five identified trials which were excluded from this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kerscher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kerscher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Covani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Covani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahidi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shahidi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sanz 2009</LINK>), of which one in German (<LINK REF="STD-Kerscher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kerscher 1993</LINK>) and one in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 2006</LINK>), resulted in no clinical value because of the poor way they were reported or for thedue to poor reporting or insufficient minimumduration of follow-up. Literally hundreds of thousands of patients have been subjected to various procedures to increase the keratinised/attached mucosa and yet stilldespite that this issue is highly controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Wennstr_x00f6_m-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennström 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2006</LINK>) and that there is no reliable evidence to back up these procedures. This does not mean that a sufficient width of keratinised/attached mucosa is not beneficial for the patients, but we do need reliable evidence proving or rejecting this hypothesis.</P>
<P>Only one pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 2010</LINK>) evaluated the efficacy of a connective tissue graft from the palate to augment soft tissues to improve aesthetics around dental implants. To avoid issue with the control side of the patients, it was decided only to include posterior mandible areas since these have little aesthetic impact. Despite the small sample size it could be concluded that grafts were effective for augmenting soft tissues, in fact, after 6 months augmented sites were 1.3 mm thicker than untreated control sites, and aesthetics were significantly improved. Despite the fact that patients did prefer the augmented sites, seven patients were uncertain or unwilling to undergo the augmentation procedure again on the contra-lateral side. A possible explanation is that since augmentations were done in non-aesthetic areas, patients did not perceive any "visible" advantage motivating them to undergo the same procedure again.</P>
<P>The only trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lorenzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzo 2011</LINK>) which compared two techniques for increasing the height of the keratinised mucosa provided results which need some careful reflection: while the advantages of increasing the keratinised mucosa height are yet to be demonstrated, both the tested interventions did compromise the aesthetic outcomes by increasing recessions of about 0.5 mm at treated sites which caused in many cases the exposure of the metallic abutment through the soft tissues. This example casts serious doubts on the personal "clinical feeling" commonly used by clinicians to justify the effectiveness of the procedures that they are using and underscores once more the need for proper scientific evaluation of procedures and materials currently used in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Among the excluded studies the one by <LINK REF="STD-Ivanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ivanoff 2001</LINK>, comparing resorbable versus non-resorbable sutures, deserves some additional comments. Patients were allocated to the intervention groups by birth date (quasi-randomisation) and various types of suture techniques (single, continuous or a combination of both types) were used according to surgeon preference. This created unbalanced groups and heavily confounded the aim of the study, i.e. comparing types of sutures and not the suture techniques. We feel that no reliable conclusions can be made from this trial. Randomisation should be properly performed. By using patient birthday no allocation concealment could be implemented giving the surgeons prior knowledge of group allocation. This has been shown to bias results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995b</LINK>). In addition, since the suture technique is likely to influence the results, the same type of suture technique should have been used in both groups. Furthermore, the suture technique could have been randomised.</P>

<P>1a) There is limited weak evidence suggesting that flapless implant placement can cause less postoperative pain, edema and consumption of analgesics than flap elevation. Flapless surgery performed by skilful clinicians in properly selected cases can be as successful and complication-free as conventional flap elevation. However, there is still insufficient evidence regarding a potential increased risk of complications/failures using a flapless approach. Clinicians should select patients for flapless implant placement with a great deal of caution in relation to their own clinical skills and experience. The safety and efficacy of customised surgical templates created with the help of planning software on CT scans to facilitate flapless placement of dental implants still needs to be assessed, especially for fully edentulous patients where it might be more difficult to correctly position the stent.</P>
<P>1b) There is insufficient evidence to suggest which is the best flap design.<BR/>
</P>
<P>2a-b) There is weak evidence suggesting that soft tissue autografts increase soft tissue thickness improving the aesthetic outcome, however, we do not know which technique is the most effective.</P>
<P>3a-b) There is weak evidence suggesting that grafting, either with an autograft or with a xenogenic collagen matrix, is able to increase the height of the peri-implant keratinised mucosa but at risk of soft tissue recessions which could compromise the aesthetic outcome if the abutment becomes visible, however, it is still unknown whether an increase of keratinised mucosa is of any benefit for the patient.</P>
<P>4) There is still a lack of evidence about the most effective incision/suturing techniques/materials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-05 16:32:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More properly designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials with at least 6 months of follow-up are needed to evaluate the potential risks/advantages of flapless procedures and the safety and efficacy of implant planning software based on CT scans. There is a need to evaluate whether techniques aimed at increasing the keratinised/attached mucosa are of any benefit for patients, and which could be the most effective techniques to modify/augment soft tissues for aesthetic reasons. Relevant outcome measures should include implant success, complications, and aesthetic parameters evaluated both by patients and dentists.</P>

<P>The article reported: "Only one of the investigators (Marco Esposito), not involved in the selection and treatment of the patients, was aware of the randomisation sequence and could have access to the randomisation list stored in his pass-word protected portable computer.The information on how to treat first site was enclosed in sequentially numbered, identical, opaque, sealed envelopes. Envelopes were opened sequentially after delivery of local anaesthesia and the surgeon treated in that occasion only the first of the 2 sites, after 2 weeks the second site was treated according to the allocated procedure. Therefore, treatment allocation was concealed to the investigators in charge of enrolling and treating the patients." and "If the upper right side did not need implant(s), the lower right was selected and, if also this side did not need implants either, the upper left jaw was selected. After delivery of local anaesthesia the surgeon was informed whether to raise a flap or not at the selected side by opening a sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelope. Only one side was treated during the first session, the second side was treated after 2 weeks according to a split-mouth design."</P>
