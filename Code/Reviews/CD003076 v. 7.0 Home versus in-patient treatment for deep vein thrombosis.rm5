This can happen after surgery, after trauma, when a person is immobile for a long time, or for no obvious reason. Clots can dislodge and block blood flow to the lungs (pulmonary embolism (PE)), which can be fatal. DVT and PE are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Heparin is a blood-thinning drug that is used to treat DVT during the first three to five days. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is administered intravenously in hospital with laboratory monitoring. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are given by subcutaneous injection once a day and can be given at home. Oral anticoagulants are then continued for three to six months. After recovery from the acute episode, people may develop post-thrombotic syndrome with leg swelling, varicose veins, and ulceration.</P><P><B>Study characteristics and key results</B></P><P>Seven randomised controlled trials involving 1839 patients with clinically confirmed DVT compared home (LMWH) versus hospital (unfractionated heparin, or LMWH in one trial) treatment. Trials had limitations, including high exclusion rates and designs that did not take into account short hospital stays for any of the people treated at home to allow fair comparison of heparin in hospital with LMWH at home.</P><P>Trials showed that patients treated at home with LMWH had less recurrence of VTE than hospital-treated patients. The review showed no clear differences between treatment groups for major bleeding, minor bleeding, or death. No study reported venous gangrene. We could not pool information on patient satisfaction and quality of life, as studies had different ways of reporting these, but two of the three studies reporting on quality of life provided evidence that home treatment led to greater improvement in quality of life compared with in-patient treatment, at some point during follow-up. The third study reported that a large number of participants chose to switch from in-patient care to home-based care for social and personal reasons, indicating that home treatment was better accepted than in-patient treatment. Studies that looked at cost found that cost of home management was lower per incident of treatment.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Overall, the quality of evidence of the available data was low to very low owing to risk of bias, indirectness, and differences in measuring and reporting of outcomes. Risk of bias is a concern, as many of the included studies did not fully explain how they randomised and allocated participants to treatments, and blinding techniques described were not clear. Full blinding would be difficult if not impossible for these types of treatments (home vs hospital), but some techniques could be put in place such as using the same treatment medications or blinding those who measure outcomes. Another concern of reviewers was that in some studies, participants randomised to home treatment actually ended up being treated in hospital but remained in their assigned treatment for the analysis (this is known as indirectness). This makes it hard to determine whether trial results actually can be used to answer the question of whether home versus hospital treatment for DVT is superior. A further concern regarding a few of outcomes is variation in the way outcomes were measured and reported.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-09 09:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:06:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow through a vein, which can occur after surgery, after trauma, or when a person has been immobile for a long time.

Heparin (in the form of unfractionated heparin (UFH)) is a blood-thinning drug used during the first three to five days of DVT treatment.

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed included studies for risk of bias. Primary outcomes included combined VTE events (PE and recurrent DVT), gangrene, heparin complications, and death. Secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction and cost implications. We performed meta-analysis using fixed-effect models with risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:07:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included in this review seven RCTs involving 1839 randomised participants with comparable treatment arms. All seven had fundamental problems including high exclusion rates, partial hospital treatment of many in the home treatment arms, and comparison of UFH in hospital versus LMWH at home. These trials showed that patients treated at home with LMWH were less likely to have recurrence of VTE events than those given hospital treatment with UFH or LMWH (fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.86; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.007; low-quality evidence). No clear difference was seen between groups for major bleeding (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.36; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.27; low-quality evidence), minor bleeding (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.78; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.11; low-quality evidence), or mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.11; low-quality evidence). The included studies reported no cases of venous gangrene. We could not combine patient satisfaction and quality of life outcomes in meta-analysis owing to heterogeneity of reporting, but two of three studies found evidence that home treatment led to greater improvement in quality of life compared with in-patient treatment at some point during follow-up, and the third study reported that a large number of participants chose to switch from in-patient care to home-based care for social and personal reasons, suggesting it is the patient's preferred option (very low-quality evidence). None of the studies included in this review carried out a full cost-effectiveness analysis. However, a small randomised economic evaluation of the two alternative treatment settings involving 131 participants found that direct costs were higher for those in the in-patient group. These findings were supported by three other studies that reported on their costs (very low-quality evidence).</P><P>Quality of evidence for data from meta-analyses was low to very low. This was due to risk of bias, as many of the included studies used unclear randomisation techniques, and blinding was a concern for many. Also, indirectness was a concern, as most studies included a large number of participants randomised to the home (LMWH) treatment group who were treated in hospital for some or all of the treatment period. A further issue for some outcomes was heterogeneity that was evident in measurement and reporting of outcomes.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-09 09:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Low-quality evidence suggests that patients treated at home with LMWH are less likely to have recurrence of VTE than those treated in hospital. However, data show no clear differences in major or minor bleeding, nor in mortality (low-quality evidence), indicating that home treatment is no worse than in-patient treatment for these outcomes. Because most healthcare systems are moving towards more LMWH usage in the home setting it is unlikely that additional large trials will be undertaken to compare these treatments. Therefore, home treatment is likely to become the norm, and further research will be directed towards resolving practical issues by devising local guidelines that include clinical prediction rules, developing biomarkers and imaging that can be used to tailor therapy to disease severity, and providing training for community healthcare workers who administer treatment and monitor treatment progress.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-09 13:44:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:49:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:49:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a frequent disorder in western medical practice, affecting one to two per thousand of the adult population annually. DVT occurs in conjunction with malignancy, after surgery, and after trauma and immobilisation, and can occur spontaneously. It manifests in the acute stage with leg symptoms and, in a small minority, with potentially fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a term that refers to both DVT and PE. After recovery from the acute episode, people may develop post-thrombotic syndrome with leg swelling, varicosis, and ulceration. Gold standard techniques for diagnosing DVT include ascending venography and duplex ultrasound scanning. Deep vein thrombosis is most commonly managed by anticoagulants to prevent spread of the clot proximally and to allow it to become adherent or undergo fibrinolysis, thus reducing the risk of PE. Currently used anticoagulant treatments include unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin (UFH and LMWH, respectively), as well as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), primarily warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Es-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Es 2014</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:08:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In the hospitalised patient, UFH is usually administered intravenously, with laboratory monitoring for about five days, overlapping with oral anticoagulants, which are continued for three to six months. LMWH is administered daily by subcutaneous injection; it can be delivered at home without the need for continuous laboratory monitoring and may be followed by an oral anticoagulant regimen.</P></INTERVENTION><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:08:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Development of LMWHs has resulted in many trials investigating their efficaciousness and safety, as compared with UFH. These studies show that LMWH is at least as effective as UFH; some meta-analyses and reviews show that LMWH is more effective and safer than UFH (<LINK REF="REF-Erkens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leizorovicz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leizorovicz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lensing-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lensing 1995</LINK>). Because LMWH is given subcutaneously once per day and requires no laboratory monitoring, it is possible to treat people with LMWH at home. Although LMWH has been available since 1976, home treatment has not been investigated further since the time it was first reported in 1988 (<LINK REF="REF-Bakker-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakker 1988</LINK>). Rigorous evaluation of home versus in-patient care is required to inform policy on alternative strategies for treating patients with DVT. Home treatment of DVT offers potential cost savings and improved social acceptability for the patients. This review aims to update the review that was first published in 2001 and updated in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Othieno-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Othieno 2007</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:08:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To compare the incidence and complications of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients treated at home versus patients treated with standard in-patient hospital regimens.

Data show no clear differences in major or minor bleeding events nor in mortality (all low-quality evidence), indicating that home treatment is no worse for these outcomes when compared with in-patient treatment.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-09 09:59:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Although the results of this review are promising, review authors have several concerns about the applicability of the evidence. Our primary concern is that a large number of participants in the home treatment group were not treated solely at home. Also, there was heterogeneity in the findings of the larger trials, making it difficult to interpret and apply the results. Finally, a large number of eligible participants were excluded from trials before randomisation, raising concerns about applicability.</P><P>Many of the participants randomised to home treatment with LMWH were not actually treated fully at home but were hospitalised for some or all of the treatment period (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for details). Only 40% (in <LINK REF="STD-B_x00e4_ckman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bäckman 2004</LINK>), 23% (in <LINK REF="STD-Chong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 2005</LINK>), 36% (in <LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1996</LINK>), 48.5% (in <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1996</LINK>), and 36% (in <LINK REF="STD-Ramacciotti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ramacciotti 2004</LINK>) of those randomised to home treatment were treated wholly at home, making trial results difficult to interpret. In three trials, participants randomised to LMWH treatment, as opposed to unfractionated heparin (UFH), could be treated at home or in an in-patient setting at the discretion of clinicians or investigators (<LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramacciotti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ramacciotti 2004</LINK>). This creates the concern that data collected and reported in meta-analyses may not directly speak to the question at hand. To address these issues, we conducted extensive sensitivity analyses and found no differences in our findings when we excluded the findings of these studies. This issue is a problem not just with these few trials; rather, it is an overall, possibly insurmountable problem, as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and its complications by their nature may require in-patient treatment, even if a person is deemed acceptable for home treatment. However, these trials have shown that patients treated at home with LMWH are less likely to have recurrence of VTE than their counterparts treated in hospital with UFH or LMWH. Also, researchers found that participants preferred to have treatment at home. Concerns presented here most likely contribute to dilution of review conclusions.</P><P>The three major randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared UFH in hospital versus LMWH at home (<LINK REF="STD-Chong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1996</LINK>). A more methodologically sound trial would have compared LMWH in both groups, and this would have been justified by the many trials and three meta-analyses showing that LMWH is at least as effective as UFH (<LINK REF="REF-Erkens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leizorovicz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leizorovicz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lensing-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lensing 1995</LINK>).</P><P>Another factor limiting review conclusions was the very high prerandomisation exclusion rate reported by several trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1996</LINK> reported exclusion of 31% of eligible participants, and <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1996</LINK> reported exclusion of 67%.

Treatment with LMWHs and DOACs has been shown to be efficacious, with no increase in clinically relevant complications (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2017</LINK>). Although UFH treatment is not going to disappear completely, practitioners have been moving away from its usage and embracing LMWH and DOACs owing to monitoring requirements and subsequent costs of treatment with UFH. However, clinicians using DOACs to treat patients with VTE have to reckon with their complexity, involving appropriate dose selection for the relevant indication, avoidance of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and consideration of dose adjustments in specific clinical situations, such as organ dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Finks-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finks 2016</LINK>). This review did not evaluate any studies that included the use of DOACs, such as rivaroxaban or dabigatran, as no such studies met our inclusion criteria. We therefore have presented limited evidence in this review for detailed discussion of their use.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:15:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Strengths of the evidence include the consistency and homogeneity of results from individual studies, as well as sufficient numbers of participants and events included for each outcome. However, we downgraded evidence generated in this review to low quality owing to concerns about risk of bias of individually included studies, as well as indirectness of the data due to issues surrounding hospitalisation of participants randomised to home treatment, as discussed in the previous section. A major concern associated with risk of bias was selection bias: All seven included studies were at unclear or high risk for concerns with random sequence generation or allocation concealment. Although minimising performance bias would be very difficult owing to the open nature of the treatment, making blinding of participants and personnel nearly impossible, these issues could be addressed in other ways, such as keeping treatment drugs consistent between interventions or demonstrating more stringent control of detection bias. Risk of bias concerns led us to downgrade the quality of evidence by one level. These concerns reduce the robustness of findings. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for further information.</P><P>We conducted sensitivity analysis by evaluating the strength of evidence in light of risk of bias issues, as well as concerns with indirectness, and we found that findings did not change when we removed studies with high risk of bias, or studies that may not have directly contributed to the objectives of the review.</P><P>We did not investigate publication bias for the review because we included fewer than 10 studies in the individual meta-analyses, precluding robust results in the funnel plots used to investigate publication bias.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-08 12:16:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>During the review process, we adhered to all possible measures to reduce potential biases, including conducting a comprehensive search, performing double data extraction, and grading the evidence.

Fifty-three participants had proximal thrombosis and were admitted for one day for investigation, including lung scan: 16 scans were positive, although participants were asymptomatic and the result did not affect their management at home. The 47 participants with distal thrombosis were treated entirely at home. The clot was initially extended in 13.2% of distal and 2.7% of proximal thromboses, but at follow-up scans at six months, 60.7% of distal and 18.5% of proximal thromboses had completely resolved. The only complications were six minor bleeds. The numbers of participants referred but cleared of DVT, and the numbers rejected by the protocol, were not mentioned.
