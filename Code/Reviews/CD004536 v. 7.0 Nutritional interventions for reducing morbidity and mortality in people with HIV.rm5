<P>Achieving and maintaining optimal nutrition is considered an important adjunct in the clinical care of patients infected with HIV, as good nutrition can improve an individual's immune function, limit disease-specific complications, and improve quality of life and survival. We sought to determine whether macronutrient interventions, either given to provide protein and/or energy or test the effect of specific macronutrients (i.e. ch as amino acids, whey protein concentrate or Spirulina), given orally, influence morbidity and mortality in adults and children living with HIV infection. Our review, based on fourteen small trials, evaluating different macronutrient supplements, found limited evidence that balanced macronutrient formulas increase protein and energy intake. However, we found no evidence that such supplementation translates into reductions in disease progression or HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or death.</P>

<P>Fourteen trials (including 1725 HIV positive adults and 271 HIV positive children), were included in this review. Neither supplementary food nor daily supplement of Spirulina significantly altered the risk of death compared with no supplement or placebo in malnourished, ART naive adult participants in the two studies which reported on this outcome. A nutritional supplement enhanced with protein did not significantly alter the risk of death compared to standard nutritional care in children with prolonged diarrhoea. Supplementation with macronutrient formulas given to provide protein and/or energy and fortified with micronutrients, in conjunction with nutrition counselling, significantly improved energy intake (3 trials; n=131; MD 393.57 kcal/day; 95% CI: 224.66 to 562.47;p&lt;0.00001) and protein intake (2 trials; n=81; MD 23.5 g/day; 95% CI: 12.68, 34.01; p&lt;0.00001) compared with no nutritional supplementation or nutrition counselling alone in adult participants with weight loss. In general supplementation with specific macronutrients such as amino acids, whey protein concentration or Spirulina did not significantly alter clinical, anthropometric or immunological outcomes compared with placebo in HIV-infected adults and children.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">HIV/AIDS and macronutrient deficiency</HEADING>
<P>Adequate nutrition is critical for optimal immune function. Dietary therapy is therefore regarded as an important adjunct in the clinical care of patients infected with HIV. It is believed that achieving and maintaining optimal nutrition will improve the individual's immune function, reduce the incidence of complications associated with HIV infection, attenuate the progression of HIV infection, improve quality of life, and ultimately reduce mortality associated with the disease (<LINK REF="REF-de-Pee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Pee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>People living with HIV are at great risk of nutritional disorders. This is the case in both untreated (i.e. not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART)) and treated (i.e. receiving some form of ART) HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, HIV infection is most prevalent in parts of the world where food security is compromised. Populations at high risk of HIV infection may lack appropriate nourishment prior to infection by HIV. Starvation and undernourishment severely compromise the immune system thereby increasing both susceptibility to HIV infection and progression of HIV/AIDS. (<LINK REF="REF-Scrimshaw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scrimshaw 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anabwani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anabwani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaible-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaible 2007</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Untreated HIV infection is characterised by increased resting energy expenditure (REE, <LINK REF="REF-Kosmiski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosmiski 2011</LINK>), decreased appetite, decreased intake and digestion of food and decreased absorption of nutrients (<LINK REF="REF-Koethe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koethe 2010</LINK>). HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy may experience the adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs such as nausea and insomnia, which also have a negative impact on nutrient status. Poor nutrient status may in turn exacerbate these adverse effects, in part by increased drug toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Ammassari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammassari 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardon 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a result of the increased REE in untreated HIV infection, both fat and protein stores are oxidised to fuel the body's energy requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Macallan-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macallan 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Batterham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batterham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kosmiski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosmiski 2011</LINK>). Whole-body protein turnover is up to 25% higher in untreated HIV-infected individuals than in HIV-negative controls (<LINK REF="REF-Macallan-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macallan 1995b</LINK>) and fat stores are replenished more readily than protein stores even when nutrition is adequate (<LINK REF="REF-Kotler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotler 1999</LINK>). The resultant loss of body protein could further compromise the immune system of the HIV-infected individual (<LINK REF="REF-Schaible-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaible 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>HIV-associated weight loss and wasting are independent contributing factors to poor clinical outcomes in people living with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotler 1989</LINK>). In most cases, acute weight-loss episodes are associated with secondary infections (<LINK REF="REF-Macallan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macallan 1993</LINK>). Once the secondary infections are successfully treated and energy intake is increased sufficiently, patients are able to regain weight and remain weight-stable (<LINK REF="REF-Macallan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macallan 1998</LINK>). Instances of chronic weight loss are normally associated with secondary gastrointestinal infections and subsequent malabsorption (<LINK REF="REF-Macallan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macallan 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Weight loss and low Body Mass Index (BMI &lt; 17kg.m<SUP>-2</SUP>), a proxy for poor<SUP> </SUP>nutritional status, are independent predictors of mortality, particularly in resource-limited settings (<LINK REF="REF-Marazzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marazzi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2011</LINK>). This remains true despite the introduction of ART. In a recent study, <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2011</LINK> found that HIV-infected patients with low BMI (BMI&lt;17kg.m<SUP>-2</SUP>) had a significantly higher risk of early mortality (death within 3 months) following the initiation of ART. Of the patients who survived the first 3 months of ART, those who experienced weight loss had a higher risk of subsequent death compared to those who were weight stable during this period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Macronutrients and macronutrient interventions</HEADING>
<P>Macronutrients are variably defined but are classically understood to be essential nutrients that are required by the body in relatively large amounts. Dorland&#8217;s Illustrated Medical Dictionary defines macronutrients as carbohydrates, fats and proteins and states that: &#8216;minerals necessary in relatively large amounts (for example Calcium, Chloride, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium and Sulphur) are sometimes included and sometimes excluded.&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Dorland-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorland 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Macronutrient interventions</HEADING>
<P>In this review, a macronutrient intervention could be any intervention given to provide protein and/or energy, ie through carbohydrates and/or fat, by replacing or supplementing the normal diet (for example, high or low fat/carbohydrate/protein diets). Macronutrient interventions can also include dietary supplements not given specifically to provide energy but rather to test the effectiveness of specific nutritional elements (for example, amino acids, whey protein concentrate and Spirulina). Macronutrient interventions may be delivered in liquid, powder or tablet formulation. In resource-scare regions where malnutrition is prevalent, food programmes deliver replacement food or foodstuffs in addition to local staple foods in the form of 1) high-energy ready-to-use therapeutic foods, 2) corn-soya blends, or 3) fortified blended foods, ready-to-use foods, high-energy biscuits and compressed food bars (<LINK REF="REF-World-Food-Programme" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Food Programme</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koethe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koethe 2009</LINK>). Macronutrient supplements may be fortified with micronutrients in the form of vitamins and trace elements. An existing Cochrane review, revised in 2010, has summarised the effects of micronutrient supplementation in people with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2010</LINK>).</P>

In seven studies the majority (&gt;50%) or all participants were CDC category C (AIDS) or WHO Stage III/IV. More men participated in trials than women. Trials evaluated interventions in participants from diverse populations including those with normal weight, those with stable weight loss, and those with malnutrition. In one trial participants were TB/HIV co-infected (<LINK REF="STD-Sudarsanam-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sudarsanam 2011</LINK>). In the remaining trials all participants were free of confirmed secondary infections or other signs and symptoms of infection, such as fever, chills, or persistent diarrhoea upon enrollment into the study.

Proxies of these outcomes, such as body weight, body composition, viral load, CD4 count, energy intake and quality of life were measured. Outcomes were not consistently reported across trials with some reports conducting analyses with means (normal distribution) and others reporting medians (non-normal distribution) for the same outcomes. In general, outcomes measured anthropometric and immunologic parameters rather than clinical symptoms. Although most trials reported on BMI in the baseline characteristics, few reported on it as an outcome of the trial.</P>

The food product was a blend of maize, soya, vegetable oil, sugar, whey protein concentrate, and micronutient pre-mix. The food was provided in 300 gram packets and provided 1320 kcal/day energy and 48 g/day protein. At the time of the study, the cost of the food product was approximately $1/kg, or $0.30/300g dose, or $0.23/1,000 kcal. All patients in the study received nutrition counselling according to national protocols and using counselling materials and job aids provided by NASCOP.  The nutrition counseling was usually carried out by a trained nutritionist or dietician and focused on supporting the client in appropriate weight gain and management of diet-related symptoms and food-drug interactions. </P>

<P>The authors report that most of the changes in quality of life occurred during the initial months of the study. The majority of the ART and pre-ART participants experienced improvements in perceived health or their perceived health remained good, in both supplement and no supplement groups. The authors report that pre-ART participants receiving supplementary food on average experienced significantly greater improvement and less of a decline in perceived health than those not receiving food.  These differences did not persist over longer periods of follow-up.  Among ART participants, the difference in changes in perceived health between those receiving food and those not receiving food was smaller and not statistically significant (data presented graphically).</P>
<P>In the report, quality of life was also measured by the number of days per month that subjects reported having had poor physical health during the first three months. The authors report that among pre-ART participants, those receiving food had fewer poor health days than those not receiving food, and the differences were significant during the first and second months, but not subsequently.  Among ART participants, the difference was significant in the second month only (data presented graphically). <B>

The supplement consisted of three daily servings of a cereal and lentil mixture (providing 930 kcal and 31.5 g protein) and a once a day multivitamin tablet. Patients were given a months supply of supplement at a time. TB/HIV-coinfected individuals were treated for TB but did not receive ART, as per protocol in India at the time.

</P>
<P>The primary outcome of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Rollins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rollins 2007</LINK> was weight change from enrolment until 8 weeks among 169 HIV-infected children. The study reported that children receiving enhanced nutrition support had significantly more weight gain in the first 8 weeks than children receiving standard care (weight gain was expressed as the median change in age- and sex specific weight standard deviation scores (SDS): +1.02 (enhanced nutritional support group) vs +0.01 (standard nutritional support group), p &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Mean weight-for-age standard deviation score (WFA-SDS) at baseline of those who dropped out was not different between groups: (Standard nutritional support group dropouts: &#8211;3.24 vs; enhanced nutritional support group dropouts: &#8211;3.39; p &gt; 0.05) standard nutritional support group completers: &#8211;3.00, vs enhanced nutritional support group completers: &#8211;3.19, p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the observed outcome among the completers appeared to be unaffected by dropout bias.</P>
<P>After 8 weeks, weight gain was similar between groups, with only a slight increase in weight-SDS over time in each group. Median change in weight-SDS from 8 to 14 weeks of follow-up: +0.21 (enhanced nutritional support group) vs. 0.00 (standard nutrition support group: 14 to 26 weeks of follow-up: +0.12 (enhanced nutritional support group) vs. +0.24 (standard nutritional support).</P>
<P>Children receiving enhanced nutritional support exhibited significantly higher median attained WFA-SDS after 8 weeks (-1.99 vs -3.06, p&lt;0.05), 14 weeks (-1.69 vs -2.96, p,0.05) and 26 weeks (-1.32 vs -2.63, p,0.05) compared to the children receiving standard nutritional support. Children in the enhanced nutritional support group who were randomised to continue with the enhanced nutrition support until 6 months showed a further improvement in median attained WFA-SDS (&#8722;1.01 SDS) at 6 months compared to those who reverted back to standard home diet who maintained the same median value attained at 3 months (-1.68 SDS).</P>
<P>No significant differences in CD4 cell counts or viral load between groups or over time were reported. However, it should be noted that changes in viral load could only be assessed in a subset of 70 children.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-16 01:47:10 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review establishes that experimental evidence on the effects of macronutrient supplementation on important clinical outcomes in HIV-infected adults and children is surprisingly limited; despite an exhaustive search, we found only 14 relatively small randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria of our review. Apart from the two trials evaluating Spirulina, one trial in adults and one trial in children, each of the trials evaluated a different macronutrient supplement. Participants included in the trials also varied quite considerably in terms of stage of HIV, HIV treatment status and general nutrient status. Only three trials reported on mortality, two trials in adults and one trial in children. Meta-analysis was only possible on one class of supplements, viz. balanced macronutrient supplements fortified with micronutrients plus nutrition counselling versus nutritional counselling alone or standard care. GRADE assessments were conducted on outcomes for this meta-analysis and included reviewing the data and the potential biases in each trial before grading the level of evidence. None of the trials were graded as providing strong evidence primarily because of small sample sizes (even after meta-analysis) and the high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding, high attrition and unclear reporting of randomisation methods.</P>
<P>In adult participants with weight loss, balanced macronutrient supplements aimed at improving energy intake by 600-960 kcal/day increased intakes of energy and protein compared with no supplement or nutrition counselling alone, but had no effect on other anthropometric or immunologic parameters. This is an important finding as loss of appetite and consequent decreased food intake is common in people with HIV. The increased energy and protein intake in the supplemented group resulted in increased body weight in most cases. However, only in <LINK REF="STD-de-Luis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">de Luis 2003</LINK> was the increase in body weight in the supplemented group significantly greater than that of the group receiving nutrition counselling alone.</P>
<P>As all the supplements included micronutrients supplementation, it is not possible to determine if the observed effects of an increase in energy and protein intake are due to the combination of the macro- and micronutrient components or the macronutrient component alone. Variation in the nutritional composition of active supplements and in control interventions across studies, as well as differences in the disease stage of the participants in various studies (which can significantly affect intake and absorption of food) limits the value of meta-analysis and complicates the interpretation of the findings of this review. All the trials were of a 12 week or less duration making inferences prone to inaccuracies.</P>
<P>It is worth noting that patients with acute opportunistic infections are most prone to weight loss and theoretically this sub-group would be most likely to experience improvements in nutritional status such as weight gain. However, this sub-group was excluded from all of the studies evaluating balanced macronutrient supplements. Nonetheless, if the finding of increased energy and protein intake in our review is valid, this would be important, given that decreased energy intake, increased resting energy expenditure and accelerated protein turnover is common in people with HIV/AIDS.</P>
<P>In contrast to studies in adults with weight loss, balanced macronutrient supplementation did not have any effect on food intake, nutritional status or anthropometry in adults with assumed normal weight (based on results of one small trial, N=66).</P>
<P>A relatively large trial (N=1057) conducted in Kenya evaluated the effect of providing supplementary food to malnourished adults either initiating ART or pre-ART. Overall, malnourished HIV-infected participants not yet receiving ART (pre-ART) gained less weight than those receiving ART, regardless of supplement status (i.e. whether receiving supplementary food or not). Although there was no significant difference in body weight in the first three months of initiating ART between the supplemented and non-supplemented groups in the ART arm of the trial, participants receiving supplementary food showed a significantly greater weight gain and BMI gain (i.e. the change in weight and BMI at each time point in the first 3 months of the trial was significantly greater in the supplemented group compared to the son-supplemented group)than those not receiving supplementary food. This was evidenced by the significantly greater changes in body weight and BMI at these time points in the supplemented group of the ART arm. These effects did not persist after the first 3 months of the trial. The beneficial effects of supplementary food on body weight, body weight gain, BMI and BMI gain was more pronounced and more prolonged in the pre-ART participants than in the ART participants. At almost every time point in the first 9 months of the trial, pre-ART participants receiving supplementary food weighed significantly more and had a significantly higher BMI than the non-supplemented participants. Supplementary feeding did not affect CD4 cell count or serum albumin levels in either ART or pre-ART participants. Supplementary feeding had a significant beneficial effect on haemoglobin levels in both ART and pre-ART participants. In the initial stages of the trial supplementary food had a significant beneficial effect on the quality of life of pre-ART participants in particular.</P>
<P>In India, providing supplementary food to TB/HIV co-infected adult participants not yet receiving ART did not significantly alter risk of death at 6 months, TB cure rate at 6 months or TB treatment failure before 6 months compared to TB/HIV co-infected participants not receiving supplementary food. The provision of supplementary food did not significantly alter CD4 cell counts or viral load compared with values from the non-supplemented participants.</P>
<P>HIV infection is most prevalent in parts of the world where food security is compromised. These populations at high risk of HIV infection lack appropriate nourishment prior to infection by HIV. Poor nutrient status in HIV-infected individuals is an independent predictor of mortality in both untreated and treated individuals with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Marazzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marazzi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koethe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koethe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2011</LINK>). These two trials evaluating supplementary feeding in low-income countries are important as they provide some evidence of the effectiveness of macronutrient supplementation in these populations who are likely to benefit the most from such interventions.   </P>
<P>Four small trials evaluated four different specific macronutrient interventions so meta-analysis was not possible. In adult participants with unintentional weight loss of 5% or more supplementation with an amino acid mixture containing arginine, glutamine and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) significantly increased body weight and fat free mass and significantly reduced viral load. Various anthropometric and immunological outcomes were not significantly affected by daily supplementation with 10g of spirulina compared to placebo of green clay in malnourished, antiretroviral naive participants. It was reported that participants receiving spirulina had a significantly higher Karnofsky score and significantly fewer cases of pneumonia compared to the participants receiving placebo.</P>
<P>In adult participants with assumed normal weight, supplementation with monohydrated L-ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) did not significantly alter anthropometric or immunological outcomes compared with a placebo as both groups showed similar increases in all of the measured indices throughout the study. Although there was no significant difference in mean body weight between the groups at the end of the study, supplementation with l-glutamine and antioxidants resulted in a significantly greater mean weight gain over 12 weeks compared with placebo.</P>
<P>Three small trials were conducted in children. All of the trials were conducted in low- to middle-income countries, namely South Africa, Brazil and Burkina Faso. In children with prolonged diarrhea enhanced nutritional support (providing an extra 50kcal/kg/day, double the amount of protein and 5% more protein as a percentage of total calories than standard nutritional support) resulted in significantly greater weight gain after 8 weeks compared with the standard nutritional support. Attrition was high in both groups, mainly due to death of participants. It is worth noting that 43 children died during the 6 month trial. None of these children were receiving ART as was standard care in South Africa at the time of the trial.</P>
<P>The only notable result from the small trial evaluating the effects of whey protein concentrate in rapidly progressive HIV vertically-infected children was the significant reduction in the number of co-infections experienced by the children receiving the whey protein concentrate, compared to those receiving placebo. While this is a very important finding it should be interpreted with caution as this was a very small trial of 18 children and attrition was high in both groups (33% in whey protein concentrate group and 22% in the control group). All of the children were on some form of ART. In undernourished HIV-infected children the addition of 10g of spirulina to daily traditional meals did not significantly alter weight-for-height or weight-for-age z scores compared to the children not receiving spirulina. Compliance was excellent and there was no attrition.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-16 01:52:51 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two of the 14 trials included in this review evaluated the same supplements. Of those trials that evaluated similar classes of supplements, none of the supplements were identical in composition, formulation or quantity. Comparisons and control interventions also differed across every trial. The length of follow-up varied from 6 weeks to 12 months and few trials measured the same suite of outcomes. Due to this high degree of variation, it was not possible to conduct meta-analysis on most of the trials, leading to reduced confidence in the results arising from single trials. Stronger evidence would be gained from replicating trials of each of the supplements evaluated. This would also facilitate meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Earlier trials evaluated the effects of supplements on body weight and other measures of body composition, but few report on outcomes related to morbidity or mortality. While mortality and morbidity were not the primary outcomes measures of the more recent trials, the majority of them do report on these important outcomes.</P>
<P>Seven of the eight trials included in the original version of this review were conducted in high-income countries, in relatively well nourished (in terms of body mass index) adult males and females between the ages of 30 and 50, almost all of whom were on some type of ART. It is promising to note that all of the six new trials added to the review were conducted in low-to middle-income countries (four trial in Africa) and the interventions tested in these trials are relevant and accessible to the populations in these countries. The addition of three studies conducted in children is also noteworthy. There are major differences between HIV-infected individuals in rich and poor countries with regard to income level, availability of adequate nutrition, and access to basic healthcare or life-prolonging antiretroviral treatment. In addition, patient groups vary in terms of their response to the virus, stage of the disease, susceptibility and exposure to opportunistic infections, nutritional status, and individual response to the various treatments received. These observations highlight some challenges in applying the findings of trials conducted in high-income countries to people in resource-constrained countries, where nutritional status is generally poor and access to antiretroviral therapy is limited. In other words, where supplementation may be most needed.</P>
<P>Importantly this review identified only two potentially eligible trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kindra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kindra 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Horst-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van der Horst 2009</LINK>) which were conducted in pregnant and lactating women infected with HIV. Under normal conditions, successful pregnancy and lactation requires an increase in energy intake. In HIV-infected women, HIV-associated anaemia can be exacerbated during pregnancy. This review has identified that we do not have evidence from trials in support of macronutrient supplementation (either fortified with micronutrients, such as iron, or not) in this population.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> provides information on RCTs comparing two or more macronutrient interventions in HIV-positive individuals. While we did not include the results of these trials in our review we have provided this information for the sake of completeness. </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-16 01:48:02 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the meta-analysis of trials evaluating balanced macronutrient supplements fortified with micronutrients and nutrition counselling versus nutrition counselling we combined data reflecting both mean change from baseline to end-point and final mean at the end-point of the study as described in the<I> Cochrane Review Authors&#8217; Handbook</I>. Caution must be used when interpreting the outcomes of this meta-analysis as certain effects of the interventions may be hidden when combining these two types of data. Furthermore, the lengths of follow up of the trials included in this meta-analysis were also different (two trials had a 6 week follow up, one trial had an 8 week follow up and one trial had a 12 week follow up). This could also introduce bias into the results of the meta-analysis. Finally, the interventions evaluated in the trials were similar, in a very broad sense, but not identical.</P>
<P>Biases in the review process were minimised by performing a comprehensive search of the literature, independently selecting and appraising the studies, and extracting the data in duplicate. Where data was missing, we sought additional information and data directly from authors where this was possible to do so. We also consulted product web sites to gain more detailed product information regarding several of the commercial supplements.</P>
<P>Although an extensive hand-search for grey literature was not conducted, it is unlikely that important trials have been missed given the high profile nature of the topic and the close partnership established with agencies and organizations working in this area. Indeed, due to the involvement of the WHO in this review, the authors were presented with data from the unpublished FANTA-KEMRI trial. However, the review remains at risk of publication bias from less prominent trials. We attempted to reduce this risk by identifying relevant conference abstracts. A 2010 search of the HIV/AIDS-specific conference database, NLM Gateway, yielded two relevant trials, both of which were already included in the review. Given that NLM Gateway is no longer maintained, conducting an additional search of the new HIV/AIDS conference database, <A HREF="http://www.aegis.com">www.aegis.com</A>, could potentially yield unpublished studies and is warranted to reduce  the possible impact of publication in this review.</P>
<P>The search of the trials registry, <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>, to identify trial protocols and ongoing trials yielded 28 potentially relevant trials protocols. These will require further assessment and exploration to either 1) link them to trials already included in the review, or 2) if not included, to attempt to obtain the completed trial reports. This task is time-consuming and has to be balanced against feasibility and time constraints.</P>

There is limited evidence for the optimal type and amount of supplement delivered by food programme interventions for people infected with HIV.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-26 23:43:31 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>INTERVENTION:</P>
<P>Standard nutritional support consisting of a casein maltodextrin-based milk formula (AL110) until diarrhoea resolved and appetite re-established. Thereafter, amount of milk formula modified to provide at least 150 kcal/kg/day containing ~4.0&#8211;5.5 g protein/kg/day and 15% of calories as protein. Depending on age and weight of child, sometimes required addition of powdered protein supplement to other food. Enhanced nutritional support provided until child reached 3 months of age. Children randomised at 3 months to continued enhanced nutritional support received the same milk and supplements until 6 months of age</P>
<P>At home, caregivers were advised to provide their normal home foods and additionally give the milk formula and protein supplements as directed by the study dietician.</P>
<P>CONTROL:</P>
<P>Standard nutritional support consisted of casein maltodextrin-based milk formula with 67 kcal/100mL offered at least four times per day and a maize porridge/pureed vegetable/oil diet with fermented milk offered at least four times per day. This diet provided at least 100-110 kcal/kg/day containing ~2.2g protein/kg/day (9.5% of calories as protein) and total lactose content of &lt;3.2g/kg.</P>
<P>Children older than 12 months were offered predominantly soft diet of porridge and vegetable purees with an equivalent protein and energy content. This diet continued until discharge from hospital. The same casein maltodextrin&#8211;based formula was supplied to children treated as outpatients until the child had no watery stools and<BR/>less than four loose stools per day.</P>
<P>Following discharge no additional food support was offered unless a child required a specialised feed because of persisting carbohydrate intolerance. When household food insecurity was identified, caregivers were referred to the hospital social worker for assistance with welfare grants. During admission, outpatient visits and subsequent study visits a dietary assistant advised caregivers on food preparation, emphasizing a balanced diet and inexpensive but nutritious food choices, hygiene and advice for children with mouth sores or anorexia.</P>
<P>All children received daily vitamin supplements (A, C, D, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinamide and B12) providing approximately twice the USDA-recommended daily requirement for 2 weeks. Children also received folate 5 mg daily for 7 days, zinc sulphate 15 mg daily for 14 days and a single oral dose of vitamin A (6&#8211;12 months: 100 000 IU; &gt;12 months: 200 000 IU).</P>
<P>DURATION:</P>
<P>26 weeks</P>
<P>ADHERENCE:</P>
<P>The supplemental milk formula was provided in unlabelled tins, and intake was ascertained by examination of empty tins at follow-up.</P>

<P>INTERVENTION:</P>
<P>Mothers of children receiving spirulina (SP) were given weekly rations of 70 g of SP in a sachet. Each day 10 g of SP (measured with a graduated container) was added to the traditional meal (millet flour) of the child. This mixture was made at least twice a day (therefore children received 20g SP per day), was given to children in a quantity covering their caloric requirements, and outside the suckling time in children whose mothers continued to breast-feed. The mothers were instructed how to prepare mixes and feed their children at the Centre. After this they continued to administer the mixture at home. SP comprises~57% protein and ~6% lipid.</P>

<SUP>4</SUP> Both are small trials, Berneis only has 15 participants so results are likely to be imprecise.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> The meta-analysis included combining mean change scores from baseline to study endpoint (Schwenk and Rabeneck)and actual mean weight measurements at study endpoint (Berneis and De Luis) as described in the Cochrane Review Handbook.

<SUP>6</SUP> All four trial reports were unclear regarding randomisation and selection bias may be present. The trials were not blinded for participants and personnel possibly leading to performance bias. Blinding was not clearly reported for outcome assessment and detection bias may be present.

<SUP>8</SUP> The meta-analysis included combining mean change scores from baseline to study endpoint and actual mean measurements at study endpoint as described in the Cochrane Review Handbook. No fat free mass in % TBW was reported in the control group for Rabeneck and so we included the change score instead. In Schwenk it is not clear that the data presented are % TBW as they reflect the Area under the Curve. However the trial adds very little weight (0.6%) so we retained it in the analysis.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> The De Luis trial did not report change scores and so the actual mean weights are reported. In the control group this was 57.6kg<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> Berneis is a small trial with 15 participants leading to imprecision. As there is only one other trial in the meta-analysis imprecision is likely.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> Results are for one trial only with a high risk of selection, performance, and detection bias.<BR/>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>56 patients completed the study. Those supplemented with NEF maintained their body weight significantly (p = 0.04) better, had significantly (p = 0.03) more stable triceps skin-fold measurements, and had significantly (p = 0.04) lower blood urea nitrogen than patients consuming the SEF supplement. Consumption of the NEF supplement was also associated with significantly reduced hospitalizations during the 3- to 6-mo evaluation period (p = 0.02). The NEF supplement was well tolerated and did not result in untoward clinical effects. These data suggest that supplemental use of an NEF provides superior nutritional management compared with an SEF for patients with early-stage HIV infection.</P>

<P>Outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">
<P>This three-armed trial compared two formulations of caloric supplements: Peptamen comprised peptides and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and NuBasics comprised whole protein and long-chain triglylcerides (LCT), in patients with stable weights (no more than 5% weight loss in three to six months prior to trial). These supplements were compared with each other and with a control group of multivitamins and mineral supplementation. Both the intervention groups received the same multivitamins and mineral supplementation as the control group. Mortality was low in all three groups: one in the Peptamen group, four in the NuBasics group and three in the control group. Disease progression was also measured. For the combined outcome of disease progression or death, the authors report the raw data. In the Peptamen group, four participants progressed or died, 14 progressed or died in the NuBasics group and 12 progressed or died in the control group. We analysed the difference between the Peptamen and control groups in REVMAN and found that participants in the Peptamen group were not statistically significantly less likely to die or progress than those in the control group (RR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.11, 1.02; p = 0.05). See Analysis 4.1<BR/>
<BR/>The trial reports means and standard errors for percentage change for outcomes and not the actual weight change itself. We report the outcomes as reported by the authors in the text. For mean percentage changes in body weight, there were no statistically significant differences between the three groups with a mean % change of 0.8% in the Peptamen group, 1.1% in the NuBasics group and 0.7% in the multivitamin groups. Using analysis of variance the authors report a p value of 0.74 between the groups. Mean percentage change in body cell mass (BCM) at study endpoint was not statistically significant between groups using analysis of variance (p = 0.63). The mean percentage BCM was 0.7% in the Peptamen group, 1.2% in the NuBasics group and 0.6% in the control group.<BR/>
<BR/>Mean daily caloric intake was statistically significantly higher in the Peptamen and NuBasics groups when compared with the multivitamin control group respectively. Participants in the Peptamen group had a mean intake 325 kilocalories more than those in the control group (MD: 325.00; 95% CI: 79.66, 570.34; p = 0.009). See Analysis 4.2. Participants in the NuBasics group had a mean intake 238 kilocalories more than those in the control group (MD: 238; 95% CI: 11.58, 464.42; p = 0.04). See Analysis 4.3. There was no statistically significant difference in intake between the Peptamen and NuBasics groups (MD: 87.00; 95% CI: -142.89, 316.89; p = 0.46). See Analysis 4.4.<BR/>
<BR/>More participants in the Peptamen group (22%) discontinued the trial compared with those receiving NuBasics (7%). One third of the participants discontinuing in the Peptamen group did so because of diarrhoea and nausea. In the NuBasics group none stopped due to side effects. In the control group 5% stopped and a quarter of these did so for reasons of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.<BR/>

<P>Outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Both formulas were well-tolerated and there were no adverse effects on GI function or related symptoms. Evaluation of food and formula intake at 6 months revealed an increased intake of calories and protein in both groups. This occurred through supplement intake (500-600 kcal/day and 17-28g protein/day) which resulted in some decrease in spontaneous food intake (196-382 kcal/day and 5.6-14.45 protein/day). The net increase was approximately 400 kcal/day. REE was elevated compared to normal (110% predicted) at baseline &amp; did not change during supplementation. The response of fat free mass (FFM) at 6 wks was significantly correlated (r2 = -0.42, p &lt; 0.01) with baseline hepatic fat synthesis (an index of cytokine presence and metabolic dysregulation). A majority of patients maintained their entrance body weight as only 20% experienced reductions of 2.2 kg or greater. When considering all data from the 1 yr follow up, the risk of a &gt; or = 50% drop from baseline in the CD4 count was 7.4 times greater in the WP than the PB group (p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, total intake of nutrients increased even after reduction of voluntary food intake was considered. This increased macro and micro nutrient intake resulted in apparent weight maintenance without untoward GI symptom or function. Specific dietary management with the PB formula may provide added clinical benefit based on the CD4 analyses.</P>

<P>The two groups were similar at baseline. Dropout rates were high in both groups over the six month follow up. Both groups gained weight, on average, during the study. The LCT group gained significantly more weight than the MCT group (0.63 vs 0.13 kg/month, p = 0.016). In contrast, gains in body cell mass were small and similar in the two groups (0.08 vs 0.06 kg/month, p = 0.655). Subjects who dropped out before the four month follow up were more likely to have lost body cell mass during months 1-3 than those who continued on study.</P>

<TD>
<P>All participants had a BMI &lt; 18.5 at study entry. The trial reported mortality data. Overall 131 participants died with those in the fortified spread being no more likely to die than those in the corn-soy blend group (RR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.41; p = 0.74). See Analysis 7.1. Although 95% Confidence Intervals were reported, no p values were provided. We recalculated the analyses in REVMAN and report these. Participants in the fortified spread group gained significantly more weight than those in the corn-soy blend group (MD: 1.3kg; 95%CI: 0.52, 2.08; p = 0.001), had a greater gain in fat-free body mass (MD: 0.70kg; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.25; p = 0.01) and in mid-upper arm circumference (MD: 0.60cm; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.93; p = 0.0003). See Analysis 7.2; Analysis 7.4; Analysis 7.5. Change in BMI was also statistically significantly greater in the fortified spread group compared with the corn-soy blend group (MD: 0.6kg; 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.9; p &lt; 0.0001). See Analysis 7.3.<BR/>
<BR/>Change in mean CD4 count at study endpoint was not statistically significantly different between the groups. See Analysis 7.7. The authors report that viral load and quality of life also did not differ significantly between groups. The authors conducted further analyses stratifying the outcomes by diet quality on enrolment and the type of supplement. Neither of the supplements affected any of the three dietary subgroups differently. Adverse effects were not reported.</P>

<P>RESULTS:</P>
<P>Fifty-five patients completed the protocol. Compliance with and tolerance of oral nutritional supplement during the 6-month period was excellent. In both groups of patients the following were found: total energy intake was transiently increased and then returned to baseline level; nitrogen/energy intake ratio was increased throughout the study; gain of body weight and fat mass were approximately 2 and 1kg, respectively, over 6 months, and were similar in both groups. In addition, CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts, viraemia, tumour necrosis factor soluble receptors remained statistically unchanged and were similar in both groups. Enrichment of an oral nutritive supplement with arginine and omega-3 fatty acids did not improve immunological parameters. However, body weight increased in both groups</P>

<P>In energy-protein group: 37/189 lost to follow up and in control group: 35/188 lost to follow up. There were no effects on any outcome at 2 months, but energy&#8211;protein supplementation was associated with a 1·3 (95% CI 20·1, 2·8) kg marginally significant gain in handgrip strength at 5 months. At 2 months, there was an interaction between energy&#8211;protein supplementation and CD4 count level for weight (P<SUB>interaction</SUB> =0·03), which was explained by a 1·9 kg (95% CI 0·1, 3·7; P¼0·04) higher weight gain among patients with CD4 counts of 350 cells/ml or higher, and the lack of effect among those who had CD4 counts below 350 cells/ml (20·2 kg; 95% CI 21·3, 0·8; P¼0·66). Similarly, at 5 months, energy&#8211;protein supplementation led to a 2·3 (95% CI 0·6, 4·1) kg higher handgrip strength gain among patients with CD4 counts&lt;350 cells/ml, but not in those with high CD4 counts (P<SUB>interaction</SUB> =0·04). In conclusion, energy&#8211;protein supplementation to PTB/HIV-co-infected patients had no overall effects on weight and body composition, but was associated with marginally significant gain in handgrip strength.

<P>Outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In Sattler 2008 all analyses were performed using the WiIcoxon rank sum test for non-normally distributed data. The report also provided means and standard deviations and these were entered into REVMAN for calculations. We report the REVMAN calculations and the Wilcoxon rank sum test data as reported by the authors which are likely to be more accurate if there was a lack of a normal distribution for the outcomes. For daily energy intake, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean change in intake from baseline to week 12 between the whey protein and placebo groups (REVMAN: MD: -6.00; 95% CI: -637.57, 625.57; p = 0.99). See Analysis 6.1. The authors&#8217; analysis report a non-significant p = 0.12. For daily protein intake, participants in the whey protein group had a statistically significantly greater intake than the placebo group (REVMAN: MD: 1.17g/kg/day; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.54; p &lt; 0.00001). SeeAnalysis 6.2. This was also significant when analysed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (reported p &lt; 0.01).<BR/>
<BR/>For mean change in weight, total lean body mass and fat mass from baseline to week 12, there were no statistically significant differences either by REVMAN analysis or reported Wilcoxon rank sum test. See Analysis 6.3; Analysis 6.4; and Analysis 6.5. The authors do not provide final or changes in BMI but conducted an analysis correlating baseline BMI to changes in weight in either group and found no correlation (reported Spearman correlation: whey protein: -0.18; p = 0.36; placebo: 0.32; p = 0.12)<BR/>
<BR/>Mean change in triglycerides was statistically significantly lower in the whey protein group compared with placebo at week 12 (MD: -55.00; 95% CI: -102.62, -7.38; p = 0.02). See Analysis 6.6. This was also found to be significant when using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (reported p = 0.03). For mean change in CD4 count the authors conducted a Wilcoxon rank sum test and showed a statistically significant increase in the CD4 count in the whey protein group compared with placebo (reported p = 0.03). In analysis in REVMAN the result was not statistically significant at p = 0.22. See Analysis 6.7. Given that CD4 counts are known to be non-normally distributed it is likely the authors&#8217; use of Wilcoxon rank sum test is more accurate.<BR/>

<P>Outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in energy intake between the arginine-enriched formula group and the non-enriched formula groups (MD: -10kcal/day; 95% CI: -459.96, 439.96; p = 0.97). See Analysis 2.1. Body weight was significantly increased by a mean of 3.40kg and could be as much as 5.29kg or as little as 1.51kg (MD: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.51, 5.29; p &lt; 0.0004). Authors state that no significant differences between groups for lean body mass and fat mass but the numerical data is not reported. The change in CD4 counts did not differ statistically significantly between the arginine-enriched formula group and the non-enriched formula group (MD: -50.00; 95% CI: -151.73, 51.71; p = 0.34). See Analysis 2.5. Viral load is not reported as an outcome. Adverse effects: a high temperature was reported by two patients (one in arginine-enriched formula group and one in the non-enriched formula group), and diarrhoea was reported by two patients (one in the arginine-enriched formula group and one in the non-enriched formula control group), but the authors state that the differences observed were not significant between the two periods.</P>
