<P>There was 1 ongoing study listed in the review that the team had tried to get data for, but the pharmaceutical company involved did not respond. There was also one study awaiting classification pending full text retrieval. A search of MEDLINE and PubMed in October 2013 and October 2014 found one more ineligible study, so we have marked this review as stable. Our Trials Search Co-ordinator will run a new search towards the end of 2015 to re-assess whether an update is needed.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:06:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the feet that is easily spread and difficult to get rid of. This review compared different oral antifungal drugs (i.e. drugs taken by mouth), and it included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. There are several different kinds of oral treatments, and the trials we found considered all the oral drugs used to treat athlete's foot. We found terbinafine and itraconazole to be more effective than placebo. And we found terbinafine to be more effective than griseofulvin. Griseofulvin is a treatment that was developed much earlier than the new treatments, such as terbinafine and itraconazole; these newer treatments tend to be most evaluated. Trials of other drugs were not large enough to show differences between them. All drugs had side-effects; gastrointestinal effects were the most common.</P>
<P>In future clinical trials, larger numbers of participants are needed to test different treatments in order to produce more reliable data. Also, future research should consider the costs of the different treatment approaches.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:57:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 14:26:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 00:37:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.</P>

<P>Fungal infections of the foot are common in people of all ages and can either affect the skin (tinea pedis) or the toenails (onychomycosis). The tenacity and duration of the infection can differ depending on the site. The cause of the infection is most frequently a dermatophyte (fungus), which inhabits and destroys keratin (a protein found in the outer layer of the skin). Tinea pedis, which tends to be restricted to the horny epidermal layers of the skin, is commonly known as 'athlete's foot'. It is contracted from infected skin fragments from other humans and, in some cases, animals (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1996</LINK>). There are several clinical forms of tinea pedis, which can be easily confused with other non-infectious skin conditions, such as the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>interdigital tinea pedis, which is macerated and scaly in appearance and found mainly between the toes;</LI>
<LI>plantar type tinea pedis (moccasin foot), which is fine, powdery scaling on a background of redness covering the skin of the soles, heels, and sides of the foot; and</LI>
<LI>vesicular (bullous) type, an acute inflammatory condition, characterised by the formation of vesicles, pustules, or blisters. This can mimic foot dermatitis of various causes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The causative organisms (dermatophytes) are classified into three genera: <I>Epidermophyton</I>, <I>Microsporum</I>, and <I>Trychophyton</I>. For tinea pedis, the main agents are <I>Trichophyton rubrum</I>, <I>Trichophyton interdigitale (mentagrophytes)</I>, and <I>Epidermophyton floccosum</I>. <LINK REF="REF-Roseeuw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roseeuw 1999</LINK> found <I>Trichophyton rubrum </I>and <I>Trichophyton interdigitale (mentagrophytes</I>) were the most common pathogens in his European survey.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence</HEADING>
<P>Traditionally, prevalence studies of tinea pedis have been conducted in school children (<LINK REF="REF-English-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">English 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-English-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">English 1961</LINK>), sailors (<LINK REF="REF-Catterall-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catterall 1975</LINK>), and coal-miners (<LINK REF="REF-Gentles-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gentles 1957</LINK>). More recently, athletes and those frequenting public swimming baths or modern-day leisure centres have been studied. <LINK REF="REF-Gentles-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gentles 1973</LINK> examined a random sample of 10% of all bathers at a public swimming bath and found the overall prevalence of tinea pedis was 8.5%. The prevalence was higher in adults (17%) than in children (4%). <LINK REF="REF-Auger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auger 1993</LINK> investigated marathon runners and found a prevalence of 22%, with higher prevalence rates reaching 42% in the older age group (over 46 years). There is often a discrepancy between the methods of diagnosing tinea pedis whether by symptom (clinical) or microbiological confirmation (culture). For example, <LINK REF="REF-Gentles-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gentles 1957</LINK> found that 90% of the coal miners studied had abnormalities of the skin of the feet, but only 21% were proven to be infected. A recent study in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Merlin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlin 1999</LINK>) found that the prevalence of culture-proven tinea pedis was 5% in children, increasing with age from 2% in 4 to 6 year-olds to 10% in 16 to 18 year-olds (<LINK REF="REF-Merlin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlin 1999</LINK>). The increase in popularity of water-based leisure facilities prompted <LINK REF="REF-Detandt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detandt 1995</LINK> to compare the level of dermatophyte contamination on the floors of traditional swimming pools and subtropical swimming complexes. This study found that the floors of subtropical swimming complexes are more highly-contaminated with dermatophytes than the floors of traditional swimming pools. The study concluded that this was due to large visitor numbers, long opening hours, the complexity of construction, and choice of materials.</P>
<P>There is a clear trend showing that tinea pedis increases in prevalence with age, and <LINK REF="REF-Auger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auger 1993</LINK> reported that his survey of tinea pedis indicated that men are infected about four times as frequently as women. This trend was confirmed by the Achilles study (<LINK REF="REF-Roseeuw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roseeuw 1999</LINK>), which found that nearly twice as many men as women had fungal infections.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:58:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Before the late 1950s, only topical drugs were available. Topical drugs are those that are applied as a cream, spray, or lotion on the surface of the skin. Griseofulvin, the first significant oral (drug taken by mouth) antifungal agent, became available in 1958, and there have been many advances since then (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1994a</LINK>). Although widely-used, griseofulvin is only effective for dermatophyte infections, and it needs to be taken for long treatment periods. It is associated with relatively minor side-effects.</P>
<P>The azole class of drugs, the broad spectrum antifungals, were developed next. However, the first azole, ketoconazole, has been associated with liver damage (although this appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1982</LINK>)), and it is now less favoured as an oral therapy. The 1980s saw the introduction of itraconazole and fluconazole, which were thought to have increased potency, decreased toxicity, and a wider spectrum of action than earlier azoles (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1994b</LINK>). Azoles are fungistatic (inhibit fungal growth) and inhibit fungal cell development at a later stage. Terbinafine, an allylamine, was also introduced. This drug has a broad spectrum of antifungal activity and is fungicidal in its action, i.e. it destroys the fungal cell at a much earlier stage in its development than the azoles.</P>
<P>Another less recognised oral treatment is bovine lactoferrin. Bovine lactoferrin (formerly known as lactotransferrin) is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the secretions of some glands. It can be extracted from cow's milk. Because there is an increase in concentrations of lactoferrin at sites of infection during the inflammatory response, it is thought that lactoferrin is able to keep the iron bound, thus, preventing its use for bacterial proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Alderova-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderova 2008</LINK>). Lactoferrin and lactoferricin have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of <I>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</I>, which is a dermatophyte responsible for skin conditions such as tinea pedis and ringworm (<LINK REF="REF-Wakabayashi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakabayashi 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:22:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>The numerous antifungal products available to treat tinea pedis differ both in costs and length of treatment. They can be taken as tablets (oral) or applied to the skin (topical). Clinical trials have focused mostly on topical treatments; oral therapy is more usually reserved for topical treatment failures and chronic conditions. Oral antifungal therapies are only available on prescription whereas many topical treatments are available to purchase over-the-counter (OTC). Topical therapies have usually been the first-line treatment for tinea pedis. A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK> examined all topical therapies for tinea pedis and found that there were no significant differences in effectiveness between individual allylamines or individual azoles. It found that topical allylamines, which are available only on prescription, cured slightly more infections of tinea pedis than topical azoles or undecanoic acid, both of which are available OTC. The <LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK> review concluded that for tinea pedis the initial line of treatment should be with azoles or undecanoic acid, and allylamines should be reserved for topical treatment failures. However, tinea pedis can be resistant to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brautigam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brautigam 1995</LINK>), and topical treatments can be messy to apply and rely on the person complying with the recommended regimen.</P>
<P>The ideal oral antifungal compound for the treatment of fungal infection should be fungicidal so that the treatment can be of short duration, should give high cure rates, minimise relapses, be easy for people to take, and have minimal adverse side-effects.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:22:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tinea pedis is not a minor condition that will resolve if left alone or treated inadequately. Fungal infections are treated by dermatologists, general practitioners, and podiatrists. They are overwhelmed with large amounts of information, and a systematic review of the research evidence is needed. To date, the research evidence has not been systematically appraised and synthesised to answer the key questions set out below. This systematic review addressed the main research question as to whether or not there is an effective oral treatment for tinea pedis and, if so, which treatment is most effective. Further research questions were as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is there an optimum treatment duration?</LI>
<LI>Is there an optimum dosage?</LI>
<LI>Which intervention has fewest side-effects?</LI>
<LI>Does any one clinical type of tinea pedis respond better to a particular treatment?</LI>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:29:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (SB-S and SK) independently assessed each included study using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK> for details of the criteria on which the judgement was based). We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study. We resolved disagreements about 'Risk of bias' assessment by discussion. Where possible, where a lack of reported information resulted in an unclear decision, we contacted trial authors for clarification.</P>
<P>We presented our assessment of the 'Risk of bias' findings using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure, which showed all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight readers may give to the results of each study. We also aimed to present this assessment in the narrative of the review.</P>
<P>We classified trials as being at high risk of bias if they were rated 'high' for any one of three key criteria, i.e. randomisation sequence, allocation concealment, or blinded outcome assessment.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:30:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where possible, we presented the outcome results for each trial with 95% confidence intervals (CI).쟙e reported estimates for dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR).쟙e used the RR rather than odds ratio (OR) since ORs (when interpreted as RR) can give an inflated impression of the effect size when event rates are high, as is the case for many trials reporting healing of tinea pedis.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-10 17:31:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered trials that compared similar interventions for a meta-analysis. These trials were also subject to an assessment of statistical heterogeneity in order to decide whether to adopt a fixed-effect or random-effects model. A fixed-effect model is a mathematical model for combining the results of trials that assumes that the effect is truly constant in all the populations studied. Only variation within the study is taken to influence the uncertainty of results. A random-effects model is a mathematical model for combining the results of trials that allows for variation in the effect amongst the populations studied. Therefore, both within-study and between-study variations are included in the assessment of the uncertainty of results. Heterogeneity is caused by variability between trials in such areas as the type of participants, the length of treatment or follow up, dose or frequency of the intervention, quality of the trial, etc.</P>
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the Chi test (we considered a significance level of P &lt; 0.1 to indicate heterogeneity) and the I statistic estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I statistic estimate examines the percentage of total variation across trials due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Values of I statistic over 50% indicate a high level of heterogeneity. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity and in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (I statistic over 50%), we used a random-effects model. Where there was no clinical or statistical heterogeneity, we envisaged using a fixed-effect model.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 14:28:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For each trial we calculated the cure rates (the primary outcome measure) at each outcome point from the reported mycological results. The longest available follow-up, within each trial, was generally used in summarising the overall effectiveness.</P>
<P>We combined trials using a narrative overview with meta-analyses of outcome data where appropriate (in Review Manager 5). The decision to include trials in a meta-analysis depended on the availability of treatment effect data and assessment of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Individual trials with small sample sizes may not be able to estimate effects precisely. By combining the data from these trials a meta-analysis acquires the power to increase the precision of the estimate of effect.</P>

Although 3 trials showed a higher cure rate for terbinafine, only 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-DeKeyser-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DeKeyser 1994</LINK>), which used itraconazole for 2 weeks, demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favour of terbinafine (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.02; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>); terbinafine achieved a cure of 86% compared to itraconazole at 54%.</P>
<P>Performing a meta-analysis (pooling of data from trials) achieves a more precise estimate of the treatment effect; however, the issue of heterogeneity is important. In considering clinical heterogeneity, the trials should look at a similar pool of participants, the same clinical condition, and have similar treatment periods and length of follow up. These issues are initially assessed visually by the researcher and then tested for statistical significance. As there was no evidence of heterogeneity (I statistic = 0%) between the 3 trials with a common treatment length of 4 weeks, data for the final outcome measurements were pooled, using a fixed-effect model. This gave a risk ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), which was not statistically significant.</P>

<P>Fluconazole (50 mg/day) was compared with 100 mg/day itraconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Difonzo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Difonzo 1995</LINK>) and 200 mg/day ketoconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Fischbein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fischbein 1992</LINK>). Both trials demonstrated broadly similar cure rates of about 90% for all 3 drugs. There was no statistically significant difference between fluconazole and itraconazole (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) nor was there any statistically significant difference between fluconazole and ketoconazole (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). However, as there were less than 30 evaluable participants in each intervention arm, the trials were not sufficiently powered to detect a significant difference. In addition, the trial data were poorly reported by <LINK REF="STD-Fischbein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fischbein 1992</LINK>. It was not clear if the unit of analysis was the individual participant or the infection site, and attempts to contact the trial authors to obtain clarification were unsuccessful.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoharitanon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoharitanon 2005</LINK>) compared 3 different brands of itraconazole (200 mg/day for 2 weeks); 2 were generic brands and 1 was a new branded product. The study reported that there were cost implications, with the generic brands being cheaper<I>. 
</I>There were 133 evaluable participants, who were not allocated equally among the 3 arms. The trial reported that no statistically significant difference was detected between any of the groups (group 1: 11/18, group 2: 35/61, group 3: 27/54); these data were not plotted in a forest plot. It is worth noting that a cost analysis was not reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Griseofulvin versus newer drugs</HEADING>
<P>One small trial compared griseofulvin (1000 mg/day) with ketoconazole (200 mg/day), both for 4 weeks of treatment, and no difference in cure rates was seen (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1987</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). The trial had a total of 29 participants, which raises the question of a type II error (not detecting a significant difference when there really is a difference of magnitude).</P>
<P>Two small trials compared griseofulvin (500 mg/day) with terbinafine (250 mg/day) for either 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Widyanto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Widyanto 1993</LINK>) or 6 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Savin-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Savin 1990b</LINK>). Both trials showed that terbinafine had statistically significantly better cure rates, 100% and 86%, whereas griseofulvin achieved 50% and 33%. When the two trials were pooled, using a fixed-effect model (I statistic = 0%), there was a statistically significant difference in favour of terbinafine (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.44; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>

<P>All trials reported secondary outcomes, but differed in the format of presentation and detail.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical assessment</HEADING>
<P>We reported our secondary outcomes as an assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of the condition; these were exudation, erythema, scaling, vesiculation, pustules, crusting, desquamation, maceration, fissuring and pruritus, burning, rash, cellulitis, and pain. The trials assessed on average six different clinical signs and symptoms; most commonly, these were erythema, desquamation/scaling, vesiculation, pustules, pruritus/itching, and maceration.</P>
<P>This assessment was usually a subjective scoring system where the individual sign or symptom was rated as absent, mild, moderate, or severe, and given a score from 0 to 3. None of the trials reported that the outcome assessor was blind to treatment allocation.</P>
<P>The trials presented the results in several different ways making it more difficult to make direct comparisons but allowing trends to be identified. Most trials calculated the mean clinical score across all assessed signs and symptoms at a stated point in time. In contrast, some trials presented results as a percentage of the population whose score was two or less for a total of all signs and symptoms. In general, the average clinical scores tended to reduce as the cure rate increased.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measurement of recurrence</HEADING>
<P>Further outcome measures were considered, namely the incidence of recurrence of the condition and maintenance of a cured condition 12 weeks after the start of treatment.

It was also noted that where trials had a placebo arm, these participants also reported adverse events. In all trials, the most frequently reported events were associated with the gastrointestinal system, such as diarrhoea and nausea, followed by headaches and the occurrence of skin complaints, such as rash, dermatitis, and pruritus. Less frequently reported adverse events were those associated with dizziness, taste disorders, and respiratory infections. Nobody suffered side-effects that led to any long-term or lasting damage. None of the participants who were treated with bovine lactoferrin reported adverse effects; however, haematological tests were significantly different to baseline in the group treated with 2000 mg.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 18:14:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Tinea pedis is a common disease of the skin, and in the majority of cases, it is caused by a dermatophyte infection. A number of factors may have contributed to the growing incidence of this infection, including an aging population and increasing participation in fitness and leisure-related activities.</P>
<P>In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS), the primary care team, and the affected individual make treatment decisions. One of the key decisions is the type of treatment, because antifungal drugs are available in either topical or oral form. Most topical treatments for tinea pedis are available over-the-counter and as such, are accessible for self-treatment, as well as being recommended by podiatrists and other healthcare professionals. Oral treatments are only available by prescription, and they are obtained through consultation with general practitioners, dermatologists, or nurse prescribers. Many of the advantages of oral treatment regimens are obvious; they are less time consuming and thought to have better compliance. It is recognised that oral treatments are best suited in the case of either topical treatment failures or more chronic presentations of tinea pedis.</P>
<P>This systematic review addressed the main research question regarding whether or not there is an effective oral treatment for tinea pedis and, if so, which treatment is most effective. Further research questions were as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is there an optimum treatment duration?</LI>
<LI>Is there an optimum dosage?</LI>
<LI>Which intervention has fewest side-effects?</LI>
<LI>Does any one clinical type of tinea pedis respond better to a particular treatment?</LI>
</UL>
<P>We have tried to answer these questions in our summary of the results below.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 18:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>We included 15 RCTs in the review. Of the included trials, only 5 were published in recent years, with the other 10 trials having been published pre-1996. This is an indication that research into establishing the most effective oral treatment for tinea pedis does not attract a high level of current interest; another explanation may be publication bias.</P>
<P>We considered trials that compared antifungal drugs with a placebo first as it is important to establish in the first instance whether a drug is actually effective when treating the target disease. There is evidence that both terbinafine and itraconazole are statistically significantly better than placebo.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is there an optimum dosage?</LI>
</UL>
<P>The evidence from 1 small trial showed that terbinafine (250 mg) was statistically significantly better than itraconazole (100 mg) when given for 2 weeks. However, this trial result was based on a final evaluable sample of one third of the original number recruited to the trial. The trialists did not report the reasons for the loss to follow up. A pooled comparison of trials comparing terbinafine with four weeks of itraconazole showed no difference between the two treatments that reached significance. Two small trials comparing terbinafine (250 mg) with griseofulvin (500 mg) demonstrated significant evidence that terbinafine cures 52% more participants than griseofulvin.</P>
<P>No difference was detected between ketoconazole and griseofulvin or between fluconazole and either ketoconazole or itraconazole. As only 106 participants took part in these 3 trials, however, there is a real danger of false negative findings. Similarly, the only dose-finding trial showed no significant difference between giving fluconazole for 50 mg a day or 150 mg a week.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does any one clinical type of tinea pedis respond better to a particular treatment?</LI>
</UL>
<P>The two most common types of tinea pedis are plantar (side of the foot) and interdigital (between the toes). The type of tinea pedis was described in all trials except four, but no significant difference was demonstrated in the effectiveness of any one drug with respect to location. Therefore, there is no clear data that the type of tinea pedis is an important factor for the clinician when deciding on oral drug treatment.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is there an optimum treatment duration?</LI>
</UL>
<P>With respect to length of treatment, terbinafine is routinely prescribed for 2 weeks (250 mg daily), and the most commonly evaluated regimen for itraconazole was 100 mg for 4 weeks. No trials investigated pulsing itraconazole, which gives 200 mg of itraconazole twice daily for only 7 days and is a regimen that is being introduced into clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2000</LINK>). In all trials, terbinafine was given at the recommended dose of 250 mg per day, but the treatment duration for terbinafine varied from 2 to 6 weeks in the trials, with the most frequent being 2 weeks. Terbinafine prescribed for 2 weeks at 250 mg daily may be the optimum treatment period and dosage.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of oral antifungal drugs in treating secondary outcomes corresponded to their effectiveness in achieving primary outcomes. It appears that an antifungal drug's effectiveness in eradicating dermatophyte spores on the skin of the foot reflects the effectiveness of that drug in eradicating clinical signs and symptoms, such as scaling, pustules, itching, and burning.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Which intervention has fewest side-effects?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Twelve of the 15 included trials reported side-effects, with gastrointestinal effects being the most frequently reported. The lack of reported information about the types of dermatophytes surviving the treatment regimens evaluated in participants with positive culture at last outcome prevented us from making any conclusions about the sensitivity of different species to each individual drug therapy.</P>
<P>The measurement of recurrence is important. There is little point in finding a drug treatment that achieves a good cure rate if the condition reappears some weeks after treatment has ended. The trials in this review were disappointing with respect to achieving good follow up, with only three trials assessing the condition beyond three months. Ideally, the condition should be re-assessed 6 to 12 months after treatment has ended, and if findings demonstrate a continuation of the cured condition, this reinforces the effectiveness of the treatment. Whilst it is recognised that a long follow up adds to the cost of a trial, it is important that the most effective treatments be those that not only achieve good cure rates but reduce relapse of the condition. Long follow-up periods also increase the possibility of losing trial participants; five trials included in this review reported a decrease in the number of participants evaluable from those originally recruited to the trials. Concern must be expressed at any missing data that is not accounted for. Of course there is an ongoing discussion of whether it is relapse or re-infection that causes the infection to reappear. In the case of tinea pedis, it is a condition that can coexist with a nail infection, and unless both are treated together, the nail might well prove a source of reinfection for the skin. Whether it is recurrence of the original condition or a re-infection, preventative measures should be considered. Routine oral treatments for prophylactic use cannot be justified due to possible side-effects, drug interactions, and high costs; however, topical agents are a realistic alternative. <LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK> concluded that whilst allylamines (e.g. terbinafine) were slightly more effective than azoles (e.g. clotrimazole) for topical treatments of fungal skin and nail infections of the feet, the most cost-effective option was to treat initially with topical azoles and use topical allylamines for azole treatment failures. This would be a realistic treatment plan for tinea pedis.</P>
<P>In summary, terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and one trial demonstrated evidence to support the use of terbinafine over itraconazole when given for a two-week treatment period.</P>
<P>No other treatment regimen was shown to be significantly more effective. The quality of reporting of the trials was variable, and in general, the method of generating the randomisation sequence and concealing allocation was not clearly reported, with the result that the trials were at unclear risk of bias for these domains. A similar omission was the lack of blinding of outcome assessors, especially with respect to the assessment of clinical signs and symptoms as this outcome is, by its nature, subjective.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conflict of interest and publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Because it was necessary to exclude those trials that reported combined data for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin of the hands and feet, the data set used in the analyses was incomplete. Whilst we did attempt to resolve this situation (e.g. to request separate data for feet), we had no productive responses from any of the authors of the excluded trials. The omission of this data may leave true effects of treatment undetected. Missing data is particularly relevant in drug trials in which a conflict of interest may arise in trials as a result of commercial sponsorship.</P>
<P>In this systematic review, six trials clearly received funding or support from pharmaceutical companies, the sponsoring companies being Novartis, formerly Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (terbinafine) (<LINK REF="STD-DeKeyser-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DeKeyser 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savin-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Savin 1990a</LINK>), and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Four of these supported trials demonstrated a result in favour of the drug manufactured by the sponsor. Of the six trials not supported by a pharmaceutical company, only two showed significant differences between two treatment arms; the other four trials showed no difference.</P>
<P>Although drug companies did reply to our requests for information, no new trials were identified that had not already been located from the database searches.</P>

<P>Terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment, and terbinafine appears to give a significantly better cure rate for tinea pedis than griseofulvin. In addition, terbinafine may require a shorter treatment period, which is preferable for maximising patient compliance.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-10 18:15:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes.</P>
<P>Little information was recorded in the trials about the effectiveness of specific oral antifungal drugs on specific dermatophytes. Future investigators should be advised to report the types of dermatophytes cultured at the last outcome assessment for the proportion of participants not cured. Collecting and reporting this information would not incur any additional costs to the research funding body as microscopy and culture at baseline and follow-up is the primary outcome measure in most trials. In addition, the clinical presentation of tinea pedis should be clearly diagnosed.</P>
<P>Future researchers should be encouraged to report baseline information about the study populations' lifestyles, hobbies, and activities, since it may be possible to detect differences in the types of infecting dermatophytes associated with different environments. An evaluation of epidemiological factors in tinea pedis was not possible from the data extracted from the trials, but ultimately, these may influence the effectiveness of antifungal treatments.</P>
<P>It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data for preferably six months after the end of the intervention period to inform whether or not the infection recurred.</P>

<P>We have deemed this review as stable and no longer in need of updating. There was one ongoing study listed in the review that the team had tried to get data for, but the pharmaceutical company involved did not respond. There was also one study awaiting classification pending full text retrieval. A search of MEDLINE and PubMed in October 2013 and October 2014 found 1 more ineligible study. Our Trials Search Co-ordinator will run a new search towards the end of 2015 to re-assess whether an update is needed.</P>

<P>You seem to have restricted your review to Tinea pedis excluding Onchomycosis and LION study concerned mainly with Onchymocosis. However, what is the clinical or practical consideration to exclude onchomycosis when reviewing effective therapy for Tinea Pedis? Would the studies thus omitted not bring in important pieces of evidence to consider, as not cured infection of the toe nails will in the longer run lead to reinfection of the skin, perhaps after several months?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2012-01-31 16:19:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The LION study is not part of this review because the study compares two oral treatments for onychomycosis. As you observe our review is concerned with the effectiveness of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (Tinea pedis or athletes foot)and not oral treatments for fungal infections of the toenail (onychomycosis). The review considering oral treatments for onychomycosis is currently a published protocol within the Cochrane Library.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2008-05-23 12:34:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>You have chosen to divide evidence on treatments of fungal skin infections in at least three reviews (oral/foot, topical foot/nail, and rest of body). I can understand that, considering the amount of trials.</P>
<P>However, to make this division, you excluded trials that compare data for topical and oral treatment (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Barnetson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnetson 1998</LINK> and Lynfeld 1974). I think this consequence is quite unfortunate, because these studies may be very helpful to provide evidence whether indeed oral treatment is more effective than local treatment, which is generally assumed, as you also do in your introduction. Would it not be informative to include these trials in some way or some trial?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you for your comment. You correctly observe that the review of treatments for fungal infections of the foot has been approached in three parts by considering the effectiveness of oral treatments for skin infections of the foot, the effectiveness of oral treatments for toenail infections and thirdly the effectiveness of topical treatments for both skin and toenail infections. This decision was made by the review team and was considered to be the most appropriate way of answering the question of effectiveness. Another point taken into consideration was that oral treatments are obtainable by prescription only and therefore usually require a consultation with a healthcare professional, topical preparations on the other hand are available over the counter.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria of the review on Oral Treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot, state that only oral comparisons will be included, therefore any trial that compared an oral drug to a topical preparation would be excluded from the review.</P>
<P>I understand your observation that including the evidence on comparisons of oral and topical treatments may add a further perspective to the review; indeed this would have resulted in a review with over 80 included trails. As I have explained the decision of the review team was that oral and topical agents would be considered in separate reviews.</P>
<P>Thank you for your interest.</P>
<P>(Note from the Criticisms Editor: the Skin group would consider registering a review comparing oral and topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot)</P>

<P>Wer searched CAB-Health 1973 to December 1997 and Healthstar 1975 to December 1997. In addition the on-line versions of DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit were screened to January 2000. The Internet was searched, using the Yahoo Search Engine, to identify any further useful sources of information. The following podiatry journals that are not listed in the electronic databases were hand searched: Foot; Journal of British Podiatric Medicine; Journal of the American Podiatry Association. The British Journal of Dermatology has recently been partly hand searched and the results were obtained from the Cochrane Skin Group. A search for unpublished or unlisted studies was made by contacting all schools of podiatry in the UK with a request made for dissertation bibliographies. No studies were identified by this method. The pharmaceutical industry was contacted to request reports of further published and unpublished trials. Replies were received from several companies. However, no new trials were identified that had not already been sourced from the database searches.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. 쟙as the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based, and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</LI>
<LI>had extreme baseline imbalance; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</LI>
<LI>had some other problem.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</LI>
<LI>insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
