<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 14:59:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a chronic, relapsing mental illness and has a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about 1% irrespective of culture, social class and race. Schizophrenia is characterised by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and negative symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. Half of those diagnosed do have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. Current medication is effective in reducing positive symptoms, but negative symptoms are fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with adverse effects and the overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable.</P>
<P>Antipsychotic medications are categorised as typical antipsychotics (i.e. first generation: chlorpromazine, haloperidol, etc) and atypical antipsychotics (i.e. second generation: amisulpiride; olanzapine; risperidone etc) and both are the mainstay of treatment for people with schizophrenia. Zotepine is an atypical antipsychotic and the atypicals are thought to have a different adverse effects profile to typicals; in particular they are thought less likely to cause movement disorders.</P>
<P>We sought all relevant randomised controlled trials comparing zotepine with placebo and other antipsychotics but found very few. Zotepine may well be a useful drug, but currently data are sparse, and importantly this data emanates from a company with an interest in showing zotepine to be effective and safe.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Zotepine is a relatively new antipsychotic often used for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. It is claimed to be particularly effective for negative symptoms.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of zotepine compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>For the 2006 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised clinical trials comparing zotepine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia or other psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected these and assessed their quality. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). We inspected all data for heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The review currently includes 11 studies with 966 participants. Most outcomes were short term (4-12 weeks). We found no data for outcomes such as relapse, time in hospital, satisfaction with care and day-to-day functioning. Compared with placebo, mental state ratings favoured zotepine (n=106, 1 RCT, RR No 20% decrease in BPRS 0.44 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6) using the last observation carried forward method. For the comparison with typical drugs, limited data suggest that zotepine may be as effective as these older medications. Mental state measures of 'no clinically important improvement' favour zotepine when compared with other active drugs (n=356, 4 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 4 to 22). About one third of people in both the zotepine and control groups left the studies before trial completion. Zotepine may result in less movement disorder adverse effects than typical antipsychotic drugs. Trials have not highlighted clear differences between zotepine and other atypical drugs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Zotepine may be a valuable addition to the class of atypical antipsychotic drugs. However, more data from existing studies is urgently needed to increase confidence in the findings of this review. In addition to this, new data from well planned, conducted and reported long term pragmatic randomised trials are needed. Otherwise clinical use of zotepine will be based upon speculation of short explanatory trials for everyday practice.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 15:03:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Typical antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and trifluoperazine, are widely used as the first line treatment for people with schizophrenia, in both the acute and chronic stages of the illness (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1995</LINK>). However, the atypical class of antipsychotic drugs, most of which have been formulated relatively recently, are making important inroads into this approach (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-Mackenzie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood Mackenzie 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>). Atypical is a widely used term used to describe second generation antipsychotics which have a low propensity to produce movement disorders, sedation and raised serum prolactin (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwin 1994</LINK>).The pharmacological profiles of the atypical drugs have been described as either clozapine-like or risperidone-like, but with the inclusion of compounds such as sulpiride and zotepine this dichotomy becomes simplistic (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwin 1996</LINK>). There is some suggestion that the different adverse effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotic group make them more acceptable to people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1997</LINK>). Certainly, the adverse effects of the typical drugs, such as movement disorders and sedation, are problematic and can result in poor compliance with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-CWG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CWG 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking) seem more responsive to the typical antipsychotic drugs than negative symptoms (poverty of speech, lack of motivation, apathy and inability to express emotions (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>)). These can be very disabling and may respond better to the atypical antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1995</LINK>), although this has not yet been adequately established (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1996</LINK>). Atypical antipsychotics are more expensive than conventional drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1996</LINK>), but it has been suggested that if they do indeed reduce a person's need for inpatient services their use would result in a net reduction of costs (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>In treating people with schizophrenia, choosing the most appropriate, effective and tolerable antipsychotic drug is a key to maximising the usefulness of medication. According to recent treatment guidelines, both conventional/typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs may be reasonable choices in the treatment of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Zotepine is a dopamine D1, D2 and 5-HT antagonist with particular effects on the noradrenergic system and it is claimed to be particularly effective in negative symptoms <BR/>(<LINK REF="REF-www.psychotropics.dk" TYPE="REFERENCE">www.psychotropics.dk</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of zotepine compared with placebo, other antipsychotics drugs (typicals and other atypicals) for people with schizophrenia or related psychoses. </P>
<P>As secondary objectives, we proposed to investigate:<BR/>1. Whether people with schizophrenia described as 'treatment resistant' differed in their response from those whose illness was not designated as such;<BR/>2. Whether people having predominantly positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia were more responsive to zotepine than those without this designation; and <BR/>3. Whether people experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia differed in their response from those at a later stage of their illness.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We sought all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was only implied that the study was randomised, we included these trials in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see types of outcome measures) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then we added them into the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, then we only used clearly randomised trials and the results of the sensitivity analysis were described in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included people with schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders) however diagnosed. There is no clear evidence that the schizophrenia-like psychoses are caused by fundamentally different disease processes or require different treatment approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>). If possible, we excluded people with dementing illnesses, depression and primary problems associated with substance misuse.</P>

Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, we included trials if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B. </P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials. </P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We (MF, SM, PD, AMB, GG) independently extracted data and, where further clarification was needed, the authors' of trials were contacted to provide missing data. For the 2006 update we (MF and JR) independently extracted data and contacted authors of trials for missing data. </P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of data for any given outcome were lost to follow up. In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, we considered people leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect we did not add their data to trials with less attrition, but presented the data separately. </P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We also calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random effects model.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Normal distribution: Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous endpoint data before inclusion: i. standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; ii when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); In cases with data that are greater than the mean they were entered into 'Other data' table as skewed data. </P>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and endpoint and this rule can be applied to them. However, when continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values. If endpoint data were not available, we used change data, because the statistics used in Metaview are rather robust towards skewness. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic: For continuous outcomes we estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again, if heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random effects model.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Valid scales: Continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, we presented such data, but with a comment that they would likely be 'prone to bias'.</P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported endpoint data.</P>
<P>4.2.5 Cluster trials: studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. </P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>5. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented, primarily, by employing the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I-squared estimate was equal to, or greater than 75%, this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In such cases, we sought to remove outlying trial(s) and perform and report sensitivity analyses both with and without these outlying trials. Where no obvious outlying trial(s) could be identified we analysed and reported the result using a random effects model, which takes into account that the effects being estimated are not identical.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis. We also hoped to investigate whether there were differences between:<BR/>i. People with schizophrenia described as 'treatment resistant' and those whose illness was not designated as such;<BR/>ii. People having predominantly positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia and those without this designation; and <BR/>iii. People experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia and those at a later stage of their illness.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for zotepine.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of studies please see Included and Excluded Studies table. </P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded fourteen studies, mostly because they were reviews or non-randomised clinical studies. One study was an animal investigation and two other papers studied the physiological effects of zotepine on healthy volunteers. Three studies did not provide any usable outcome data.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>Despite considerable efforts we are still awaiting assessment of three Japanese studies. We are waiting for two studies to be translated and are still seeking one study.</P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We are not aware of any ongoing studies.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We included 11 studies with 966 participants. All included studies were randomised and double blind. One was sponsored by Klinge Pharma, five had company employees from Knoll Pharmaceuticals as named authors and one appeared to be undertaken by independent researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Most studies were of very short duration, lasting between six and eight weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> lasted 26 weeks but only met inclusion criteria for the outcome of leaving the study early.</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>Ten studies employed operationalised diagnoses of schizophrenia either by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual or International Classification of Diseases criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> used inclusion criteria of a baseline score of 4 on the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> a baseline of 3 on the CGI with a history of recurrence of illness within the last 18 months. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> only included those who had previously not responded to at least three weeks of treatment with two conventional antipsychotics in effective doses. <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> included those with a baseline score of 4 on the CGI. <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> included those who were 'overshadowed by lack of spontaneity' and excluded people in advanced stages of schizophrenia, psychomotor excitement, in sedative states, hallucinating, deluded or with sleep disturbances. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> included stable participants who had primarily negative symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK> included people with DSM III diagnosis of acute paranoid schizophrenia. </P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Most participants in the included studies were in hospital, and all of those in the <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> trials were also hospitalised. Small proportions of those in the other studies were attending outpatient departments.</P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> was the largest study with 180 participants followed by <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> with 159 and <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> with 126. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> reported power calculations, rarely seen in schizophrenia trials. <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> stated: 'so that a difference between treatment groups of 8.2 points could be detected in the change from baseline to endpoint in the BPRS total scores'; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> used an 8.8 change in mean BPRS total scores and <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> a difference in recurrence rates between groups from 20% to 50% could be detected with 90% power and 5% significance, although why so an exact 8.2 and 8.8 change is not mentioned. <LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK> had 40 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>, 94, <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK>, 85, <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> randomised 50, <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>, 40, <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, 30 and <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1991</LINK>41.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>Doses of zotepine in these trials ranged from 75-600 mg/day. We identified three placebo controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK>). When an active comparison was used the choice of drug varied. Haloperidol was used in low doses in <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK> (means 4.2 mg/day) but <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> used doses above 10 mg/day. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> compared zotepine with up to 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine, whilst perazine was the comparator drug for <LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK>(348 mg/day) and <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1991</LINK>(150-900 mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> used thiothixene as control drug at 15-60 mg/day. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> compared zotepine to clozapine (150-450 mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> randomised to six groups; zotepine was compared to two doses of risperidone (4 mg/day or 8 mg/day), one of clozapine (400 mg/day), one of remoxipride (400 mg/day) and one of haloperidol (15 mg/day).</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>4.6.1 Improvement: Definition of improvement varied. It consisted of an analysis of variance of BPRS or CGI scores in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK>). Kaplan-Meir survival analysis of time to recurrence was used in <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK>, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> used mean change in BPRS scores, although endpoint scores were supplied by the trialists. <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1991</LINK> both gave endpoint BPRS scores, but it is unclear how <LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK> defined improvement. The latter study made extensive use of graphs from which it is not possible to extract data. <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>, however, provided a binary report of 'improved or not' from their measurement of BPRS and CGI. <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> used a 50% improvement in BPRS scores as a measure of improvement. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> provided binary CGI data. </P>
<P>4.6.2 Missing outcomes: As most participants were hospitalised only <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported on hospital admission. Such short trials were also not focusing on clinically relevant outcomes such as quality of daily functioning, 'employed', 'trouble with the police', satisfaction with care. Unfortunately no cost data were reported. Just <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported on mortality.</P>
<P>4.6.3 Continuous data: Details of the scales that supplied usable data for this review are shown below. Reasons for exclusion of data from other instruments are given under 'outcomes' in the 'included studies' table. </P>
<P>4.6.3.1 Global state<BR/>4.6.3.1.1 Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The CGI is a three-item scale commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement. The items are: severity of illness; global improvement and efficacy index. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery. <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.2 Mental state<BR/>4.6.3.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0 to 126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. All studies in this review used a seven point scoring system. <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1991</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.2.2 Positive and Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale was developed from the BPRS and the Psychopathology Rating Scale. It is used as a method for evaluating positive, negative and other symptom dimensions in schizophrenia. The scale has 30 items and each item can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 =absent to 7 =extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates low levels of symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.2.3 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia; affective blunting; avolition-apathy; anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.2.4 Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale - MADRS (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>) <BR/>A 65-item comprehensive psychopathology scale was used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness. Ratings are based on 10 items, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3 Adverse effects<BR/>4.6.3.3.1 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale has been used to assess abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs, such as tardive dyskinesia and chronic akathisia, as well as 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term, drug-induced movement disorder. However, using this scale in short-term trials may also be helpful to assess some rapidly occurring abnormal movement disorders such as tremor. Scoring consists of rating movement severity in the anatomical areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk) on a five point scale (0-4). A low score indicates low levels of dyskinetic movements. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3.2 Tardive Dyskinesia Rating Scale - TDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1979</LINK>)<BR/>The TDRS exists under several names including: Simpson abbreviated dyskinesia rating scale, abbreviated dyskinesia scale, tardive dyskinesia scale. Thirty-four items are included in the scale rated in six steps of severity (1-6). There is also the possibility of writing in idiosyncratic signs so that no symptom (head, neck, extremities, body) is forgotten. The scale has been demonstrated to have good reliability and validity, and its sensitivity to change has been established. It is recommended as a suitable instrument for describing the breadth of tardive dyskinesia syndrome and also for quantifying the disorder. Higher scores indicate more tardive dyskinesia signs. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3.3 Simpson and Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>The SAS is a 10-item scale, used to evaluate the presence and severity of drug-induced parkinsonian symptomatology. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. The scale comprises of a 10-item rating scale, each item rated on a five-point scale with zero meaning the complete absence of the condition and four meaning an extreme presence of the condition. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3.4 Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale - DOTES (German Version <LINK REF="REF-NIMH-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIMH 1981</LINK>)<BR/>This side effect tool seems less of a scale, where the degree and severity of a symptom is recorded, and more of a checklist. The DOTES seems to record the presence or absence of a list of side effects. These dichotomous outcomes are then easily and usefully employed within a systematic review. <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3.5 COSTART Terms (<LINK REF="REF-COSTART-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">COSTART 1990</LINK>)<BR/>This is a list drawn up by the US Food and Drug Administration in order to help consistent description of adverse reactions. As far as the reviewers understand, it is not a scoring system. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.4 Cognition<BR/>4.6.3.4.1 Syndrome Short Test (Syndrome-Kurtz-Test) - SKT (<LINK REF="REF-Erzigkeit-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erzigkeit 1986</LINK>)<BR/>Descriptions of this published short scale were not available even in the studies that employed it. <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.3.5 Quality of life<BR/>4.6.3.5.1 Social Functioning Scale 36 SF36 (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkinson 1997</LINK>)<BR/>The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. The SF-36 includes one multi-item scale that assesses eight health concepts: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. The survey was constructed for self-administration by persons 14 years of age and older, and for administration by a trained interviewer in person or by telephone. The score range is between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating better health status. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>Four studies, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>, fall into quality category A (adequate concealment of allocation). The others were all category B as it was not clear exactly how randomisation had been conducted. The reader, therefore, is not assured that the introduction of biases were minimised at this crucial stage. It has been shown that poor reporting of randomisation increases the odds of presenting 'significant' outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Blinding to interventions and outcomes<BR/>Nine studies of the 11 included studies clearly described adequate precautions for blinding of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1991</LINK>). No included trial tested the adequacy of the blindness of those rating outcomes. </P>
<P>3. Follow-up<BR/>In the placebo studies 48% of people left early. In comparison with typical antipsychotics, about one third of people left before completion (see Results). In comparisons with other atypicals, it was only possible to ascertain from one study how many left before study completion (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK>). In this study there was 34% attrition which resulted in randomisation being broken and matched pairs being reported on. In <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> attrition was over 50% so only data for the outcome of 'leaving the study early' was entered into this review (see Methods). Reasons for leaving early were given in <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> but exactly why people decided to leave or were excluded from other studies was not made explicit. Once participants leave a study, unless the trialists continue to follow and collect data, assumptions have to be made about outcome. In ten studies data was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using the last observation carried forward. This practice may well overestimate the effects of treatment effect. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> used controlled, matched pairs and only reported on those pairs remaining in the study. <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK> only reported on outcomes which reached statistical significance. In this review those leaving the studies early were considered to have had a 'bad outcome' and analysed accordingly (except for the outcome of death). Whatever the management of lost data, interpretation of results with large degrees of attrition must be undertaken with caution. </P>
<P>The barely adequate reporting of randomisation, possible lack of double blindness for these outcomes and unclear reasons for loss to follow up would suggest that all estimates of effect of the experimental intervention are prone to exaggeration (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> found that the need for additional medications were similar for both the zotepine and placebo group with no significant differences found by eight weeks (n=85, RR 0.74 CI 0.48 to 1.14).</P>
<P>2.2.2 Not improved/worse (CGI scale)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> also found no significant differences between zotepine and placebo over eight weeks of treatment (n=85, RR 0.59 CI 0.3 to 1.1).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reports continuous results for the CGI scale by eight weeks. Using the last observation carried forward method we found the results favoured zotepine (n=106, MD -1.0 CI -1.5 to -0.5).</P>
<P>2.2.4 Hospitalisation<BR/>The numbers of people requiring hospitalisation in the <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> study were low: zotepine (0/39) and placebo (1/46) and we found no statistically significant differences.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reports BPRS endpoint scores by eight weeks which we found to be statistically significant favouring zotepine over placebo (n=105, MD -11.6, CI -18.3 to -4.9). <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported PANSS change scores that were not clearly significant (n=79, MD -4.9 CI -12.36 to 2.56).</P>
<P>2.3.3 Average negative symptom scores<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reports continuous data at eight eight weeks from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. We found the zotepine group did have significantly lower scores for negative symptoms than placebo using the last observation carried forward (n=105, MD -12.5 CI -22.7 to -2.3). However, again <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK>, using PANSS change scores, found no difference between groups (n=79, MD -0.9 CI -3.49 to 1.69).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> found the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores by eight weeks to significantly favour zotepine (n=79, MD -3.00 CI -5.7 to -0.3) compared with placebo using the LOCF method.</P>
<P>2.4 Behaviour changes<BR/>For the outcomes of agitation, hostility and nervousness, we found that data from a study of 106 people (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>) did not reach statistical significance, although all data did tend to favour those taking zotepine.</P>
<P>2.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>2.5.1 Any reason - by 8-26 weeks<BR/>We found significantly fewer people in the zotepine group (43%, 67/155) left the study early (n=312, 3 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.6 to 1.0, NNT 9 CI 6 to 48) compared with placebo (53%, 83/157).</P>
<P>2.5.2 Due to lack of efficacy - by 8-26 weeks<BR/>We found significantly fewer participants given zotepine were withdrawn or withdrew from the studies due to 'lack of efficacy' (n=312, 3 RCTs, RR 0.4 CI 0.2 to 0.7, NNT 10 CI 8 to 22) compared with placebo. </P>
<P>2.5.3 Due to adverse effects - by eight weeks<BR/>We found the data from <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> to be equivocal for people leaving the study early due to adverse effects.<BR/> <BR/>2.6. Adverse effects<BR/>2.6.1 Any adverse event<BR/>Adverse events were found to be similar in both zotepine and placebo group with no statistical significant difference (n=191, 2 RCTs, RR 1.38 CI 0.8 to 2.5) using a random effects model (I-squared statistic=88%).</P>
<P>2.6.2 Cardiovascular problems - pulse rate<BR/>We found no differences in pulse rates between the zotepine and placebo group. </P>
<P>2.6.3 Gastrointestinal problems<BR/>Fewer people taking zotepine suffered constipation than those on placebo but the result does not reach statistical significance. </P>
<P>2.6.4 Metabolic problems<BR/>We found no statistical differences for weight gain, or weight changes between zotepine and placebo from data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>. </P>
<P>2.6.5 Movement disorders<BR/>For the outcomes of akathisia, dyskinesia and needing antiparkinson medication we found no clear differences between those allocated to zotepine and those randomised to placebo. Continuous ratings were also reported and skewed data showed no clear differences between groups. Movement disorders evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> with The Tardive Dyskinsia Rating Scale also did not reveal any significant differences between zotepine and placebo. Extrapyramidal symptoms measured, by <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> using the Simpson and Angus scale, were equivocal. </P>
<P>2.6.6 Sleep problems<BR/>More people taking zotepine experienced somnolence than those allocated to placebo (n=106, 1 RCT, RR 1.5 CI 1.1 to 2.1, NNH 4 CI 3 to 29). We did not find rates of Insomnia to be statistically different, but the zotepine group did have lower rates of insomnia which almost reached statistical significance (p=0.06).</P>
<P>2.6.7 Others<BR/>On the outcomes of asthenia, increased salivation, liver function abnormalities and pain, we found no clear differences between zotepine and placebo.</P>
<P>2.7 Quality of life<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> reported on quality of life change scores using the Social Functioning 36 scale (SF-36). We found no significant differences on physical functioning, physical pain, perception of general health status, vitality, social functioning, emotional role function and psychological well being. Physical role functions (n=72, MD 20.6 CI 2.7 to 38.6) did significantly favour zotepine. The physical component scale of the SF36 almost reached significance.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2. ZOTEPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>3.1 Global state<BR/>3.1.1 Not improved (CGI)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK> dichotomised data from the Clinical Global Impression to produce an outcome of 'not improved'. We found no clear difference between zotepine and haloperidol (4 mg/day), but total numbers were small (n=30) and clear differences are unlikely to emerge. </P>
<P>3.1.2 Average endpoint score (CGI)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported Clinical Global Impression endpoint scores. When pooled these data significantly favoured zotepine compared with haloperidol and chlorpromazine (n=135, WMD -0.61 CI -1.0 to -0.2). </P>
<P>3.1.3 Needing additional antipsychotic/sedative medication<BR/>We found that no more people allocated zotepine were in need of additional antipsychotics or sedative drugs than those on 15-60 mg of thiothixene or 150-900 mg or perazine per day (n=175, 3 RCTs, RR 1.03 CI 0.8 to 1.4). </P>
<P>3.2 Mental state<BR/>3.2.1 No important clinical response (BPRS)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> pre-stated a cut-off point on the overall BPRS change score that they considered to be clinically important. We found the data favoured zotepine when compared with other active drugs (n=356, RR 0.77 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 4 to 22). </P>
<P>3.2.2 Average total endpoint score (BPRS)<BR/>We found data favoured zotepine (n=234, 4 RCTs, WMD -6.92 CI -11.0 to -2.8) compared with typical antipsychotics. </P>
<P>3.2.3 Average negative symptom endpoint sores (SANS)<BR/>We found that negative symptoms scores at endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>) were significantly different in favour of zotepine (n=132, WMD -8.7 CI -16.9 to -0.4) when compared with those allocated typical antipsychotics. </P>
<P>3.3 Behaviour changes<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> reported on anxiety, with or without irritability, as an adverse effect. We found no clear differences between groups (n=220, RR 0.92 CI 0.7 to 1.3). <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reports on hostility and nervousness as adverse effects, but again we found no clear differences between zotepine and the comparator group allocated to chlorpromazine.</P>
<P>3.4 Leaving the study early - any reason<BR/>The numbers of people leaving studies early were not significantly different 32% (77/239) in the zotepine group and 40% (93/238) in the comparator group. A funnel plot of these data shows no sign of asymmetry (n=477, 7 RCTs, RR 0.83 CI 0.65 to 1.04).</P>
<P>3.5 Cognition: No improvement (Syndrome Short Test)<BR/>We found that more people on zotepine exhibited an improved cognition as measured by the Syndrome Short Test, than people on haloperidol (outcome = not improvement, n=65, RR 0.32 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 9).<BR/> <BR/>3.6. Adverse events<BR/>3.6.1 Any adverse event<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> reporting on outcomes "any adverse event" found no significant difference between zotepine and haloperidol and thiothixene (n=160, RR 0.98 CI 0.9 to 1.1).</P>
<P>3.6.2 Cardiovascular problems<BR/>We found two studies reporting abnormal ECG results for those taking zotepine (<LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>) although only <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> reported specific data which were not significant (n=94, RR 1.44, CI 0.3 to 8.2). <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> reporting on tachycardia (n=94, RR 3.83 CI 0.9 to 17.1) with non-significant results. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported pulse rates which we found were not significantly different between zotepine and chlorpromazine. <BR/> <BR/>3.6.3 Gastrointestinal problems<BR/>Limited data do not suggest differences between zotepine and haloperidol or thiothixene for the outcomes of anorexia, constipation, or nausea. </P>
<P>3.6.4 Metabolic problems - weight increase<BR/>We found mean weight change (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>) in the zotepine and control group (chlorpromazine) were not significantly different. <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> did report on weight gain in those taking zotepine, but did not report its variance.</P>
<P>3.6.5 Movement disorders<BR/>Zotepine did produce less akathisia (n=396, 5 RCTs, RR 0.73 CI 0.6 to 0.9, NNH 8 CI 5 to 34), dystonia (n=70, 2 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.2 to 0.9, NNH 4 CI 2 to 56) and rigidity (n=164, 3 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.4 to 1.0, NNH 7 CI 4 to 360) than other drugs. We found that rates of dyskinesia, gait disturbance, parkinsonism and restlessness gave no suggestion of a differential effect of zotepine and the drugs of comparison. Rates of tremor were less in the zotepine group, although this did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=290, 4 RCTs, RR 0.69 CI 0.5 to 1.1). The suggestion that zotepine causes less movement disorders than typical drugs is supported by the data for use of additional anticholinergic medication. We found pooled results from <LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> favoured zotepine (n=221, RR 0.65 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNH 4 CI 3 to 8). Continuous ratings (skewed data) from the AIMS scale and the Simpson and Angus Scale did not produce any clear difference between groups.</P>
<P>3.6.6 Sleep problems<BR/>We found no clear differences between zotepine and chlorpromazine, haloperidol or thiothixene for the outcomes of insomnia, lassitude, sleepiness or somnolence. Data are consistent with zotepine being a sedating drug, at least as much as chlorpromazine.</P>
<P>3.6.7 Other adverse effects<BR/>We found asthenia, dry mouth or an increase in salivation, dizziness, headache, hyperhidrosis, nasal congestion and pain are equally prevalent in zotepine and control groups. Six studies reported the incidence of abnormal liver function tests. None of these abnormalities were stated to be serious and were no more common in the zotepine group than the control groups (n=430, RR 1.15 CI 0.9 to 1.4). </P>
<P>3.7 Missing outcomes<BR/>No studies reported on the medium to long term effects of zotepine. Data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, quality of life and satisfaction with care were not reported.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 3. ZOTEPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>4.1 <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> compared zotepine with clozapine in a group of people who were moderately unresponsive to antipsychotics. The <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> study compared two doses of risperidone, clozapine, remoxipride and haloperidol with zotepine. For this section of the review, haloperidol is excluded, and for continuous outcomes only data from the risperidone 8 mg/day intervention is compared with zotepine.</P>
<P>4.2 Mental state (BPRS endpoint scores)<BR/>We found one study (<LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK>) reporting BPRS endpoint scores with no significant differences (n=40, MD -1.30 CI -13.0 to 10.4) between zotepine and risperidone.</P>
<P>4.3 Leaving the study early: Any reason<BR/>Limited data were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> (n=50) and we found similar numbers of people leaving the study early between zotepine and clozapine, with no suggestion that either drug offers advantages over the other (n=50, RR 1.43 CI 0.7 to 3.2 in terms of treatment acceptability for people whose illness is moderately resistant to drug treatments.</P>
<P>4.4 Cognition: No improvement<BR/>We found no clear differences between zotepine and other atypicals (<LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK>) when cognition was measured using the Syndrome Short Test. </P>
<P>4.5 Adverse effects: Movement disorders - needing additional anticholinergic medication <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> reported that those allocated to zotepine needed anticholinergic medication more frequently than the atypicals group. We found data to be significant, although little were used in either group (n=135, RR 2.88 CI 1.2 to 6.8, NNH 3 CI 1 to 10).</P>
<P>5. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias <BR/>It was not possible to undertake the proposed funnel graph for publication bias or sensitivity analysis for people with schizophrenia described as 'treatment resistant', people having predominantly positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia and people experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability<BR/>Most studies were set in Europe and randomised people with operationally diagnosed disorders uncomplicated by co-morbidity. <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>, however, was undertaken in Japan. This study had such strict inclusion criteria that its results must be of limited generalisability. Other studies set in Japan await assessment. At this point it is unclear if these will add much to the data that has already been presented. We are collaborating with the Medical Information department of Orion Pharmaceuticals in order to acquire these data for a future update of this review.</P>
<P>2. Limited data<BR/>The review may be subject to several biases. Most trials from which data have been extracted are supported by the company that will profit most from zotepine being shown to be successful. Those studies are likely to have results favouring the experimental compound (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Heres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heres 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Data were often inadequately reported and rendered many outcomes unusable. In addition, only six to twelve week outcomes are reported in most of the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> was over 26 weeks but the rate of attrition was over 50%, so we were only able to include data on 'leaving the study early'. <LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK> had exactly 50% loss of data and we included the study. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> focused on cognitive functioning, but the only usable data we found were 'leaving the study early' as the trialists decided to break randomisation and manufacture matched pairs as the rate of attrition threaten the results. Two of the most recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>), were published in the year of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), which encourages high standards of trial reporting yet these trials only achieve a quality rating of 'B' (poor). <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> published nearly a decade before the CONSORT guidelines scored a quality rating of 'A'. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> were unpublished manuscripts and authors provided additional methodological data, which enabled us to assign a quality rating of 'A'. No studies reported on service utilisation, economic outcomes, or on satisfaction with care. <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK> used the BPRS and CGI scales but no usable data were available and no further information has been made available.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 1. ZOTEPINE versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>3.1 Death<BR/>No deaths occurred in the zotepine or placebo group during eight weeks of treatment. Unfortunately, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK>) reported this important outcome.</P>
<P>3.2 Global state<BR/>The need for additional antipsychotic drugs or sedatives did not reveal any obvious differences between zotepine and placebo, which is surprising given the placebo group were without treatment. People taking zotepine showed greater improvement than those in the placebo group, when measured as continuous CGI scores, although what an average shift of one point means in clinical terms is difficult to say. However, CGI scores that were dichotomised to 'not improved/worse' were equivocal (n=85). The result did show a trend in favour of zotepine and perhaps a larger sized study would have rendered this outcome significant. Participants requiring hospitalisation were only reported by <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> who found just one person from the placebo group required hospitalisation. Participants in this study were reported as being stable with primarily negative symptoms.</P>
<P>3.3 Mental state<BR/>All BPRS data are consistent and derived from one study (n=106, duration 12 weeks, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>). Trialists took the last observation and carried it forward, but this trial had considerable attrition which undermines the validity of the result, as it is difficult to say exactly where the best estimate of effect is. For the binary outcome of a 20% mean reduction in BPRS endpoint scores the result favoured zotepine over placebo (NNT 3 CI 2 to 6). <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported a statistically significant result in favour of zotepine for the BPRS endpoint scores (11.6 difference between groups). Again this is encouraging but difficult to interpret into clinically meaningful terms and in the light of the considerable loss to follow up. The measure of negative symptoms (SANS) also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favour of zotepine (12.5 difference in endpoint results), again using last observation carried forward. These data need to be strengthened by replication and use of more complete data sets, if possible avoiding the assumptions of the last observation carried forward. PANSS change scores were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> with all outcomes (total score, PANSS+ve, PANSS -ve and general psychopathology) being not significantly different between groups. Zotepine did significantly lower depression scores (MADRS scale) compared with the placebo group, and longer term follow up with a larger sample would have been useful to see if this effect is sustained. </P>
<P>3.4 Behaviour<BR/>Zotepine caused no greater improvement in occurrence of agitation, hostility and nervousness than placebo. This may be an indication that the study had insufficient power to detect real change.</P>
<P>3.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>Significantly fewer people taking zotepine left the study early (43%) for any reason than those on placebo (53%) from the three studies with an NNT of about nine. More people left the study early due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group, suggesting that zotepine is a more acceptable and efficacious form of treatment than placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999b</LINK> reported the highest dropout rate of 76% but did have the longest trial duration 26 weeks. The numbers of people leaving early due to adverse events was similar for both the zotepine and placebo groups. Long term follow up and larger trials are needed to determine if this is a reliable result.<BR/> <BR/>3.6 Adverse effects<BR/>We found no differences in the number of any adverse event occurring between zotepine and placebo. This was surprising given the known adverse event profile of antipsychotics. Data from the two included studies were heterogeneous and were analysed using a random effects model, and <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> shifted the <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> result towards the equivocal. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> suggested that zotepine did cause more adverse events than placebo with an NNH of about three, but adverse events were only recorded if they occurred five times. This means of recording may result in rare, but important, events being unreported. Pulse rates did not appear to be affected in the <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> study and zotepine did not cause constipation any more frequently than placebo. Zotepine may also increase in weight. However, the will to undertake an intention-to-treat analysis masks this finding in the data presented in this review. As more people from the placebo group were lost to follow up and the 'Methods' of this review state that those who leave early were to be attributed the negative outcome, the five in the zotepine group who were reported to have a gain in weight were masked by the assumed gain in weight in the placebo group. Rather surprisingly high proportions of those taking placebo needed anticholinergics and modest movement disorders were common in both groups, although using intention to treat analyses may have increased this. Continuous data measuring movement disorders (TDRS, SAS) were equivocal. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> suggests that zotepine may have an adverse effect of sedation (NNH 4). Other reported adverse events, asthenia, liver function, pain and salivation were similar for both the zotepine and placebo groups.</P>
<P>3.7 Quality of Life<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2004</LINK> used the SF-36 scale to record quality of life with most components from the scale being equivocal. The component 'physical role functions' was significantly in favour of zotepine, although confidence intervals were wide and conclusions problematic.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 2. ZOTEPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>4.1 Global state <BR/>The Clinical Global Impression scores were reported in ten trials, but only two reported the standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>), and therefore in a form that is useful for this review. The CGI continuous data did significantly favour zotepine, although binary outcomes 'not improved' were equivocal. It is unfortunate that other studies did not produce a binary outcome from this simple scale. Although there is a suggestion of improvement from CGI ratings, perhaps the overall improvement in global state or functioning is not great since the zotepine group did require similar additional antipsychotics to the control group on 15-60 mg of thiothixene, or 150-900 mg perazine per day.</P>
<P>4.2 Mental state<BR/>Whereas most studies did not report binary outcomes for global improvement they did for mental state (4 RCTs). All findings tend to favour zotepine. For the outcome of 'no important improvement in mental state' the number needed to treat is seven (n=356). Overall, what data there are suggests that zotepine is as effective as the typical drugs for mental state outcomes.</P>
<P>Four studies reported scores on the BPRS, whilst two (<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>) also presented data from a measure of negative symptoms (SANS). The results statistically significantly favoured zotepine for the general mental state score (BPRS), with only a seven point average difference between groups. The SANS averaged a nine point difference between groups in favour of zotepine which is intriguing. Neither the BPRS or the SANS are 'interval' scales where a ten point decline for someone starting with a score of 90 means the same as the same decline for a person whose initial rating was 20. It is therefore difficult to interpret this finding for clinical use. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>) claimed superiority for zotepine in treating negative symptoms, but did not demonstrate this by reporting data. Much larger studies are needed to replicate these mental state findings. </P>
<P>4.3 Behaviour changes<BR/>We found two studies reporting the mental state outcome of anxiety - with or without irritability (<LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>) as an adverse effect. No clear differences were found between groups (n=220, RR 0.92 CI 0.7 to 1.3). We are unclear where to present these findings as they relate to mental state but are labelled by trialists as adverse effects who did not state whether they considered zotepine had failed to control the natural anxiety of the study participants or whether the experimental compound caused the anxiety. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reports on hostility and nervousness as adverse effects. Again these are presented within this outcome. Zotepine is not different to chlorpromazine for these effects.</P>
<P>4.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>As a proxy measure of study acceptability, seven of the nine trials provided data on leaving the study early (<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1991</LINK>). Leaving the study early zotepine (32%) and typicals (39%) were not significantly different. The figure of about 32% is likely to be higher than that seen in clinical practice due to the need to rigorously adhere to trial protocols. Although this may improve internal validity, it can decrease the generalisability (external validity) of the results. That a funnel plot of these data shows no sign of asymmetry may suggest that there is no overt identification of studies that present potentially biased data.</P>
<P>4.5 Cognition<BR/>Measures of cognition using the Syndrome Short Test did significantly favour the zotepine group when dichotomised to not improved. Despite efforts we have been unable to find good data on what this may mean from the clinical perspective. Nevertheless, with the increasing emphasis on the cognitive decline associated with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Pantelis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pantelis 1997</LINK>) this is an interesting finding, worthy of replication with zotepine and other compounds.</P>
<P>4.6 Adverse effects<BR/>Only three studies report data in a usable format for any adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Dieterle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dieterle 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>). No differences were found between zotepine when compared to haloperidol, perazine and thiothixene. It is difficult to understand what this outcome means in the clinical situation and other data are needed to provide more useful information. </P>
<P>Studies report abnormal ECG results for those taking zotepine (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported that ECG abnormalities were found in both groups but gave no data. Only <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> presents usable data and neither the incidence of ECG abnormalities nor tachycardia differ between zotepine and thiothixene. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> also found equivocal results for changes in pulse rates. An intention-to-treat analysis is used in this review. Those who dropped out of the studies are added into the numbers of those who experience adverse side effects, which could give an overly pessimistic incidence. However, with only 94 randomised in the <LINK REF="STD-Sarai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sarai 1987</LINK> trial, and both results suggesting the negative outcome for zotepine, these findings are in urgent need of replication with clear reporting of findings.</P>
<P>There were no clear differences between zotepine and chlorpromazine, haloperidol or thiothixene for the outcomes of anorexia, constipation, or nausea. Forty percent of those on zotepine complained of constipation. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999a</LINK> reported weight increase and found no clear difference between zotepine and chlorpromazine. <LINK REF="STD-Petit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petit 1996</LINK> also reported a mean increase in weight gain of those taking zotepine, but did not provide a standard deviation. This important adverse effect is consistently poorly or under-reported (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Zotepine does seem to produce less movement disorders than the comparison drugs. There are clearly lower rates of akathisia, dystonia and rigidity and tremors are somewhat less prevalent. Rates of dyskinesia, gait disturbance, parkinsonism and restlessness, however, gave no suggestion of a differential effect of zotepine and the control drugs. The suggestion that zotepine causes less movement disorders than typical drugs is supported by the data on use of additional anticholinergic medication and this is even the case when the dose of control drug is low (<LINK REF="STD-Barnas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnas 1987</LINK>). </P>
<P>Zotepine is not clearly more sedating than haloperidol or thiothixene. The data, however, do consistently fall on the relevant sides of the line of no effect for the outcomes of insomnia and sedation to suggest that it does have some moderate sedating properties. Other effects such as dry mouth, dizziness, headache, hyperhidrosis and nasal congestion are equally prevalent in both groups, although the latter did look more common in the zotepine group. Six studies reported the incidence of abnormal liver function tests. None of these abnormalities were stated to be serious and were equally prevalent in both experimental and control groups. </P>
<P>4.7 Missing outcomes<BR/>In these short-term explanatory studies data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, quality of life and satisfaction with care were not recorded. The medium or long term effects of zotepine are currently unknown and are in urgent need of investigation.</P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 3. ZOTEPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>5.1 General<BR/>If zotepine is to make inroads into an increasingly competitive atypical antipsychotic market it will have to be compared more frequently to its close sibling compounds. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK> (n=50) compared it to clozapine in a moderately treatment resistant population and <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1996</LINK> (n=135) compared it with risperidone, clozapine and remoxipride. Very little satisfactory data were available.</P>
<P>5.2 Mental state<BR/>Endpoint mental state scores (BPRS) between zotepine and 8 mg/day of risperidone did not reveal any clear difference (n=40), although larger sample sizes would have provided more confidence of any treatment effects being detected.</P>
<P>5.3 Leaving the study early <BR/>Limited data show no differences between clozapine and zotepine for leaving the study early.</P>
<P>5.4 Cognition<BR/>Cognitive testing data were also equivocal.</P>
<P>5.5 Adverse events<BR/>Interestingly, the control groups experienced significantly less movement disorders than those on zotepine (NNH 3). These small trials are in urgent need of replication.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>All data for this compound relate to a treatment period of six to twelve weeks. Zotepine seems more effective than placebo and is at least as effective and acceptable as other drugs prescribed for those with schizophrenia. Zotepine may have an effect on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and it is less likely to cause movement disorders than typical drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine although its sedative properties may be similar. Data from studies comparing zotepine with other atypical drugs is currently too sparse to be informative. </P>
<P>2. Clinicians<BR/>Further studies are needed using pragmatic and clinically meaningful trial methods that cover longer periods before clear clinical recommendations can be made regarding the use of zotepine. Zotepine does show some advantage when compared with typical antipsychotics when measured by the BPRS and SANS and in avoiding movement disorders.</P>
<P>3. Managers or policy makers<BR/>No data relating to service utilisation, functioning in society and economics were reported. If zotepine is to gain wide acceptance future studies should address these important outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>Clear and strict adherence to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) for all outcomes would have resulted in this review being more informative. Denominator data were not always clearly presented and some results were described as 'significant' or not, but numbers were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meyer_x002d_Lindberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer-Lindberg 1996</LINK>). Authors should present raw data. If p-values are used, the exact value and specific test should be reported.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>Better planned, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials of longer duration are needed to address clinically relevant outcomes. Data relating to mental state and behaviour need replication and expansion. High quality trial-derived data relating to hospital admission, satisfaction with care, social functioning, family burden and employment would be of interest (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
