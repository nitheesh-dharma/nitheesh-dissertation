<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-17 20:30:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease caused by pertussis bacteria and may lead to death, particularly in infants less than 12 months of age. Although it can be prevented by routine vaccination, it still affects many people. Thirteen trials involving 2197 participants were included in this review. We found that several antibiotic treatments were equally effective in eliminating the bacteria infecting patients, but they did not alter the clinical outcome. There was insufficient evidence to decide whether there is benefit for treating healthy contacts. Side effects were reported with antibiotics and they varied from one antibiotic to another. The result of the review should be interpreted with caution since this review is based on a limited number of trials and some of these trials involved small numbers of participants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-17 20:31:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whooping cough is an acute respiratory tract infection, first described in the 1500s and endemic in Europe by the 1600s. <I>Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis)</I> is the sole cause of epidemic whooping cough and the usual cause of sporadic pertussis. <I>Bordetella parapertussis (B. parapertussis)</I> accounts for 5% of isolates of <I>Bordetella </I>species in the United States and characteristically causes a less protracted illness (<LINK REF="REF-Heininger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heininger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Long-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whooping cough epidemics in the pre-vaccine era (that is, before the mid-1940s) occurred at two to five-year intervals and these cycles have continued in the vaccine era. Although immunisation has controlled the disease, it has not reduced the transmission of the organism in the population (<LINK REF="REF-Cherry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 1984</LINK>). <I>B. pertuss</I>is can be prevented by vaccination and since the introduction of routine childhood immunisation whooping cough morbidity and mortality have declined markedly (<LINK REF="REF-Cherry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 1984</LINK>). However, despite widespread vaccination the disease has not been eradicated and an increased incidence rate has been reported in the last two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Isacson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isacson 1993</LINK>). There are 20 to 40 million cases of whooping cough annually worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Ninety percent of cases occur in low-income countries and result in an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 fatalities annually (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although adults and older children usually have mild or moderate symptoms, infants younger than six months of age, who are not old enough to have received three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, and incompletely vaccinated preschool children are at high risk of severe disease and complications including death (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whooping cough is highly contagious. Between 70% and 100% of susceptible household members and between 50% and 80% of susceptible school contacts become infected following exposure to an acute case (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 1996</LINK>). Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the years 1997 to 2000 showed that among 29,048 persons with whooping cough, 8390 (29%) were aged less than one year; 3359 (12%) were aged one to four years; 2835 (10%) were aged five to nine years; 8529 (29%) were aged 10 to 19 years; and 5935 (20%) were aged over 20 years old. The average annual incidence rates were highest among infants aged less than one year (55.5 cases per 100,000 population). They were lower in children aged one to four years (5.5 cases/100,000), children aged five to nine years (3.6 cases/100,000), individuals aged 10 to 19 years (5.5 cases/100,000), and individuals aged over 20 years old (0.8 cases/100,000) (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2002</LINK>). The incubation period is thought to be seven to 10 days (range four to 21 days) and, rarely, may be as long as 42 days (<LINK REF="REF-Heininger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heininger 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since 1976, reported cases of pertussis in the United States have increased, with a substantial rise among persons aged 10 to 19 years old (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed cases make up a substantial proportion of the total number of reported cases in this age group. Exactly how the increase in reported pertussis cases in adolescents reflects a true change in the burden of disease remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whooping cough is characterised by spasms of severe coughing (paroxysms). The paroxysms are continuous without inspiration until the end and are often followed by the characteristic inspiratory whoop or post-tussive vomiting or both. The illness onset is insidious, with symptoms similar to those of a minor upper respiratory infection (that is, a catarrhal period). During the first one to two weeks of the illness, coryza (a head cold) with an intermittent non-productive cough is common. This phase is followed by episodes of paroxysmal coughing which frequently last for several weeks (that is, paroxysmal phase). The disease peaks in severity after one or more weeks of paroxysmal coughing and begins to taper off with an extensive convalescent period of two to six weeks; convalescence may last up to three months in some cases.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-23 07:55:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whooping cough may cause severe illness in young infants and result in complications such as apnoea, cyanosis, feeding difficulties, pneumonia and encephalopathy. Infants and other patients with severe whooping cough may require hospitalisation for supportive care; for very severe cases, intensive care facilities may be required. Corticosteroids and albuterol (a B2-adrenergic stimulant) may be effective in reducing paroxysms of coughing but further evaluation is required before their use can be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Bettiol-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bettiol 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broomhall-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broomhall 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical studies have used erythromycin estolate, erythromycin ethylsuccinate or erythromycin stearate for treatment in patients with whooping cough or for prophylaxis. The studies using erythromycin estolate 40 to 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses have reported elimination of <I>B. pertussis</I> from the nasopharynx within seven days and no clinical relapses (<LINK REF="STD-Bass-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Bass 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Islur-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Islur 1975</LINK>). In contrast, studies with erythromycin ethylsuccinate 50 to 55 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Halsey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halsey 1980</LINK>) or erythromycin stearate 40 to 50 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1981</LINK>) have reported delay or failure of bacterial eradication, or apparent failure of prophylaxis, in 10% to 30% of cases. This has been explained in part by a higher serum and tissue concentration of the drug achieved following administration of the estolate preparation compared with other esters (<LINK REF="REF-Bass-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bass 1985</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-05-17 20:31:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The CDC recommends erythromycin for treatment of whooping cough and contact prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>). The recommended dose of erythromycin for use in treatment of whooping cough in children is 40 to 50 mg/kg per day (maximum 2 g/day) and in adults 1 to 2 g/day orally in four divided doses for 14 days. Some experts recommend the use of erythromycin estolate because it achieves higher serum levels compared to erythromycin ethylsuccinate or stearate when equal doses are given (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 1986</LINK>). The antimicrobial agents and dosages used for chemoprophylaxis of contacts are the same as those recommended for treatment of clinical cases (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The gastrointestinal side effects of erythromycin limit its usefulness in some patients. The erythromycin estolate preparation Ilosone is no longer available in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2002</LINK>) and possibly in other parts of the world, due to discontinuation of manufacture of the drug.</P>
<P>The newly developed macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may be superior to erythromycin because of improved absorption, a longer half-life, good in vitro activity against <I>B. pertussis</I> and a better side effect profile (<LINK REF="STD-Aoyama-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Aoyama 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>). Roxithromycin has not been well studied in the treatment of whooping cough. Based on a few studies, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) also appears to be effective in eradicating <I>B. pertussis</I> and it is currently recommended as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate erythromycin (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1991</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-08-21 13:07:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The recommended therapy for treatment of and prophylaxis against whooping cough infection is inconvenient and prolonged and it is likely that compliance is often poor (<LINK REF="REF-CDI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDI 1997</LINK>). The optimal duration of treatment is uncertain (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoppe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoppe 1988</LINK>). There is also some controversy as to whether prophylaxis of contacts is effective and, therefore, worthwhile (<LINK REF="REF-De-Serres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Serres 1995</LINK>). To date, there has not been a systematic review of the literature regarding the antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough.</P>

<P>The inclusion of studies in this systematic review was influenced mainly by the method of allocation concealment. Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Indeed, concealment has been found to be more important in preventing bias than other components of allocation such as the generation of the allocation sequence (for example, computer, random number table or alternation). Thus studies can be judged on the method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) highlights that involvement of at least two review authors to conduct a systematic review has an important effect on reducing the possibility that relevant reports will be discarded and may also limit bias, minimise errors and improve reliability of findings.</P>

<P>We excluded seven trials from this review. These trials might have provided some useful information if they were included (for example, efficacy of antibiotics used and occurrence of side effects). On the other hand, these studies had many methodological errors including the use of historical control patients, large numbers of dropout participants, poor quality methods or analysis and non-interpretable results. Inclusion of such studies might lead to several forms of bias (for example, performance bias, attrition bias) and hence misleading conclusions. Management of secondary respiratory infections in patients with whooping cough was not part of the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Intervention with symptomatic drugs such as steroids, bronchodilators and cough syrups for whooping cough was also not part of the inclusion criteria as another Cochrane Review on symptomatic treatment in whooping cough is has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Bettiol-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bettiol 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical cure (complete remission)/improvement</HEADING>
<P>Clinical cure/improvement was worded and defined differently between studies, therefore, we analysed results separately for each study and according to the definition used by the trial authors. In the trial by Hoppe (<LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>) clinical cure (according to parents' judgement after the completion of antimicrobial treatment and as compared with the onset) was 4/97 (4%) in the erythromycin ethylsuccinate (14 days) group and 13/92 (14%) in the erythromycin estolate (14 days) group. The results showed that erythromycin estolate was superior to erythromycin ethylsuccinate (RR 3.43; 95% CI 1.16 to 10.13) (Analysis 1.2.1). Clinical improvement after one week of treatment was not statistically different when tetracycline was compared to trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (<LINK REF="STD-Adcock-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Adcock 1972</LINK>). Decreased frequency of cough at 14 days of treatment was reported by Hoppe (<LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>) and was 72/97 (74%) in the erythromycin ethylsuccinate (14 days) and 72/92 (78%) in the erythromycin estolate (14 days) group with no statistically significant difference between these two esters (i.e. erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin estolate).</P>
<P>The presence of any signs or symptoms of whooping cough at the completion of treatment was similar whether participants were treated with erythromycin estolate for seven or 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>). Clinical outcomes in the study by Degn (<LINK REF="STD-Degn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Degn 1981</LINK>) were not possible to analyse since tables were reported as medians. However, the clinical course of the disease as estimated by the number of bouts of coughing per day was identical in the two groups. The clinical course of illness in the study by Bass (<LINK REF="STD-Bass-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Bass 1969</LINK>) was presented per individual patients and it was not possible to analyse these data accurately. However, the author reported that there was no significant difference in the subsequent course of illness in those groups receiving antimicrobial therapy when compared with the untreated control group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Microbiological eradication</HEADING>
<P>Microbiological eradication was reported in 10 trials involving 811 participants and varied from 0% to 100%. Meta-analysis of microbiological eradication as an outcome in these trials was not possible because of the difference in type of antibiotics used. For this reason, we analysed results separately for each study.</P>
<P>In the study by Bass (<LINK REF="STD-Bass-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Bass 1969</LINK>) there was microbiological eradication on day seven of treatment in the oxytetracycline (8/10) and erythromycin (9/10) treatment groups over the untreated group (RR 17; 95% CI 1.11 to 259.87 and RR 19; 95% CI 1.25 to 287.92, respectively) (Analysis 1.6.2 and Analysis 1.6.4). Microbiological eradication was not statistically significant in the chloramphenicol treatment group (7/10) compared with the untreated group (0/10); and microbiological eradication was not achieved in the ampicillin treatment group (0/10) compared with the untreated group (0/10). No statistically significant benefit was found with one antibiotic compared with another antibiotic, with regard to microbiological eradication in nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adcock-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Adcock 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Degn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Degn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strangert-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Strangert 1969</LINK>).</P>

<P>In a study by Halperin (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>) microbiological relapse (defined as a positive culture one week post-completion of therapy after a negative end-of-therapy culture) was reported in 1/72 (1.4%) with erythromycin estolate (seven days) compared to 0/83 (0%) with erythromycin estolate (14 days) (RR 3.45; 95% CI 0.14 to 83.44) (Analysis 1.7.5). In the study by Langley (<LINK REF="STD-Langley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2004</LINK>) no bacterial recurrence was demonstrated in the 51 patients in the azithromycin group or the 53 patients in the erythromycin group with one-week post-treatment cultures available.</P>

<P>Respiratory complications (defined as development of bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia or bronchitis complications) of whooping cough were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 1953</LINK>): 7/96 (7%) in the Aureomycin group compared to 5/98 (5%) in the chloramphenicol group. Otitis media as a complication of whooping cough was reported in the (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>) trial with 0/76 (0%) developing otitis media in the clarithromycin (seven days) group and 6/77 (8%) in the erythromycin estolate (14 days) group. There was no significant difference in complications in either trial.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>Side effects were reported in six trials involving 975 participants. Meta-analysis of side effects in these trials was not possible because of the difference in the types of antibiotics used. We therefore analysed results separately for each study. Fewer side effects were noted with azithromycin (three days) compared with erythromycin (14 days) (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.75) (Analysis 1.10.2) in <LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK>; and with clarithromycin (seven days) compared with erythromycin estolate (14 days) (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.97) (Analysis 1.10.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>). No significant difference in side effects of one antibiotic over another was found in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strangert-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Strangert 1969</LINK>). In the study by Langley (<LINK REF="STD-Langley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2004</LINK>) fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects were noted with azithromycin (five days) compared with erythromycin estolate (10 days) (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.62) (Analysis 1.11.2). In the study by Lebel (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>) 24/76 (32%) had gastrointestinal adverse effects with clarithromycin (seven days) and in 34/77 (44%) with erythromycin estolate (14 days) but this was not statistically different. Diarrhoea as a drug-related side effect was reported by Henry (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1981</LINK>): in 2/10 (20%) with erythromycin stearate (seven days) compared to 1/12 (10%) with co-trimoxazole (seven days) but this was not statistically different.</P>

In the study by Hoppe (<LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>) better compliance was achieved in those receiving erythromycin ethylsuccinate compared to those receiving erythromycin estolate (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.94) (Analysis 1.13.1). Compliance was better in those children who received azithromycin compared to those who received erythromycin estolate (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.45 to 1.85) (Analysis 1.14.1) (<LINK REF="STD-Langley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2004</LINK>). In the study by Lebel (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>) those receiving clarithromycin had better compliance than those receiving erythromycin estolate (MD 9.90; 95% CI 5.34 to 14.46) (Analysis 1.15.1).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Microbiological eradication</HEADING>
<P>Four trials involving 358 participants compared the efficacy of antibiotics in the microbiological eradication of <I>B. pertussis</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK>). Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant benefit of long-term antibiotic treatment (10 to 14 days with erythromycin estolate or unspecified salt of erythromycin) compared to short-term antibiotic treatment (azithromycin for three to five days, erythromycin estolate for seven days, or clarithromycin for seven days) in microbiological eradication of <I>B. pertussis</I> (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis by excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK> study, which to date has only been published as an abstract.

In the study by Halperin (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK>) microbiological relapse was reported in 1/72 (1.4%) of patients receiving erythromycin estolate for seven days compared to 0/83 (0%) in the group receiving erythromycin estolate for 14 days. However, there was no significant difference in microbiological relapse between seven days treatment with erythromycin estolate and 14 days treatment with the same antibiotic (RR 3.45; 95% CI 0.14 to 83.44) (Analysis 2.4.1).</P>

Frequency of whooping cough in the vaccinated contacts was reported by Grob (<LINK REF="STD-Grob-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1981</LINK>). No vaccinated child had whooping cough: in the erythromycin ethylsuccinate group (0/32) or in the placebo group (0/28) (RR not estimable).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-23 07:55:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only 13 studies met our inclusion criteria in our literature search between 1953 and 2011. Eleven of these addressing treatment included 1796 patients (1628 children and 168 adults) or household contacts; and two addressing contact prophylaxis of 401 household contacts with children culture-positive for <I>B. pertussis</I>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity of studies</HEADING>
<P>Included studies were too heterogeneous with regard to intervention and outcomes to allow pooling of results. In only three trials was meta-analysis possible, comparing short-term versus long-term antibiotic treatment of whooping cough (subgroup analysis).</P>
<P>The studies varied greatly in timing of <I>B. pertussis </I>cultures for participants (for example, catarrhal stage versus paroxysmal stage), types of antibiotic used, dose regimes and duration of treatment with antibiotics. In general, nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken at the beginning of the study and repeated after the completion of treatment. The end-of-treatment cultures varied according to the planned duration of therapy. For example, in the study by Strangert (<LINK REF="STD-Strangert-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Strangert 1969</LINK>) the duration of treatment in both treatment groups was six days while in a study by Lebel (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>) the duration of treatment was seven days with clarithromycin compared to 14 days with erythromycin estolate. Nasopharyngeal cultures were taken at seven days (for clarithromycin group) and at 14 days (for the erythromycin group) but not at seven and 14 days for both. Furthermore, cultures taken one or two weeks post-completion of therapy, that might indicate microbiological relapses, were missing in many studies.</P>
<P>Interestingly, many studies initially enrolled larger number of patients based on the clinical diagnosis of pertussis (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>) but subsequently only 30% to 40% were found to be <I>B. pertussis</I> culture-positive. This can be attributed to many factors:</P>
<P>(i) the organism can usually be recovered during the catarrhal stage but not two or three weeks after the onset of paroxysms (<LINK REF="REF-Krugman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krugman 1992</LINK>);<BR/>(ii) isolation of <I>B. pertussis</I> depends on correct collection of samples, careful transport and efficient processing of the samples obtained for culture; isolation is enhanced if the clinical microbiologist is experienced with the organism (<LINK REF="REF-Krugman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krugman 1992</LINK>);<BR/>(iii) although <I>B. pertussis</I> is the sole cause of epidemic pertussis, other organisms such as <I>B. parapertussis </I>and <I>Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica)</I> are occasional causes of pertussis (<LINK REF="REF-Long-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical diagnosis varied from one study to another. In the study by Adcock (<LINK REF="STD-Adcock-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Adcock 1972</LINK>) the clinical diagnosis of whooping cough was based on presence of typical 'whoop' and relative or absolute lymphocytosis; while in the study by Hoppe (<LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>) clinical pertussis meant non-specific cough at a time when pertussis was prevalent in the community, or early paroxysmal stage. Other studies provided no clear definition of clinical pertussis.</P>
<P>Types of antibiotics used in trials for treatment or contact prophylaxis were different. Antibiotic choice varied in every aspect: (i) type of antibiotic used, (ii) dose, (iii) salt preparation and (iv) duration of treatment (that is, from three to 14 days or more). It was difficult to find even two studies that used similar antibiotic regimens. These differences made it difficult to undertake quantitative meta-analysis for most aspects of the study and recommendations, therefore, were finally made on the basis of individual studies.</P>
<P>It is noticeable that there was only one study included in the treatment regimen that compared antibiotics with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bass-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Bass 1969</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK> reported that in Germany it would be considered unethical by most physicians to withhold appropriate antimicrobial treatment from a child with proven or strongly suspected pertussis. This view might also be applicable in many other parts of the world. However, from a purely scientific perspective the lack of such knowledge makes it hard to know the true effect of antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>The age of participants enrolled in the studies was not mentioned in most of the included studies, the one exception being the study by Bass (<LINK REF="STD-Bass-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Bass 1969</LINK>) where findings were stratified according to individual patient age. It is known that almost 90% of the reported deaths caused by whooping cough occur in non-immunised infants younger than one year of age (<LINK REF="REF-Hoppe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoppe 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further difficulties were encountered in the contact prophylaxis studies. The unit of randomisation in the two contact prophylactic studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grob-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1999</LINK>) was the household rather than individuals. All household members were allocated to the same treatment group (either antibiotic or placebo). <LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1999</LINK> reported that households were used as the unit of randomisation and in analysis because of concern that the risk of second cases of pertussis within a household were dependent not only on the index case but potentially on the other household contacts. <LINK REF="STD-Grob-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1981</LINK> reported that individual household member randomisation was not achievable and it was simpler to use the household as the unit of randomisation. Household randomisation is not equivalent to individual randomisation. Although it might be easier for the investigator to use the household as a unit for randomisation, such a method of randomisation made it difficult to know the 'real' effect of the antibiotic on individuals because all household members received either erythromycin or placebo. As a result of household randomisation it was not possible to determine the age of participants; assess the effectiveness of antibiotics in different age subgroups; or assess the effectiveness of antibiotics on immunised, partially immunised or non-immunised children.</P>
<P>The prophylaxis studies were only relevant to children older than six months of age. In the study by Halperin (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1999</LINK>) children younger than six months of age were excluded from the study and in the study by Grob (<LINK REF="STD-Grob-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1981</LINK>) there were no clear data about the inclusion of younger infants. Children below six months of age (who are incompletely immunised) have a higher rate of whooping cough and are at considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. A low incidence of culture-positive pertussis was found in the study by Halperin (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1999</LINK>) in both erythromycin and placebo groups, perhaps due to the high rate of immunisation and this led to the study being insufficiently powered to detect any significant difference.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, information on immunisation status was deficient in 6/10 (60%) of trials in the treatment of whooping cough and in 1/2 (50%) trials of contact prophylaxis. Immunisation status and type of immunisation (that is, passive or active) of individuals is valuable data because it may influence the apparent efficacy of antibiotics, particularly in contact prophylaxis. The proportion of individuals protected against clinical pertussis by full immunisation with the whole-cell vaccine is high but not as high as the proportion protected by natural disease (<LINK REF="REF-Krugman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krugman 1992</LINK>). Vaccine failure occurs in approximately 10% of individuals with some variation perhaps caused by the intensity of exposure to wild pertussis (<LINK REF="REF-Krugman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krugman 1992</LINK>). Comparative efficacy trials of acellular versus whole-cell vaccine for primary immunisation have been conducted in several countries. Products containing multiple pertussis components were superior to simple vaccines and compared favourably with whole-cell diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines. Reactogenicity of acellular DTP was significantly less (<LINK REF="REF-Long-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Immunity to whooping cough has been shown to wane five to 10 years after vaccination with whole-cell pertussis vaccines. Waning immunity following vaccination with acellular pertussis vaccines may also occur but data are currently limited (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>). This apparent loss of immunity has become particularly evident in recent years because of an increase in the incidence of reported cases of whooping cough in adolescents and young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Krugman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krugman 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a lack of uniformity in the monitoring of side effects and compliance of patients. The studies varied in types and clear definitions of the side effects, microbiological relapse and recurrence. Compliance was also poorly estimated in most of the studies. It was reported in only three studies and these varied in their measures of compliance. In the study by Hoppe (<LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>) compliance was measured by the detection of antimicrobial activity in the urine whereas in the studies by Lebel (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 2001</LINK>) and Halperin (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1999</LINK>) compliance was measured by the amount of the drug taken by patients.</P>
<P>A cost-benefit analysis was not part of this review but it is an important factor for healthcare services when considering choice of treatment. Unfortunately cost information was not provided in any of the included studies. In general, the cost of treatment with antibiotics varies from one country to another and many drugs are no longer patented. Calculation of the exact cost for each drug was not, therefore, undertaken in this review. In addition, modest benefits of antibiotics must be weighed up against the cost and inconvenience of therapy and the risk of side effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>This review identified 13 randomised controlled trials investigating antibiotics for treatment and contact prophylaxis of whooping cough. The methodological quality of these trials was variable. Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported adequate randomisation; in eight RCTs the method of allocation was unclear. Only in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Strangert-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Strangert 1969</LINK>) was the method of allocation concealment considered inadequate. Blinding was reported in seven of the 12 trials. Most trials compared one antibiotic with another antibiotic. The two prophylactic trials were placebo-controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Grob-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We carried out a subgroup analysis comparing short-term (three to seven days) with long-term (14 days) treatment with antibiotics. Other subgroup analyses, to determine potential causes of variability amongst treatment effects, were not possible because obtaining enough detailed data from studies of various subgroups was not possible. Important subgroups that should be addressed are adults versus children, early antibiotic treatment (that is, catarrhal stage) versus late antibiotic treatment (that is, paroxysmal or convalescent stage), antibiotics versus placebo and immunised versus non-immunised children. It is hoped that further data may become available to permit such analyses.</P>
<P>Although we performed sensitivity analysis by excluding one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK>), which to date has been published as an abstract only, this did not alter the conclusions significantly. Some of the planned analyses were constrained owing to heterogeneity of the included studies and the inability to perform a quantitative meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations of the systematic review</HEADING>
<P>All 11 of the included RCTs of treatment involved children only and no trials were found specifically in adults. The two prophylaxis trials, which were done in household contacts, did not report separate data for adults and, therefore, subgroup analysis for adults was not possible. There were some differences between the studies regarding definition of whooping cough, patient diagnosis, inclusion criteria, interventions (that is, various types of antibiotics, doses used, duration) and outcome measures (that is, clinical cure, clinical improvement, microbiological eradication); which did not allow quantitative meta-analysis for most of the outcome measures.</P>
<P>In addition, there was minimal information on immunisation status of participants, microbiological relapse, definition of clinical cure or improvement and timing of intervention (for example, catarrhal stage, paroxysmal stage). There was a lack of blinding in some studies (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Bass-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Bass 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Halperin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoppe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoppe 1992</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Recommendation for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review of RCTs examining the treatment of whooping cough has found that antibiotic treatment is effective in eliminating <I>B. pertussis</I> from the nasopharynx and thus rendering participants non-infectious, but does not alter the clinical course of the illness. Prophylaxis with antibiotic was significantly associated with side effects; it did not significantly improve clinical symptoms, prevent the development of culture-positive <I>B. pertussis</I>, nor paroxysmal cough for more than two weeks, in contacts older than six months of age.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Information from other sources</HEADING>
<P>Special precaution is needed when treating or providing prophylaxis for newborns because infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in neonates has been reported following the use of erythromycin. In one case, pyloric stenosis developed in a breast-fed infant whose mother took erythromycin (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Honein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stang-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stang 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although short-term treatment of azithromycin successfully eradicated <I>B. pertussis</I> from the nasopharynx (<LINK REF="STD-Bace-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bace 2002</LINK>), it may affect carriage of <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)</I> in the nasopharynx. Leach (<LINK REF="REF-Leach-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1997</LINK>) reported in a prospective study that community-based treatment with azithromycin may result in the appearance of azithromycin-resistant strains of <I>S. pneumoniae</I> in the nasopharynx. No data are available regarding the effect of clarithromycin on <I>S. pneumoniae</I> nasopharyngeal carriage.</P>
<P>The results of this review suggest that tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also effective antibiotics for the clearance of <I>B. pertussis</I> from the nasopharynx but these drugs have a number of serious side effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend the use of tetracycline in children less than eight years old (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1977</LINK>), based on the fact that administration of tetracycline during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of eight years) may cause permanent discolouration of the teeth (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1975</LINK>). Tetracycline may also result in photosensitivity and hepatotoxicity, and is contraindicated in pregnancy and breast-feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Smilack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smilack 1999</LINK>). The most serious side effect of chloramphenicol is aplastic anaemia; it increases the relative risk of this disorder 13-fold (<LINK REF="REF-Wallerstein-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallerstein 1969</LINK>). Grey baby syndrome is another potentially fatal adverse reaction to chloramphenicol, occurring mainly in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1960</LINK>). Dose-related association between the use of chloramphenicol and the development of acute lymphocytic and non-lymphocytic leukaemias has also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Shu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shu 1987</LINK>). With the availability of other effective antibiotics it seems unnecessary to use these antibiotics for treatment of whooping cough.</P>
<P>Roxithromycin is a very popular antibiotic in Australia and is frequently used as an alternative to erythromycin but this macrolide antibiotic has not been studied in whooping cough. In vitro studies show that roxithromycin is generally two- to four-fold less active than erythromycin against <I>B. pertussis</I> organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Kucers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kucers 1997</LINK>). However, there are no clinical studies of the efficacy of this antibiotic in the treatment or prophylaxis of whooping cough.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotics for treatment of pertussis</HEADING>
<P>The findings of this review suggest that administration of antibiotics for the treatment of whooping cough is effective in eliminating <I>B. pertussis </I>from patients with the disease to render them non-infectious but does not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. The effective regimens include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>three days of azithromycin (10 mg/kg as a single dose);</LI>
<LI>five days of azithromycin (10 mg/kg on the first day of treatment and 5 mg/kg once daily on the second day to fifth days of treatment);</LI>
<LI>seven days of clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily);</LI>
<LI>seven to 14 days of erythromycin (40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses);</LI>
<LI>14 days of erythromycin (60 mg/kg/day in three divided doses);</LI>
<LI>seven days of oxytetracycline (50 mg/kg/day in four divided doses); or</LI>
<LI>seven days of chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg/day in four divided doses).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The best regimens for microbiological clearance, with fewer side effects, are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>three days of azithromycin (10 mg/kg as a single dose);</LI>
<LI>five days of azithromycin (10 mg/kg on the first day of treatment and 5 mg/kg once daily on the second day to fifth days of treatment); or</LI>
<LI>seven days of clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Seven days of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (20 mg trimethoprim with 100 mg sulphamethoxazole per dose, twice daily, for children under six months of age; double this dose for older children) appears to be effective in eradicating <I>B. pertussis</I> from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who can not tolerate a macrolide. The use of oxytetracycline or chloramphenicol is not recommended in the treatment of whooping cough because of their potential side effects, especially in children, and because of the availability of other effective and safer antibiotics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotics for prophylaxis against whooping cough</HEADING>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts. Prophylaxis with antibiotics was significantly associated with side effects and did not significantly improve clinical symptoms, whoop, paroxysmal cough, number of cases who develop culture-positive <I>B. pertussis</I> or paroxysmal cough for more than two weeks in contacts older than six months of age. Due to the high risk of morbidity and mortality in infants less than six months of age who are incompletely immunised, contact prophylaxis is recommended for families who have an infant less than six months of age. The recommended antibiotics and dosages for contact prophylaxis are the same as those recommended in the treatment of whooping cough.</P>

<P>We would encourage authors of future trials to follow the revised CONSORT guidelines (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials), which have been adopted by several leading journals and can be found on the Internet (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>). CONSORT comprises a checklist and flow diagram to help improve the quality of reports of RCTs. It offers a standard way for researchers to report trials. The checklist includes descriptions of the randomisation procedure (allocation concealment), the mechanisms of blinding, number of people lost during the follow up, and some details about the analysis made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Specific</HEADING>
<P>Given the growing importance of pertussis in infants and adolescents, there seems to be an urgent need for larger RCTs for treatment of and prophylaxis against whooping cough. Future trials should incorporate simple and clear indices for clinical outcomes (such as clinical cure, duration of symptoms, severity and improvement), microbiological eradication, microbiological relapse, side effects, compliance and attack rate (in prophylaxis trials). Further therapeutic studies of appropriate size are needed based on age, immunological status, duration of disease and cost/benefit ratios from both patients and contacts. Special emphasis on the effectiveness of antibiotics, compared to placebo, for treatment of or prophylaxis against whooping cough in vaccinated and unvaccinated participants is needed. Short-duration trials with newer macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin and perhaps roxithromycin are desirable.</P>

<P>Comment: In the section &#8220;Antibiotics for prophylaxis against whooping cough&#8221; it states:</P>
<P>"In the study by Halperin 1999 the number of cases that became culture positive for B. pertussis after prophylaxis was slightly less in the erythromycin group 3/142 (2.1%) compared to placebo 8/158 (5.1%) group but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.42; 95%CI 0.11 to 1.54) (Analysis 3.8.1). Culture positivity or development of two weeks of paroxysmal cough after prophylaxis occurred in 6/124 (4.8%) contacts in the erythromycin estolate group and 8/132 (6.1%) contacts in the placebo group. There was no significant benefit of erythromycin estolate over placebo in contacts (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.24) (Analysis 3.9.1) (Halperin 1999)." (Altunaiji et al, 2011, p.11)</P>
<P>The original paper by Halperin et al (<A HREF="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/104/4/e42.abstract">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/104/4/e42.abstract</A> ) randomised families by household to receive erythromycin (n=73 households) or placebo (n=79 households). They reported that 4 households in the erythromycin group and 15 households in the placebo group had a member who developed a positive culture for pertussis. They then analysed these results by household, by protocol rather than intent to treat. They reported a significant difference between the groups (p=0.026). (They also reported no differences between groups when analysed by self-reported symptoms, arguably reflecting the low sensitivity of symptoms for differentiating pertussis from other respiratory infections.)</P>
<P>Calculating the relative risk of a secondary case of pertussis within an erythromycin compared to placebo household by ITT gives: 4/73 (5.5%) divided by 15/79 (18.9%) = RR 0.3 (95%CI 0.1, 0.8); NNT=8. Thus, in contrast to what is cited in the quote above, the primary analysis by Halperin et al does show a statistically significant effect of treatment.</P>
<P>The data cited in the quote above was actually carried out as a post-hoc analysis (contained in table four of Halperin et al). This analysis only included those individuals who did not report symptoms at the start of treatment. As well as being an unplanned secondary analysis, it does not take into account the clustered nature of the data.</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review has already been used in the formulation of guidelines in the UK (<A HREF="http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1287142671506">www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1287142671506</A> ). In this case, the guideline does recommend chemoprophylaxis for a selected population of household contacts.</P>
<P>However I would request that the Review team revisit the original Halperin et al paper, and consider reporting the primary outcome analysis rather than the post-hoc analysis when the Cochrane Review is next updated. At the present time there is a risk that those using the Review to inform guidelines may take the reported findings at face value, may not take the time to read the original trial report, and may not realise that there is evidence to support antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary cases of whooping cough.</P>
