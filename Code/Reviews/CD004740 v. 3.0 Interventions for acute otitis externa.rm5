<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 11:40:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Acute otitis externa causes inflammation of the ear canal. It is a common clinical problem encountered in general practice. This review assesses the various forms of medication used to treat the condition. Nineteen randomised controlled trials were included (3382 participants). Most were of low quality. The findings of the review may not be wholly relevant to primary care as most of the trials were conducted in a hospital setting and over half involved ear cleaning as part of the treatment (this is generally not available in primary care). However, the review does demonstrate that topical treatments alone are effective at treating acute otitis externa. There was little to choose between them in terms of effectiveness. However, when treatment needs to be extended beyond one week acetic acid drops appear to be less effective than antibiotic/steroid drops. In addition, symptoms persist for two days longer in those treated with acetic acid. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of steroid-only drops. Patients treated with antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-10 11:37:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low.</P>
<P>Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial).</P>
<P>In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively).</P>
<P>One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate.</P>
<P>No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning.</P>
<P>Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-10 11:39:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:</P>
<P>Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid.</P>
<P>The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed.</P>
<P>Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.</P>
<P>Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 13:43:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Otitis externa is a broad term used to describe an inflammatory condition affecting the ear canal, with or without infection. The inflammation is usually generalised throughout the ear canal and can affect the outer ear. It can be subdivided into acute (less than six weeks), recurrent acute and chronic (more than three months). Acute otitis externa is the most common form occurring in everyday practice (<LINK REF="REF-Boustred-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boustred 1999</LINK>), and will form the focus of this review. There are a number of popular synonyms such as 'hot weather ear', 'tropical ear' and 'swimmer's ear'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Acute otitis externa typically presents with discomfort within the ear canal which is worsened if the outer ear is touched or pulled gently. The affected ear can feel blocked or full. Discharge from the ear canal can occur. If the ear canal becomes very swollen the patient may also complain of hearing loss.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Frequency</HEADING>
<P>Each year otitis externa is reported to affect four out of 1000 Americans (<LINK REF="REF-Guthrie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthrie 1999</LINK>), and has a 12-month prevalence in the UK of just over 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Rowlands-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowlands 2001</LINK>). In the Netherlands the incidence is 12 to 14 per 1000 population per year (<LINK REF="REF-Rooijackers_x002d_Lemmens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooijackers-Lemmens 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is an increase in episodes observed at the end of summer. However, it is not clear whether this is due to warmer ambient temperature, increased humidity, increased exposure to water or patients delaying consultation because they were on holiday (<LINK REF="REF-Rowlands-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowlands 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Demographics</HEADING>
<P>Acute otitis externa is seen in all age groups. The peak incidence in one study was in children aged seven to 12 years (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 2002</LINK>). It affects males and females equally and is five times more common in regular swimmers compared to non-swimmers (<LINK REF="REF-Hoadley-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoadley 1975</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Impact on quality of life</HEADING>
<P>In one study, otitis externa was found to be disabling enough to cause 36% (35/98) of patients to interrupt their daily activities for a median duration of four days, with 21% (21/98) requiring bed rest for a median period of three days (<LINK REF="REF-van-Asperen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Asperen 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Predisposing factors</HEADING>
<P>Acute otitis externa occurs following a disturbance in the normal protective acidic milieu within the ear canal, secondary to a complex interaction of environmental and host factors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Environmental factors</HEADING>
<P>Environmental factors comprise the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Moisture - macerates the skin of the canal, elevates ear canal pH and removes the protective layer of cerumen (e.g. swimming, perspiration, high humidity).</LI>
<LI>Trauma - leads to a breech in the integrity of the ear canal skin (e.g. cotton buds, fingernails, hearing aids, ear plugs, paper clips, match sticks, mechanical removal of cerumen).</LI>
<LI>High environmental temperatures.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Host factors</HEADING>
<P>Host factors are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Anatomical &#8211; wax and debris accumulate and lead to moisture retention (e.g. a narrow ear canal, hairy ear canal).</LI>
<LI>Cerumen - absence or overproduction of cerumen (leads to loss of the protective layer and moisture retention respectively).</LI>
<LI>Chronic dermatological disease (e.g. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis).</LI>
<LI>Immunocompromise (e.g. chemotherapy, HIV, AIDS).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications</HEADING>
<P>Regional dissemination of infection can lead to myringitis, auricular cellulitis, perichondritis, facial cellulitis and systemic toxicity. It may progress to chronic otitis externa and can lead to ear canal stenosis. Necrotising otitis externa is a life-threatening extension of otitis externa into the temporal bone resulting in osteomyelitis. It is caused almost exclusively by <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and occurs most often in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus and in the immunocompromised.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Most cases of acute otitis externa are treated in primary care by general practitioners or family practice physicians. In the UK only 3% of patients with otitis externa treated in primary care are referred to secondary care (<LINK REF="REF-Rowlands-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowlands 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mainstays of treatment in primary care are the use of a topical antimicrobial (antiseptics or antibiotics, with or without steroids) and avoidance of precipitating factors. Management of pain is also required. Refractory cases of uncomplicated acute otitis externa referred to secondary care usually fall into two categories. Firstly, those with very swollen ear canals through which treatment cannot be administered. Insertion of a medicated wick will address this problem. Secondly, patients with copious amounts of debris and discharge within the canal. This responds well to ear cleaning (dry-mopping or suction) followed by a further course of topical therapy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Topical antibiotics are generally recommended as the first-line treatment of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Hannley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannley 2000</LINK>). However, recent reviews have shown that up to 40% of patients are prescribed systemic medication in addition to topical therapy, many of which are not active against <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> or <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (the most common bacterial pathogens in otitis externa) (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowlands-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowlands 2001</LINK>). Only part of that use will be explained by a concomitant diagnosis of otitis media or evidence of regional spread of otitis externa. The significant use of oral antibiotics, in addition to topical therapy, has implications in terms of cost, risk of side effects and increased likelihood of non-compliance. The emergence of bacterial resistance through over-zealous use of oral antibiotics is another major concern.</P>
<P>Topical antibiotics commonly contain an aminoglycoside (neomycin, gentamicin) or a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin). Topical aminoglycosides are potentially ototoxic when used in the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, whereas topical fluoroquinolones are not. If the tympanic membrane is known to be intact and the middle ear and mastoid are closed, the use of a potentially ototoxic preparation presents no risk of ototoxic injury (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 2004b</LINK>). Consequently, most cases of acute otitis externa can be treated with either a topical aminoglycoside or a topical fluoroquinolone. The difficulty arises when the integrity of the tympanic membrane is not known (e.g. if the tympanic membrane is obscured by debris, discharge or swelling). If a tympanic membrane perforation was present but not visible, the use of an aminoglycoside drop would inadvertently put the patient at risk of developing ototoxicity. To date no specific guidance has been issued on this matter. However, cognizance of guidelines issued for treating middle ear disease would support the use of a topical antibiotic preparation free of potential ototoxicity when the integrity of the tympanic membrane was unknown. In the UK, non-ototoxic quinolone drops are not licensed for use in the ear. Individual doctors have the option of either using these drops 'off license' or a short course of aminoglycoside drops. Both practices have been deemed acceptable by ENT-UK (the national representative body for Ear, Nose and Throat surgeons in the UK) (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neomycin is associated with a 15% incidence of contact dermatitis; the development of such contact sensitivity should be considered a possibility when patients with acute otitis externa fail to completely resolve with treatments containing it.</P>
<P>In recent years the possibility of significant bacterial resistance emerging following the use of topical ear medication has been raised. It was previously thought that a lack of significant systemic absorption and the ability of topical antibiotics to achieve very high concentrations in the middle ear would make this scenario very unlikely. However, evidence from the ophthalmology literature showing increasing bacterial resistance to topical fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol drops used to treat corneal ulcers has raised concern (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2007</LINK>). A recent evidence-based review concluded, on the basis of the grade B evidence available, that no significant topical antibiotic resistance develops from the use of ototopical antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2004</LINK>). The question of whether ototopical medication can produce systemic resistance and, potentially, failure of systemic antibacterial therapy remains unanswered. In the future, it may be the case that antiseptics, used commonly in the past, could see a resurgence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Microbiology</HEADING>
<P>The microbiology of otitis externa varies according to geographical location. In general, the most common organisms reported in acute otitis externa are <I>Pseudomonas</I> and <I>Staphylococcus</I> species. Fungi are a less common cause (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 2002</LINK>). Cases of acute otitis externa can usually be treated empirically without the need for prior microbiological culture. Ear swabs tend to be reserved for refractory cases. MRSA (methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>) otitis externa is an emerging concern. Thus far it has been treated successfully with ear cleaning and topical treatment, although there remains an underlying concern that this may not be sufficient in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Walshe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walshe 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevention</HEADING>
<P>Prevention involves avoidance of predisposing factors and the treatment of any underlying dermatological condition. Any self-inflicted trauma to the ear canal should be eliminated. Frequent washing of the ears with soap should be avoided as the alkaline residue neutralises the acidic pH the ear canal. With regard to water, two options are available: the first is to observe strict water precautions (preventing water entering the ear canal) whilst bathing or swimming through the use of ear plugs (kept clean to prevent re-infection), a bathing cap, or application of cotton-balls smeared with petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to cover the ear canal entrances. The second option is ensure the ear canals are emptied of water after bathing or swimming, either by tilting the head and pulling on the ear to help empty it, or using a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting to dry the ears. It has been suggested that the instillation of acidifying drops after swimming or bathing will also help.<BR/>

Where outcomes were not reported, we contacted the author of the paper for this information as the data may have been collected but not reported. We excluded studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review and stated the reason in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>VK and TM assessed the methodological quality of all the trials identified as eligible for inclusion. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for further clarification.</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of trials in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and inclusion of randomised participants. We classified generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment and the inclusion of randomised participants as adequate, inadequate and unclear as outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>. Blinding was classified as double-blind or single-blind.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>VK extracted data on study characteristics, including methods, participants, interventions and outcomes, and recorded these on standard forms. In studies where data were insufficient or missing, we contacted the authors of the original studies. This was mainly done through electronic mail. If there was no reply on the first occasion, we made a second attempt.</P>
<P>Where possible we extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis (i.e. the analysis should include all the participants in the groups to which they were originally assigned). If the number randomised and the numbers analysed were inconsistent, we calculated a percent loss to follow up and reported this information in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. For binary outcomes, we recorded the total number of participants and number with the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, for each group, we extracted the number of participants, and the arithmetic means and standard deviations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>VK entered data into Review Manager 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooling of data from individual studies was considered valid only if the drug categories being compared were the same and the time points at which data were collected were similar.</P>
<P>For binary data, we combined trials using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We combined trials with continuous data using weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval. Where data were reported using medians and ranges, or there was evidence of skewed data, we reported medians and ranges where possible (dividing the mean by the standard deviation (SD); results of &lt; 1.64 indicate a positive skew). If continuous data were reported using geometric means, we combined the findings on a log scale and reported on the original scale.</P>
<P>If a multiple-intervention trial had more than one intervention group in common in relation to a specific meta-analysis, these control groups were combined and compared to the experimental intervention group, thus creating a single pair-wise comparison. This avoids 'double-counting' participants in the 'shared' intervention group(s) which would create a unit of analysis error due to the unaddressed correlation between the estimated intervention effects from multiple comparisons.</P>
<P>Trialists would usually measure their outcome measures on more than one occasion. In general, these assessment visits fell into the following categories: early (e.g. half-way through treatment), end-of-therapy (a day or so after the cessation of treatment), test-of-cure (around a week after treatment), or test-of-recurrence (a few weeks after treatment had finished). Trialists varied in the number and timing of visits they chose. In order to make a fair comparison between trials it is important to compare outcome measures taken at similar times. It was therefore decided a priori that pooling of data from different studies (meta-analysis) would only be performed on outcome measures taken at similar times.</P>
<P>The primary analysis is of all eligible studies. If a sufficient number of trials is available for future updates (not available for each comparison in this version of the review), we will explore whether heterogeneity can be explained using subgroup analyses or meta-regression for the following factors: age (under 16, and adults 16 years or older), ear cleaning (dividing studies into those with some form of ear cleaning, and those without), co-interventions (dividing studies into those with treatment comparison alone, and those with treatment comparison in combination with other co-interventions), and methodological quality (initially excluding studies of poorest quality). Sensitivity analyses will also be used to explore methodological quality (notably adequate concealment) and trial design (e.g. cluster randomisation). We will display the results for each sensitivity analysis according to the subgroups within each methods category.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis will include the following, as outlined in the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Group 'Guidelines for Reviewers' (Cochrane ENT Guideline updated November 2000).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Repeat the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if any).</LI>
<LI>Repeat the analysis excluding studies of the lowest quality (already done if there is heterogeneity).</LI>
<LI>If there are one or more very large studies, we will repeat the analysis excluding these, to investigate how much they dominate the results.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For this version of the review, we visually examined forest plots, in conjunction with the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, using a 5% level of statistical significance, and used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic describes the percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). A value greater than 30% is usually considered important (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2004</LINK>). There were insufficient trials to investigate publication bias using funnel plots; this may be done in further updates of the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnostic criteria for included participants</HEADING>
<P>Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> provides eligibility criteria and more detailed acute otitis externa diagnostic criteria.</P>
<P>The definitions of acute otitis externa used by trialists were not explicit, varied between studies and in some cases were not stated.</P>
<P>Trials specifically evaluating acute otitis externa were included in this review: <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Masood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Olivera 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadsten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wadsten 1985</LINK>.</P>
<P>Trials referring to "otitis externa" were included if there was strong evidence to suggest they were studying acute otitis externa (<LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emgard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emgard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsikoudas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsikoudas 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials involving cases of recurrent acute otitis externa were permitted.</P>
<P>Trials involving chronic otitis externa, eczematous otitis externa or fungal otitis externa were excluded.</P>
<P>The maximum duration of signs and symptoms was only mentioned in five studies and ranged from two to four weeks.</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria were typically brief.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria varied from none to exhaustive.</P>
<P>Studies investigating otorrhoea, mastoid cavity infections, chronic suppurative otitis media, or postoperative infections as well as acute otitis externa were permitted only if the data for the acute otitis externa group were extractable.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> provides details of the treatment regimens used in the trials.</P>
<P>There were two multiple-intervention studies:<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK> (three interventions) and <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> (three interventions).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ear cleaning</HEADING>
<P>The definition and use of ear cleaning varied between studies. Ear cleaning was explicitly mentioned in 11 trials. Eight studies did not mention it. Of those utilising ear cleaning, nine performed it only on entry. The remaining two also utilised ear cleaning at subsequent visits. Studies that used ear cleaning rarely stated how this was performed. Some studies were more specific and mentioned the use manual toileting or suction. Two studies were conducted in primary care; one study performed ear cleaning at the initial visit (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>) and the other did not mention whether it was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Medicated wicks</HEADING>
<P>The use of medicated wicks was variable. A number of studies permitted the use of medicated wicks at the start of the study if the ear canal was swollen. Patients were usually instructed to remove these themselves after a specific period of time and then administer the topical medication directly to the affected ear. Most wicks were used for 24 to 48 hours. All of the studies medicated their wicks with the appropriate trial intervention drug. Where wicks were used on an ad hoc basis, studies did not report their individual outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topical treatments</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table indicates which review outcomes were covered by each trial. Additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> describes the definitions used by the trials for each review outcome, and how and when outcomes were measured and reported.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical response</HEADING>
<P>Trialists often used a combination of clinical outcome measures when reporting results:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Cure rate - 12 trials</HEADING>
<P>Over half of trials reported resolution of acute otitis externa as their primary outcome measure. Reporting results this way leads to binary outcomes which can be used in meta-analysis. The definition of complete resolution or cure varied between trials, some trials requiring the complete absence of symptoms and signs, whereas others permitted minor symptoms and signs to be present. The symptoms and signs evaluated by trialists were similar and included pain, itchiness, redness, swelling and discharge.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Clinical response - one trial</HEADING>
<P>Where trials reported separate categories for completely successful, partially successful and unsuccessful, we have classed partially successful/satisfactory as failure along with any other cases of failure reported. Where trials did not report a completely cured category and just referred to responses as improvement versus no improvement, improvement has been classed as success.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Severity score - nine trials</HEADING>
<P>Severity scoring systems varied from simple to more elaborate systems. Studies that used this method of outcome assessment handled the data in different ways. Some studies simply reported the mean change in severity scores for between groups, while others stipulated a priori that a certain reduction in symptom score would constitute a clinical improvement. The data from the latter group of studies is readily convertible into binary outcomes that can be used in meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Time to recovery - two trials</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK> reported time to complete disappearance of inflammation as determined by daily clinical examination. <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> assessed time to recovery of symptoms according to daily patient diary entries.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> assessed recurrence rate by telephone call at day 42.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">7. Analgesic use - three trials</HEADING>
<P>Analgesic consumption was documented by patients in their diaries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Microbiological response</HEADING>
<P>Only five trials evaluated a microbiological response to treatment, two utilising more than one method:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Microbial cure - two trials</HEADING>
<P>In these trials microbiological swabs were taken at entry and at the end of treatment from each participant. Patients that had a positive culture at entry that subsequently became culture negative after treatment were classified as a microbial cure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Eradication of pathogens - two trials</HEADING>
<P>Microbiological swabs were taken on entry for each group as a whole and the number and frequency of each pathogen documented (note: an ear with acute otitis externa may grow more than one pathogenic species). The process was repeated at the end of treatment. The reduction in the number of pathogenetic organisms for each group can therefore be calculated. This measure does not relate to individual patient outcomes and the authors of this review agreed a priori that these data would not be analysed as part of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Clinical-microbiological response - three trials</HEADING>
<P>These trials evaluated the microbiological evaluable population (i.e. those who had a positive culture at entry to the study). The number of participants that became culture negative after treatment was then determined. Those who were culture negative after treatment and were clinically cured after treatment constituted a clinical-microbiological success.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were observed in nine trials. None were observed in five trials. Adverse events were not mentioned in five trials. Results of adverse events collected are reported in additional <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> (Safety).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Timing of outcome assessments</HEADING>
<P>This varied between trials. All had baseline assessments on entry (day 1). Most conducted an assessment at an early stage (day three to five), one immediately at the end of treatment period (sometimes referred to as the end-of-treatment "EOT" visit) (day 7 to 10), and further assessments were usually conducted several days after treatment had finished (sometimes referred to as the test-of-cure "TOC" visit (day 14 to 21). Test-of-recurrence assessments were carried out from day 21 onwards.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis and handling of bilateral disease</HEADING>
<P>Trials presented results either by participant or by ear. The handling of bilateral disease across trials was inconsistent. It is known that left and right ears are not independent. Consequently, trials involving patients with bilateral disease that reported results only at ear level were excluded to avoid any effect on interaural correlation on the analysis of the results. However, trials with bilateral disease were permitted if one of the ears was selected for study (trialists would consequently report results at participant level). Only a few trialists were explicit in their handling of bilateral disease (e.g. one ear was chosen through random selection and analysed; or the ear with the highest overall clinical score was designated the target ear and treated, the right ear being designated the target ear in the case of identical scores).</P>

The 10% cure rate in the control group is not readily explainable, although it seems most likely to be attributable to the drug vehicle. Other factors such as the process of ear cleaning or the underlying pathological inflammatory process burning itself out may have also contributed.</P>

<P>The steroid components were as follows: hydrocortisone (<LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK>) and dexamethasone (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>The figure shows the results at seven to nine days, 14 days and 21 days.</P>
<P>The pooled result for all three trials at seven to nine days indicated a non-significant difference between the two interventions. However, there appears to be moderate heterogeneity observed in the results (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 46%). Of these three pooled studies both <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK> had a lower methodological quality score (B) compared with <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> (A). Given the low number of studies involved in the meta-analysis and the fact that there are no outlying studies in terms of methodological quality it is unlikely that quality is the cause of the observed heterogeneity. Further inspection of the individual studies reveals a difference in the steroid components between the trials. <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> used dexamethasone. The other trials used hydrocortisone. The glucocorticoid potency of hydrocortisone is low, whereas dexamethasone is high. In light of this it was decided to combine only studies using the same steroid group and reassess homogeneity. Pooling <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK> reduces I<SUP>2 </SUP>to 0%.

The individual result for <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> at seven days also indicates no significant difference between the two groups: OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.14).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 13:25:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>For uncomplicated acute otitis externa the use of a topical antimicrobial (antibiotic or antiseptic), with or without steroid, is highly effective. Trials report a 55% to 100% cure rate. In comparison, instillation of drug vehicle (placebo drops) accompanied by ear cleaning only achieves a cure rate of 10%.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cleaning of the ear canal</HEADING>
<P>No trial specifically endeavoured to evaluate the efficacy of cleaning of the ear canal. It is performed at entry to most trials in order to secure the diagnosis of acute otitis externa and permit evaluation of the response to treatment. Ear cleaning is performed frequently in secondary care to help treat refractory cases of acute otitis externa associated with very swollen ear canals or copious amounts of debris and discharge. In contrast, it is rarely performed in primary care where the vast majority of cases of acute otitis externa are successfully treated. It would be useful to be able to quantify the effect of this intervention through a future trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quinolone versus non-quinolone</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial of moderate quality (<LINK REF="STD-Sabater-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sabater 1996</LINK>). Similar clinical outcomes were found in the quinolone and non-quinolone groups. The outcomes observed in trials comparing quinolone/steroid against non-quinolone/steroid were also equivalent (<LINK REF="STD-Roland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wadsten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wadsten 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Roland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2004</LINK> did show a significant difference in favour of quinolone/steroid at day 18 (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.03 to 3.88). However, the lower limit of this confidence interval approaches 1.0 suggesting that negligible differences cannot be excluded. With regard to microbial cures in this trial, a significant difference in favour of quinolone/steroid was demonstrated at day 18: OR 2.94 (95% CI 1.33 to 6.50); this statistically significant result is also questionable as there was a significant difference in the distribution of gram positive and gram negative strains between treatment groups at baseline (P = 0.041). <LINK REF="STD-Roland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2007</LINK> reported that their quinolone/high-potency steroid group had significantly more relief of severe and significant pain over time (P = 0.0013 and P = 0.0456) and less inflammation (P = 0.0043) and oedema (P = 0.0148) compared to the non-quinolone/low-potency steroid group. It is likely that the observed difference in anti-inflammatory effects and pain relief are attributable to the difference in steroid potency between the two groups rather than the difference in antibiotic class. They did not report binary outcomes and so it is not possible to determine the magnitude or precision of their observed effect. The fact that no differences were found in analgesic use between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) suggests that their statistically significant results may not be clinically meaningful.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic/steroid versus antiseptic</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is available from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>). No difference was found between antibiotic/steroid and antiseptic in terms of clinical efficacy, with one exception: acetic acid drops did not perform well against non-quinolone antibiotic/high-potency steroid drops at two time points (they were comparable at seven days, but not at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62), OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58)) (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>). Recurrence at three to six weeks was also in favour of antibiotic/steroid: OR 3.12 (95% CI 1.37 to 7.09). In addition, the antibiotic/steroid group was significantly quicker to heal: 6.0 days (95% CI 5.1 to 6.9) versus 8.0 days (95% CI 7.0 to 9.0). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK> found that the antiseptic group healed more quickly: mean difference (MD) -1.80 days (95% CI -2.69 to -0.91). It is not possible to determine whether these conflicting findings are a result of differences in antiseptic potency, differences in steroid potency or a combination of the two.</P>
<P>It is interesting to evaluate the performance of the acetic acid alone group (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>). The cure rate at one, two and three weeks was 19/65 (29.2%), 37/65 (56.9%) and 40/65 (61.5%) respectively. Treatment for acute otitis externa is generally prescribed for seven to 10 days. Based on the results this study the seven to 10-day cure rate for acetic acid is likely to be at the lower end of the 29% to 56% range. Also noteworthy is that between two and three weeks only three additional participants were cured. Recurrence at three to six weeks is unlikely to be a strong indicator of a treatment's long-term benefit as it may be influenced by a number of other factors, such as the patient resuming swimming activities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic/steroid versus antiseptic/steroid</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one high quality trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>). No significant differences were noted between the two interventions. The antiseptic/steroid was acetic acid with triamcinolone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic/steroid versus antibiotic</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from three trials is available (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2006</LINK>). Clinical and clinical-microbiological outcomes were similar in both groups. Findings of <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2006</LINK> at days seven to nine, and <LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2008</LINK> at days 14 to 19 were significant, but confidence interval limits approach 1.0 suggesting that negligible differences cannot be excluded. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2008</LINK> was an ideal way of testing the effect of adding a steroid to an antibiotic as the antibiotic was the same in each group (unlike <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2006</LINK>). Polymyxin B/neomycin was compared with dexamethasone/polymyxin B/neomycin. Primary outcome measures were reported in non-binary form. Reduced swelling was noted in the antibiotic/steroid group between day one and four (P = 0.03). Patient global assessment of efficacy at the final visit suggested patients significantly favoured the antibiotic/steroid over the antibiotic alone, although this is a subjective measure and warrants cautious interpretation. Overall it appears that adding a high-potency steroid to an non-quinolone antibiotic drop does not affect cure rate, but may reduce swelling, although it is not possible to determine the magnitude or precision of the results as only P values were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antiseptic/steroid versus antiseptic</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>). Adding triamcinolone (medium-potency) steroid to acetic acid drops significantly improved cure rate at three weeks: OR 4.82 (95% CI 1.90 to 12.25). Although the results at one and two weeks and the recurrence rate at three to six weeks were statistically significant the limits of these confidence intervals approach 1.0 suggesting that negligible differences cannot be excluded (OR 2.19 (95% CI 1.05 to 4.57); 2.32 (95% CI 1.08 to 4.97); 0.44 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.01) respectively). From the authors' experience, treatment for acute otitis externa is usually given for seven to 10 days and in some cases for up to two weeks; at these time points the outcomes for both groups were not assuredly different and thus the findings at three weeks are unlikely to be clinically significant. Time to healing was similar for both groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic/steroid versus steroid alone</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tsikoudas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsikoudas 2002</LINK>). The clinical outcomes were similar in both groups (patient assessment P = 0.3 and observer assessment P = 0.164). P values were used and so it is not possible to determine the magnitude or precision of the effect. The trial was also of low quality. One must therefore interpret the result with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral antihistamine + steroid drop versus steroid drop alone</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial of moderate quality (<LINK REF="STD-Emgard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emgard 1999</LINK>). Clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. This supports the findings by <LINK REF="STD-Tsikoudas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsikoudas 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that using steroid drops alone is effective in treating acute otitis externa. Whilst most clinicians would be happy to prescribe them for cases of eczematous otitis externa, there is reluctance to use them in cases of acute otitis externa exhibiting mucopurulent discharge. In addition there is concern that the sole use of a steroid may render patients susceptible to developing secondary fungal otitis externa. The relevant studies in this review did not report any such problem. However, a personal communication with the author of one trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hilmi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilmi 2001</LINK>), which was subsequently abandoned because of this very problem, would suggest that there may be a degree of publication bias. Further investigation is warranted into the efficacy of steroid only drops with a well-designed trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic/steroid versus antibiotic (ointment on wicks followed by ointment application only)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2007</LINK>). The trial design was an ideal way of testing the effect of adding a low-potency steroid (hydrocortisone) to an antibiotic as the antibiotic was the same in each arm. Clinical outcomes were similar. However, subgroup analysis revealed resolution of "severe" redness (P = 0.045) and secretion (P = 0.024), from entry to day nine to 11 in favour of the antibiotic/steroid group. In addition significantly less paracetamol was consumed in the antibiotic/steroid group (P = 0.0455), although pain score reductions across groups were comparable. P values were reported and so it is not possible to determine the magnitude or precision of these secondary endpoints.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antifungal/antibiotic/steroid versus antiseptic/astringent (on medicated wicks)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Masood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Masood 2008</LINK>). This trial specifically set out to evaluate pain relief provided by two commonly used methods in the early treatment of severe acute otitis externa. Sign scores were comparable at 48 hours. Pain scores were significantly less in the antiseptic/astringent group (P &lt; 0.001). As P values were used it is not possible to determine the magnitude or precision of the result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral antibiotic + antibiotic/steroid drop versus antibiotic/steroid drop</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Roland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2008</LINK>). Similar outcomes were found in both groups suggesting that oral antibiotics are not required in the treatment of simple acute otitis externa. The high cure rates observed in the topical-only trials in this review further supports this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antiseptic/antibiotic/steroid versus antiseptic (sprays)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence is limited to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2006</LINK>). The sprays were continued until cure. Acetic acid spray is clinically less effective compared to acetic acid/non-quinolone/high-potency steroid spray: OR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.79) and 0.10 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.41) at two and four weeks. Furthermore, no additional patients in the acetic acid spray group were cured between the second and fourth week assessment points (12/32 (37.5%) and 12/32 (37.5%) at two and four weeks respectively). Acetic acid is a weak acid and this may be a reason for its lack of performance in spray and droplet form (see 'Antibiotic/steroid versus antiseptic' and 'Antiseptic/steroid versus antiseptic' comparisons above). However, since boric acid (also a weak acid) (<LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK>) performs equally well in comparison to interventions such as antibiotic/steroid drops or antibiotic/steroid/antifungal drops there is likely to be some other explanation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time to recovery</HEADING>
<P>Two trials investigated time to recovery (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> defined this as duration of symptoms according to daily patient diary entries. <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK> assessed patients daily and defined the time to recovery as the time required for signs of inflammation to resolve. <LINK REF="STD-Neher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Neher 2004</LINK> applied the medication to wicks which were subsequently inserted into the ear canal and changed on a daily basis in clinic; as this is method is unlikely to be reproducible in everyday clinical practice we decided to concentrate on the results of <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>In the study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> patient diaries showed that the median duration to recovery of symptoms when using antibiotic/steroid drops was 6.0 days (95% confidence interval of 5.1 to 6.9 days). Investigator assessment performed at day seven showed a cure rate of only 42% (31/73). The cure rate rose to 82% (60/73) at the second visit at day 14. It increased by just 4% (3/73) during continued treatment from day 14 until day 21. Although the overall cure rate for the group improved as treatment continued it is apparent that no substantial benefit was gained when treatment was continued beyond 14 days.</P>
<P>In clinical practice a seven to 10-day course of topical medication is usually prescribed. Patients with more severe infections may require 10 to 14 days of treatment. It is commonly recommended that drops be given for three days beyond the cessation of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Sander-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 2001</LINK>). This advice attempts to treat residual inflammation within the ear canal (resolution of clinical signs lags behind that of symptoms). It is unclear whether this practice confers any benefit.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> illustrates the fact that a standard seven to 10-day course of topical medication will overtreat some patients and undertreat others. In reality it is likely that patients whose symptoms subside during the standard treatment period discontinue their therapy, and those with symptoms persisting beyond the prescribed period self-medicate for a while, until they are cured or deem it necessary to see a doctor because they are not. Therefore from a practical standpoint, it may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct the patient to use them for at least a week. If they still have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after) for a maximum of a further seven days. It would seem reasonable to say that patients with symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Only three studies were of high quality. Eleven trials were double-blind and eight were single-blind. Only 11 studies performed adequate allocation concealment. It has been shown that trials which are not double-blind yield larger estimate of effects, with odds ratios being exaggerated by 17%. Similarly, trials in which concealment is either unclear or inadequate will exaggerate the estimate of effect by 30% and 41% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Shulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulz 1995</LINK>). Consequently, our pooled results will have an inherent tendency to overestimate efficacy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Setting</HEADING>
<P>All but two of the trials included in this review were conducted in specialist clinics. This does not reflect the pattern of care provision observed in clinical practice; in many countries cases of acute otitis externa are seen and treated successfully in primary care without the need for ear cleaning. Indeed, a recent study noted that only 3% of patients with acute otitis externa attending general practice in the UK needed referral to an ENT specialist (<LINK REF="REF-Rowlands-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowlands 2001</LINK>). The disproportionate number of secondary care trials in this review will affect the generalisability of the results to primary care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Follow-up period</HEADING>
<P>The follow-up period was variable. Most studies conducted an assessment at the end of treatment, followed by a further assessment, usually a week later, sometimes referred to as a 'test-of-cure visit'. Acute otitis externa is a condition where patients can develop relapse within a few weeks of the initial episode. One investigator performed an assessment of recurrence by telephoning patients at day 42 (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>). As this outcome measure could be influenced by several other factors (e.g. the patient returning to swimming) it is unlikely to provide a strong or direct indicator of a treatment's long-term benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Most trials did not report any adverse events. Those that did occur were usually mild and did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment. No trial reported any significant difference in treatment-related adverse events between intervention groups. No study reported contact dermatitis associated with neomycin or aminoglycosides.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Microbiology</HEADING>
<P>As with any randomised controlled trial, both groups should be reasonably matched at baseline to ensure that any observed therapeutic difference can be attributed entirely to the intervention(s) under review. Most studies ensured that parameters such as demographics and severity of disease were matched at entry. However, only a few studies compared bacteriological populations at baseline.</P>
<P>Six trials used a microbial outcome measure. One method employed was to determine the effectiveness of interventions' ability to reduce the pathogen count between entry and the end of treatment for each group as a whole. However, as this data does not relate to individual patient outcomes its usefulness is very limited.</P>
<P>Evaluation of microbial cures was the other method used. Microbial cures are those participants who had a positive baseline culture and returned at the end of treatment and were culture negative. However, there are potential flaws with this outcome measure that may limit the interpretation of such data. Firstly, there is the complex issue of whether organisms recovered in patients with acute otitis externa are actually responsible for the inflammation in all cases, or whether some are commensals which play no part in its pathogenesis.</P>
<P>Secondly, we know that changes in this surrogate endpoint do not rapidly and accurately reflect the clinical response to treatment; the incidence of bacteriologic cure tends to exceed the clinical response (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the persistence of bacteria in the ear canal following treatment does not necessarily imply persistent acute otitis externa symptoms or clinical failure.</P>
<P>Finally, both microbial and combined clinical-microbiological results are only generalisable to the microbiologically evaluable population. If applied to the clinically evaluable population the effect size is further reduced.</P>
<P>Despite all of this, it remains a useful measure to refer to when a clinically significant outcome is observed as one would expect the microbiological cure data to be concordant.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Intention-to-treat versus per-protocol analysis</HEADING>
<P>Intention-to-treat is a strategy for the analysis of randomised controlled trials that compares patients in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned regardless of whether they completed treatment, deviated from protocol, or withdrew from the study (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). Intention-to-treat analyses are generally preferred as they are unbiased and also because they address a more pragmatic and clinically relevant question (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2008</LINK>). We chose to use per-protocol denominators in the meta-analyses, as only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>) explicitly stated their intention-to-treat denominators. Use of intention-to-treat denominators, if they were available, would have reduced the pooled effect size in all related meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Generalisability</HEADING>
<P>Are the results of this review generalisable to a general practitioner treating a patient with acute otitis externa in primary care? As with any trial or systematic review, the results are only applicable to the specific population studied, the intervention(s) performed and the setting in which it was conducted. The generalisability of this review is restricted by a number of factors:</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria varied considerably between trials from none whatsoever to exhaustive lists of conditions. Results from studies with tight exclusion criteria will only truly be applicable to the restricted population studied.</P>
<P>Most of the studies were conducted in secondary care. It is conceivable that patients recruited from specialist clinics are likely to suffer from a more severe form of acute otitis externa compared to those attending their general practitioner. The extent to which the results of this review are generalisable to primary care is therefore somewhat diminished.</P>
<P>Cleaning of the ear canal was explicitly mentioned in 11 of the 19 trials. This practice is unlikely to be available in primary care where the vast majority of cases of acute otitis externa present. In this respect, the results of these 11 trials will not be truly applicable to those patients attending their general practitioner with the condition. However, one must take a reasoned view and temper this critique with the fact that trialists clean the ear canal at trial entry for pragmatic reasons. It allows an intact tympanic membrane to be visualised (and therefore a diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media to be excluded), permits assessment of the ear canal before treatment commences, and allows the response to treatment to be assessed. Indeed, one or more of these factors may have been the underlying reason why one of the primary care trialists chose to perform ear cleaning at the initial visit (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>) (the other trial conducted in primary care did not mention whether ear cleaning was performed). If we assume that removal of debris and discharge from the ear can make a topical drop more effective at treating acute otitis externa, then the results of this systematic review are likely to represent an overestimate of effect size.</P>
<P>As mentioned earlier, any microbial results are only generalisable to that smaller subset of patients that comprise the microbiologically evaluable population.</P>
<P>The microbiology of otitis externa varies across the world. Candida, aspergilli and other species of fungi are found in about 80% of tropical cases of otitis externa, but the proportion in the UK is much smaller (10% to 20%) (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 1979</LINK>). The vast majority of studies in this review were conducted in temperate climates and as such the results may not be applicable to other geographical locations.</P>
<P>Compliance was monitored in only a few studies. Although these data provide us with an indication of whether the medication was used, they do not inform us whether the drops were administered correctly. It is likely that drops were administered suboptimally and insufficiently in most trials, but this is likely to be a true reflection of how this occurs in real life, so is unlikely to affect the generalisability of the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pooling of data</HEADING>
<P>Trialists measured their outcomes on different days. The data from studies included in this review were only combined in meta-analysis if their interventions matched in terms of their constituent drug category and the data were taken from the same time interval. Statistical pooling of data was possible on three occasions, across two comparisons. Many studies reported symptom severity scores. Unfortunately these could not be combined statistically because of heterogeneity or incomplete reporting (e.g. no standard deviation).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity was found in our first meta-analysis. Initially it was not readily explainable and did not appear to be related to quality, study population or outcome measures. However, it became apparent that it was related to steroid potency. Consequently, only pooling of interventions containing similar steroid potencies was permitted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>During the writing of this review a systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa was published (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty trials met their inclusion criteria with 18 having data suitable for pooling. They investigated the following comparisons: antimicrobial versus placebo; antiseptic versus antimicrobial; quinolone antibiotic versus non-quinolone antibiotic; steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial; and antimicrobial-steroid versus steroid. All clinical comparisons except two were non-significant: antimicrobial versus placebo, and antimicrobial-steroid versus steroid. The authors concluded that topical antimicrobial therapy was highly effective at treating acute otitis externa. They also reported that steroid-only drops increased cure rates by 20% compared with steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI 3% to 38%). Minor differences in comparative efficacy between topical antimicrobials were noted but it was felt that these were unlikely to be of any clinical significance. Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared with non-quinolone antibiotics (95% CI 1% to 16%), but had statistically equivalent rates of clinical cure and adverse events.</P>
<P>The main differences between the systematic review and meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2006</LINK> and our review are as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>Identification of studies</B>
</P>
<P>We identified three additional studies published during their search period (1966 to July 2005) and included them in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Emgard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emgard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Olivera 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadsten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wadsten 1985</LINK>). Six trials published subsequent to their review have also been included (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Masood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Characteristics of included studies</B>
</P>
<P>Open trials were included in their review; we excluded them (<LINK REF="STD-Arnes-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Arnes 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emgard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Emgard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pistorius-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pistorius 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psifidis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Psifidis 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies with bilateral disease in which both ears were analysed were allowed in their review (<LINK REF="STD-Kime-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kime 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ordonez-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ordonez 1978</LINK>); we excluded them.</P>
<P>Their review permitted trials that included other diagnoses, where randomisation was not stratified by diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clayton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 1990</LINK>); we excluded them.</P>
<P>We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Ruth-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ruth 1990</LINK>. This study permitted aluminium acetate wicks for any case with a swollen ear canal as a prelude to the intervention assigned by randomisation. No detail was provided on the number of participants that required these wicks, the numbers in each group or their individual outcomes. We decided not to include this trial as this measure is likely to have confounded the overall result.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
</P>
<P>There are subtle but important differences in way in which the results were analysed. The "antiseptic versus antibiotic" comparison category in their review included treatments containing steroids. We chose to analyse trials containing steroid components separately as the steroid component will have had its own therapeutic effect and is likely to have confounded the result. This same applies to their "quinolone versus non-quinolone" comparison, which also included treatments containing steroids.</P>
<P>Overall these differences resulted in their review having 13 meta-analyses compared to only three in our review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Placebos</HEADING>
<P>Most trials compared active treatments. Three trials involved the use of a placebo. Of these, two investigated the efficacy of antibiotic/steroid drops; one trial used the drug's vehicle as placebo and the other a starch solution.</P>
<P>Although placebo controlled trials are considered by many to provide the best assessment of efficacy their use can be problematic. Firstly, the use of a placebo raises ethical issues; it leaves individuals who receive it, but are in need of actual medication for their condition, untreated. Furthermore, patients are less likely to participate in trials in which they may be randomised to an inactive treatment.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is not always easy to find a placebo that is inactive. Water or water-containing solutions (e.g. starch solution) may act as nocebos (cause a negative placebo effect) due to maceration of the ear canal. Some trialists have used the drug's vehicle as placebo. In <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1967</LINK>, the antibiotic/steroid group (with drug vehicle) achieved a 55% good response rate compared with 10% for the drug vehicle alone, the inference being that the true efficacy of the antibiotic/steroid by itself was 45%. The composition of drug vehicles can vary and consequently so can their therapeutic effect. Trials using drug vehicle placebos can therefore help us precisely quantify the effectiveness of the active ingredient.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Carrying agents</HEADING>
<P>In this review interventions were classified according to drug category. This was determined by the main active ingredient(s). The following groups were used: antiseptic (we included acidifying agents in this group), astringent, antibiotic, steroid, antifungal or combinations of the aforementioned. Although it is convenient to compartmentalise these medications to allow easier comparison, the whole premise may be over simplistic. It is important to realise that many treatments rely on a drug vehicle (carrying agent) and/or preservative in order for them to remain stable and be administrable in droplet or spray form. These chemicals (which include thonzonium bromide, benzalkonium chloride and propylene glycol) can have a therapeutic effect of their own. Indeed, the 10% cure rate observed in the drug vehicle group (placebo) in the trial performed by <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1967</LINK> is a case in point. Factors such as the pH of the solution may also have an effect.</P>
<P>One consequence of this naming strategy is that medications falling into a specific drug category (because they share a common active ingredient) could have different vehicles and preservatives associated with them. Consequently, whenever a statement is made regarding the efficacy a specific drug category it will not be a true reflection of the effectiveness of the main active ingredient.</P>
<P>In addition, for any given treatment it will be difficult to ascertain whether an observed therapeutic effect is wholly or only partly attributable to the 'active' ingredient. This raises the question of whether cures seen in trials using steroid-only drops are a result of the steroid's action on the underlying pathogenesis of acute otitis externa or due to the chemical preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, accompanying them. A trial comparing a steroid-only drop with its drug vehicle acting as a placebo would help clarify this.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-10 12:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-10 12:06:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>High quality level 1 evidence regarding interventions for acute otitis externa is sparse. The comparison categories studied in this review mostly contain single trials only. Only three meta-analyses were possible. Results are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. A number of significant results have 95% confidence intervals whose limits approach 1.0, suggesting that negligible differences cannot be excluded. A number of recent trials report results using P values that do not allow the magnitude or precision of the results to be evaluated, and as a result any findings merit cautious interpretation. The findings of this systematic review may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and 11 of the 19 trials had ear cleaning as part of the treatment. Having said all of this, a few salient points can be made from the evidence available:</P>
<P>Topical treatments alone are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. Additional oral antibiotics are not required.</P>
<P>In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observable differences in efficacy were minor and not consistently present at every assessment point.</P>
<P>Evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sabater-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sabater 1996</LINK>) of low quality found no difference in clinical efficacy between quinolone and non-quinolone drops. Quinolones are more expensive than non-quinolones. This finding may influence their use in cost-driven and resource-poor settings.</P>
<P>If treatment needs to be extended beyond one week acetic acid alone appears to perform less well when compared against other topical treatments. One high quality trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK>) compared acetic acid with antibiotic/steroid drops; although the cure rate was comparable at day seven to nine it was poorer in the acetic acid group at weeks two and three. A separate trial, of low quality, showed that acetic acid spray had a poorer cure rate than acetic acid/antibiotic/steroid spray at two and four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Slack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1987</LINK>). Acetic acid is available in many countries as a non-prescription remedy at low-cost, in both drop and spray form. The manufacturer recommends using it for a maximum of seven days. The results from <LINK REF="STD-van-Balen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Balen 2003</LINK> support their use for this duration. However, their study also showed that symptoms were more prolonged in the acetic acid group (eight days versus six days in the antibiotic/steroid group); this may influence the decision to use acetic acid in primary care.</P>
<P>There is some evidence which indicates that patients treated with topical antibiotic containing steroid benefit from reduced swelling (<LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2008</LINK>), severe redness, secretion and analgesic consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Mosges-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mosges 2007</LINK>) compared to their non-steroid counterpart. There is a suggestion that high-potency steroids may be more effective than low-potency steroids (in terms of severe pain, inflammation and swelling) (<LINK REF="STD-Roland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roland 2007</LINK>). Further investigation is required.</P>
<P>Evidence from one low quality trial (<LINK REF="STD-Masood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Masood 2008</LINK>) suggests a glycerine-ichthammol medicated wick may provide better pain relief in early severe acute otitis externa than a triamcinolone/gramicidin/neomycin/nystatin medicated wick, but the magnitude or precision of effect has yet to be established.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of ear cleaning is unknown. The evidence for the efficacy of steroid-only drops is scant and has not been fully established. Further investigation is warranted in order to quantify the effects of both these interventions fully.</P>
<P>In general, given the apparent parity in clinical efficacy of topical interventions used to treat acute otitis externa, other factors such as cost, availability, dosing regimen, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of resistance and risk of ototoxicity may determine the choice of therapy. Parameters such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.</P>
<P>Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Patients are usually treated for seven to 10 days, although it is apparent that they are cured at different time points. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after) for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-10 12:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Future trials should address a variety of general and more specific issues.</P>
<P>Adhering to the CONSORT statement improves the reporting of randomised controlled trials. Amongst other things it encourages the use of clear inclusion criteria, explicit randomisation schemes, full descriptions of drop-outs and withdrawals, and explicit reporting of adverse events. Use of confidence intervals is recommended<B> </B>in the CONSORT statement. A number of studies in this review used P values. The P value is limited in that it provides no information regarding the magnitude or precision of the result, and does not address how much the results would vary if the study were performed numerous times. It may indicate that a statistically significant result has been found, but in reality the difference could be so small as to be clinically meaningless.</P>
<P>Specifically, future trialists should attempt to address a clinically relevant hypothesis when designing a trial. Studies must state clearly their definition of acute otitis externa. Compliance should be closely monitored. Trialists should consider carefully how they handle bilateral disease in order to prevent a unit of analysis error. The use of additional outcome measures, such as time to recovery and pain relief, should be contemplated. Attempts should be made to perform intention-to-treat analyses. The cost-effectiveness of treatments, preferably through economic evaluations alongside clinical trials, would be valuable in guiding both clinical practice and health policy.</P>

<P>For the 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) group: instilled so that it was covering the tympanic membrane and filling the outer ear canal for a period of 10 to 15 seconds. The ear was then suctioned dry and then washed with 3% boric acid aqueous solution under microscopic control. In severe cases, a ribbon gauze soaked in 3% boric acid +/- antifungal drops was inserted for 3 days. After gauze removal the antifungal drops continued for 7 further days. For oedematous canals, additional 20% to 30% TCA instilled through gentle circular movements, facilitated by a cotton applicator. 17 tympanic membrane granulomas required repeated cauterisation with 20% to 30% TCA to a cotton applicator. Additional antibiotic was given to those severe cases with pinna cellulitis.</P>
<P>For the polymyxin B/neomycin/fluocinolone (Synalar®) group: number of drops not stated. Drops applied 3 times daily for 10 days. Severe cases ribbon gauze soaked with Synalar was inserted into the canal and removed after 3 days.</P>
