<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Not taking enough physical activity leads to an increased risk of a number of chronic diseases including coronary heart disease. Regular physical activity can reduce this risk and also provide other physical and possibly mental health benefits. The majority of adults are not active at recommended levels. The findings of this review indicate that professional advice and guidance with continued support can encourage people to be more physically active in the short to mid-term. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion work best in the long-term to encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Little is known about the effectiveness of strategies to enable people to achieve and maintain recommended levels of physical activity.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote physical activity in adults aged 16 years and older, not living in an institution.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library (</I>issue 1 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, BIDS ISI, SPORTDISCUS, SIGLE, SCISEARCH (from earliest dates available to December 2004). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials that compared different interventions to encourage sedentary adults not living in an institution to become physically active. Studies required a minimum of six months follow up from the start of the intervention to the collection of final data and either used an intention-to-treat analysis or, failing that, had no more than 20% loss to follow up.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>At least two reviewers independently assessed each study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous measures of self-reported physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The effect of interventions on self-reported physical activity (19 studies; 7598 participants) was positive and moderate (pooled SMD random effects model 0.28 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) as was the effect of interventions (11 studies; 2195 participants) on cardio-respiratory fitness (pooled SMD random effects model 0.52 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90). There was significant heterogeneity in the reported effects as well as heterogeneity in characteristics of the interventions. The heterogeneity in reported effects was reduced in higher quality studies, when physical activity was self-directed with some professional guidance and when there was on-going professional support. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Our review suggests that physical activity interventions have a moderate effect on self-reported physical activity, on achieving a predetermined level of physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions. Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-14 10:05:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Regular physical activity can play an important role both in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, diabetes mellitus, obesity, stroke, some cancers, and osteoporosis, as well as improve the lipid profile (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Folsom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folsom 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FNB-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">FNB 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-US-Dept.-Health-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Dept. Health 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). A meta-analysis of the relationship between physical activity and coronary heart or cardiovascular disease reported a 30% lower risk for the most physically active versus the least physically activity (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>). In addition, physical inactivity has been estimated to cause, globally, about 22% of ischaemic heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The English Chief Medical Officer (CMO) advises that adults should undertake at least 30 minutes of 'moderate intensity' (5.0-7.5 kcal/min) physical activity on at least 5 days of the week to benefit their health (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>). The recommendations are similar to those published in the US and by the World Health Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-Pate-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pate 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-US-Dept.-Health-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Dept. Health 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>In England the prevalence of physical activity at recommended levels is low. The most recent data show that only 37% of men and 25% of women meet the CMO's physical activity recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2005a</LINK>). Local government authorities have been set a target to 'increase the number of adults who engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity level sport three times a week, by 3% by 2008' (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HM-Treasury-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">HM Treasury 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of physical activity in the management of specific diseases, notably hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and CVD (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>). These show the effects of exercise on various physiological and biological outcomes and demonstrate the importance of exercise in the management of disease. However, because the main outcome of these trials is not physical activity, they do not help us understand the effectiveness of physical activity promotion strategies in the general population. A number of Cochrane reviews have assessed the relationship of the effects of exercise upon type 2 diabetes and as part of cardiac rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Jolliffe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolliffe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>One recent published review examined the evidence for the effectiveness of 'home based' versus 'centre based' physical activity programs on the health of older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 2005</LINK>). Study participants had to have either a recognised cardiovascular risk factor, or existing cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD) or osteoarthritis. The authors found six trials involving 224 participants who received a 'home based' exercise program and 148 who received a 'centre based' exercise program. They concluded there was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions in support of either home or centre based physical activity programs. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of interventions for physical activity promotion in adults aged 16 and above, not living in an institution, with no intervention, minimal intervention or attention control.<BR/> <BR/>If sufficient trials existed, the following secondary objectives were to be explored:</P>
<P>a) Are more intense interventions more effective in changing physical activity than less intense interventions (e.g. a greater frequency and duration of professional contact and support v single contact)?</P>
<P>b) Are specific components of interventions associated with changes in physical activity behaviour (e.g. prescribed v self determined physical activity, supervised v unsupervised physical activity)?</P>
<P>c) Are short-term changes in physical activity or fitness (e.g. less than 3 months from intervention, less than 6 months from intervention) maintained at 12 months?</P>
<P>d) Is the promotion of some types of physical activity more likely to lead to change than other types of physical activity (e.g. walking versus exercise classes)?</P>
<P>e) Are home-based interventions more successful than facility-based interventions?</P>
<P>f) Are interventions more successful with particular participant groups (e.g. women, older, minority)?</P>

<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2005) , MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2004), CINAHL (January 1982 to December 2004), PsycLIT (1887 to December 2004), BIDS ISI (January 1973 to December 2004), SPORTDISCUS (January 1980 to December 2004), SIGLE (January 1980 to December 2004) and SCISEARCH (January 1980 to December 2004), and reference lists of articles. Hand searching was conducted on one journal <I>Medicine and Science in Sport and Exercise</I> from 1990 to December 2004. Published systematic reviews of physical activity interventions were used as a source of randomised controlled trials. Reference lists of all relevant articles, books and personal contact with authors were also used. All languages were included.</P>
<P>The search strategy below was used to search MEDLINE, with the addition of an RCT filter (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1995</LINK>).

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All abstracts were reviewed independently by two investigators who applied the following criteria to determine if the full paper was needed for further investigation:<BR/>a) did the study aim to examine the effectiveness of a physical activity promotion strategy to increase physical activity behaviour?<BR/>b) did the study have a control group (e.g. a no intervention control, attention control and/or minimal intervention control group)?<BR/>c) did the study allocate participants into intervention or control groups by a method of randomisation?<BR/>d) did the study include adults of 16 years or older?<BR/>e) did the study recruit adults not living in institutions and free of chronic disease?<BR/>f) was the study's main outcome physical activity or physical fitness?<BR/>g) were the main outcome(s) measured at least 6 months after the start of the intervention?<BR/>h) did the study analyse the results by intention-to-treat or, failing that was there less than 20% loss to follow up?</P>
<P>Two reviewers examined a hard copy of every paper that met the inclusion criteria on the basis of the abstract alone (or title and keywords if no abstract was available). When a final group of papers was identified all papers were reviewed again by two reviewers independently. Any disagreement at this stage was discussed between the three reviewers and resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>From the final set of studies that met the inclusion criteria, study details were extracted independently by two reviewers onto a standard form. Again any disagreements were discussed between three reviewers and resolved by consensus. Extracted data included date and location of study, study design variables, methodological quality, characteristics of participants (age, gender, ethnicity), intervention strategies, frequency and type of intervention and follow-up contacts, degree of physical activity supervision, study outcome measure, effectiveness of intervention and adverse events.</P>
<P>We wrote to and received clarification from 11 authors of the studies selected for the review. Our requests focused on data missing or unclear from the published papers and included data on study numbers at final analysis, means and standard deviations for intervention and control arms. For incomplete responses, we wrote again to authors asking for further data. </P>
<P>We found different types of outcome results published in two included papers for the Sendai Silver Centre Trial (<LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>). Tsuji 2000 reported changes in cardiovascular fitness and Fujita 2003 reported increases in self-reported physical activity.</P>
<P>Outcomes were analysed both as continuous outcomes and as dichotomous outcomes (active/sedentary) wherever possible. Standard statistical approaches were adopted:</P>
<P>(a) For each study with continuous outcomes; a standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. If the study had more than two arms then the overall effects of the intervention versus control (means and standard deviations) were examined by pooling the individual effect of each intervention arm (means and standard deviations). These pooled groups means and standard deviations were weighted for overall numbers within each arm (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Pooled effect sizes were calculated as standardised mean differences with 95% CI using a random-effects model. </P>
<P>(b) For each study with dichotomous outcomes; an odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated. Pooled effect sizes were calculated as ORs and with 95% CI using a random-effects model.</P>
<P>We examined five thematic characteristics of each intervention to try to assess if they modified the main effects of the interventions. These five characteristics were the nature of direction at first contact, degree of programme supervision, frequency of intervention occasions, frequency of follow-up contacts and type of follow-up contacts. </P>
<P>We described the nature of the initial contact between the participant and professional/researcher as "the nature of direction". We found three types of intervention: (i) self-directed only - where the participant is not directed in their choices and thinking about which physical activities to start by the professional; (ii) self-directed plus professional guidance - where the participant can make a decision about their physical activity using a mixture of both self direction and professional advice and guidance; and (iii) prescribed by professional only - the participant receives the advice and prescription of physical activity from the professional.</P>
<P>We wanted to evaluate the type and supervision of physical activity adopted within studies. We developed three categories of programme supervision: (i) structured and supervised - the physical activity programme was structured and supervised by professional; (ii) unsupervised and independent - the physical activity programme was unstructured and performed independently by the participant; and (iii) mixed - the physical activity programme was both structured and supervised and unstructured and independent. </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>From 35,524 hits, 287 papers were retrieved for examination against the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Thirty three papers describing 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. We were unable to secure the requested information from five studies. <LINK REF="STD-Halbert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 2000</LINK> was not contactable and so this study is not presented in the final results. Four studies sent data but the data was incomplete or inappropriate for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowther-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Lowther 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowther-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lowther 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nies-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nies 2003</LINK>).

All 29 studies were randomised controlled trials. Two papers each reported the results of two separate trials (<LINK REF="STD-King-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). Two papers reported different outcomes for one study (<LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Participants of included studies<BR/>
</B>11,513 apparently healthy adults participated in the 29 included studies. The majority of studies recruited both genders with three studies recruiting men only (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>) and four studies recruiting women only (<LINK REF="STD-Inoue-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). The stated age range of participants was from 18 to 95 years. Details on ethnic group of participants were reported in 13 studies, with proportions of participants in ethnic minorities ranging from 3% to 55%. Participants were recruited from four settings; primary healthcare, workplaces, university and the community (see <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions in included studies<BR/>
</B>We found a marked heterogeneity in the interventions used in each study. Studies used one, or combination of, one-to-one counselling/advice or group counselling/advice; self-directed or prescribed physical activity; supervised or unsupervised physical activity; home-based or facility-based physical activity; ongoing face-to-face support; telephone support; written education/motivation material; self monitoring. The intervention was delivered by one or a number of practitioners with various professional backgrounds including physicians, nurses, health educators, counsellors, exercise leaders and peers. </P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>) adopted a structured and supervised approach to their intervention, encouraging participants to cycle on a static bike for 10 to 25 minutes at a pre-determined intensity, as part of a 2-hour exercise session. The majority of studies adopted an unstructured and independently performed physical activity regime. </P>
<P>We found the majority of studies contacted participants on at least three or more occasions in the first 4 weeks of the intervention to support and encourage any adoption of physical activity. Studies offered a range of support and follow up to participants between week 5 and final outcome measure (a minimum of 6 months post baseline intervention). The types of follow-up offered to participants at any point ranged from postal only, telephone only, face-to-face meetings, or a mixture of postal, telephone or face-to-face. </P>
<P>We found an even distribution of studies using all three approaches as described in our explanation of 'nature of direction' with the more recently published studies preferring self direction or self direction with professional guidance.</P>
<P>
<B>Design of included studies</B>
<BR/>Nine studies had a no-contact control group. Five studies had attention control groups with control participants receiving non-exercise related health advice. The remaining studies had comparison control groups, where participants received advice or written information about physical activity. In <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK> the control participants received exercise counselling and advice and were asked to keep a diary. </P>
<P>Eight studies had more than one intervention arm (<LINK REF="STD-Dubbert--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harland-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>). Four studies conducted an analysis of any intervention vs control by combining intervention arms (<LINK REF="STD-Harland-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>). We calculated pooled results for intervention arms for three further studies (<LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). Our analysis of effectiveness when combining intervention arms, differed from the original results presented by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). We also combined the results of two studies as the final results for control and intervention groups were reported separately by gender and there was no <I>a priori</I> hypothesis that the effect of the intervention would be different for men and women (<LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures<BR/>
</B>A number of secondary outcome measures, which were not the focus of this review, were also measured and included body mass index (<LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>), health status, smoking status (<LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>), socio-behavioural constructs (e.g. self efficacy, reduction in barriers to physical activity), social support and 'stage of change' (<LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>), time spent in flexibility and strength training (<LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK>), weight, height, lean body mass, body fat, plasma lipids (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>), minute ventilation, maximal heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, blood cholesterol, flexibility, grip strength, health conditions, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>), and alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Two of the three reviewers independently assessed the quality of each study that met the inclusion criteria. We did not rate studies on whether participants were blind to their allocation to intervention or control groups. This would not be appropriate for studies of this type, as it would be impossible to blind participants to a physical activity intervention. Generation of a formal quality score for each study was completed on a four point scale assigning a value of 0 or 1 to each of the factors described below. </P>
<P>a) Was the randomisation method described? <BR/>All studies reported using randomisation to allocate participants to intervention and control groups, but only 16 described the method of randomisation. Of these, four studies used cluster-randomisation, where the unit of randomisation was participating practices (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>), matched pairs of participating practices (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1999</LINK>), or workplace shifts (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1979</LINK>). One study used quasi-randomisation - days of the week (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>). All other studies randomised individuals.</P>
<P>b) Was the outcome assessment independent and blind? <BR/>Twelve studies reported independent and blind outcome assessments (<LINK REF="STD-Dubbert--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harland-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>c) Was the final outcome measure controlled for baseline physical activity? <BR/>Sixteen studies reported adjusting their final results for baseline values of physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inoue-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>d) Was the analysis an intention-to-treat analysis?<BR/>Fourteen studies reported using an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1998</LINK>). The remaining nine studies did not use an intention-to-treat analysis but had less than 20% loss to follow up. The proportion of participants in studies that did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis who were lost to follow up ranged from 0% to 18.9% (see <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty-three studies reported data for the number of those participants who completed their study and the number of participants eligible for the study before randomisation. We calculated the proportion of the eligible participants who completed the study and this percentage ranged from 15.5% to 100%. <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK> presents the numbers of participants at different stages of each study. This data included the number of participants contacted to determine potential eligibility, number identified as eligible for study, number randomised, number with complete data at final outcome measure, number of participants with complete data at final outcome measure as a proportion of number identified as eligible for study and proportion of participants who were lost to follow-up.</P>

<I>Reported as a continuous measure</I>
</B> <BR/>Nineteen studies (7,598 participants) reported their main outcome as one of several continuous measures of physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inoue-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>). Measures included estimated energy expenditure (kcals/day, kcals/week of moderate physical activity), total time of physical activity (mean mins/week of moderate physical activity) and mean number of occasions of physical activity in past four weeks. The pooled effect of these studies was positive but moderate (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) with significant heterogeneity in observed effects (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 83.5%). Seven studies reported positive effects (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies with positive SMDs used a range of different intervention approaches with varying effect sizes. <LINK REF="STD-Kriska-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kriska 1986</LINK> found that encouraging walking via an 8-week training programme, followed by a choice of group or independent walking, plus follow-up phone calls and incentives resulted in a mean increase of 479 kcal/week (95% CI 249 to 708) of physical activity of all intensities. <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK> found that encouragement to attend three group exercise sessions per week and perform an additional weekly exercise session at home resulted in an additional mean 53.7 minutes of vigorous physical activity per day (95% CI 18.09 to 89.31). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-King-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988a</LINK> found a mean increase of 3.90 exercise sessions per month (95% CI 0.43 to 7.37), at 6 months, following 30 minutes of baseline instruction (15 minutes of advice and a 15 minute video about exercise training), and daily self monitoring of physical activity using exercise logs returned to staff every month. These additional sessions were approximately equivalent to 101 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1998</LINK> saw a net difference between intervention and control groups of 2.31 'sessions' (one session was at least 20 minutes of continuous physical activity) of moderate or vigorous exercise per month (95% CI 1.91 to 2.71). At an initial meeting with a community exercise development officer intervention participants were encouraged to extend a physical activity that they already did rather than start a new activity. A further meeting was offered ten weeks later to support and encourage any changes. <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK> reported a significant net difference of 82 kcal per day between the intervention and control arms (95% CI 73.9 to 90.1). The intervention group received face-to-face counselling based on social cognitive theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>). In addition they were offered further individual follow up appointments, educational materials, phone calls and monthly workshops about physical activity. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK> reported a between group mean difference of 2.67 kcal/kg/wk (95% CI 0.48 to 4.86). The authors estimate this was equivalent to a net difference of 247 kcals/week between groups. The intervention group received motivational counselling from their general practitioner, followed by three follow up phone calls from a local exercise specialist, plus written materials. Participants were asked to choose their own physical activity. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK> reported a large increase in mean self-reported physical activity in their intervention group. However the physical activity regime was very prescriptive. Participants were encouraged to attend at least two from three 2-hour exercise classes per week, held at a local community centre. The class contained endurance and resistance training typically involving 10-25 minutes of static cycling at prescribed heart rate reserve, with intensity monitored by heart monitors. In addition to attending classes participants were asked to monitor their walking behaviour using pedometers.</P>

<I>Reported as a dichotomous measure</I>
</B>
<BR/>Ten studies (3595 participants) reported physical activity as a dichotomous measure which represented achievement or not of a predetermined level of physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-Dubbert--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harland-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). The pooled odds ratio of these studies was positive but modest (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.72) with significant heterogeneity in observed effects (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 53.4%).

<B>Cardio-respiratory fitness </B>
<BR/>In addition to self-reported physical activity, 11 studies (2195 participants) examined the effect of their intervention on cardio-respiratory fitness (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dubbert--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>). The pooled effect was again positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity in the observed effects (SMD 0.52 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90). Five studies (1359 participants) had significant positive effects that favoured treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1987</LINK> reported that recently retired men who were offered supervised exercise sessions increased their fitness by a greater amount than controls who continued with their usual physical activity programmes (SMD 0.44 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72). <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK> found a mean increase in fitness (SMD 1.49 95% CI 1.07 to 1.91) for participants who received a combination of a 30-minute consultation, an educational video, information on using a heart rate monitor and a daily physical activity log, compared to controls. <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK> found that women who received an intensive mixture of behavioural counselling, support materials and telephone calls (assistance + counselling arms) were more likely to increase their fitness (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71) than women who received a less intensive intervention (advice arm only). <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK> evaluated the effects of a fitness assessment using a step test and counselling from physician, plus a simple target heart rate goal and recording their physical activity in a diary on cardio-respiratory fitness. Controls received the same intervention without the heart rate goal setting. The standardised mean difference was 1.87 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.15).</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK> reported a significant difference in VO2 max between intervention and control group at 12-months follow-up this difference did not remain when based on the standardised mean difference of the pooled intervention arms (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.43). In one other study (<LINK REF="STD-King-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">King 1988b</LINK>), the author reported a significant difference in the change in fitness between groups, which did not remain significant when based on standardised mean differences at 12 month follow up using their published data. This may be an effect of pooling study arms.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events<BR/>
</B>Eight studies reported data on adverse events. Only one study found a difference in the rate of adverse events between the intervention and control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1979</LINK> reported the rate of job-related injuries was four times higher in the control group compared to the intervention group. The other seven studies reported no significant difference in rates of musculoskeletal injury (fractures and sprains), falls, illness and potential cardiovascular events between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Dubbert--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSCT-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SSCT 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis by study quality</B>
<BR/>We examined the pooled effects for the three types of outcome data (self-reported physical activity, dichotomous and cardio-respiratory fitness outcomes) by an assessment of study quality. High quality studies scored more than 2 on the quality scale. A score of 2 or less was categorised as low quality. For the 19 studies that reported continuous outcomes for physical activity six were classified as high quality (comparison 02 01). The pooled effect of these interventions was again positive with no significant heterogeneity in the observed effects; the standardised mean difference was 0.11 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.17). Lower quality studies also had a positive pooled effect but with significant heterogeneity in the observed effects; the standardised mean difference was 0.36 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.56).</P>
<P>We found three high quality scoring studies from the 10 studies that reported dichotomous outcome data for self-reported physical activity (comparison 02 02). The pooled odds ratio of these three studies was positive but modest (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.06) with no significant heterogeneity in observed effects. </P>
<P>We found five high quality studies from the 11 studies that reported continuous outcome data for cardio-respiratory fitness (comparison 02 03). The pooled effects of these studies was not significant and there was significant heterogeneity (SMD 0.54, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.14). We noted two studies had a string effect on the pooled analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary objectives</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>a) Are more intense interventions more effective in changing physical activity than less intense interventions?</I>
</B>
<BR/>Two studies attempted to investigate the effect of increasing intervention intensity. In <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK> the three groups received different levels of intervention. The control group (advice) received physician advice to achieve the recommended level for exercise, then referral to an on-site health educator. At this appointment the health educator provided educational materials and repeated the physician advice to exercise with further follow-up appointments repeating this advice. No other follow-up activities were offered. The assistance group received the same advice from a physician and also received a 30-40 minute counselling session the health educator conducted, including a videotape and action planning. Participants then received follow-up phone calls, interactive mail, an electronic step counter, and monthly monitoring cards, which were returned to the health educator. Follow-up mail and incentives were sent to all participants. The counselling group received all of the components of the advice and assistance group with additional bi-weekly telephone calls for 6 weeks and then monthly telephone calls up to 12 months. Frequency of telephone calls for the final 12 months of the study was negotiated between the participant and their health educator. Weekly behavioural classes on skills for adopting and maintaining physical activity were also offered to this group. In women, the addition of behavioural counselling, follow up support and materials produced a significant difference in fitness compared to the control groups. In men addition of these components did not lead to greater change (<LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>b) Are specific components of interventions associated with changes in physical activity behaviour?</I>
</B>
<BR/>We stratified the behavioural components of the interventions, according to a number of characteristics. These characteristics were the degree of nature of direction (the extent to which physical activity was prescribed or self-directed) and the level of on-going professional support (frequency of follow up after week five of the study). Although there were insufficient studies to statistically test the difference in observed effects between these various study characteristics, the significant heterogeneity in reported effects was reduced when physical activity was self-directed with some professional guidance and when there was on-going professional support (in studies with continuous outcome measures for self-reported physical activity). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>c) Are short term changes in physical activity or fitness maintained at 12 months?</I>
</B>
<BR/>Six studies reported outcomes more than 6 months after the initial intervention (e.g. at least a measure of the primary outcome at 6 months and 12 months post intervention). In <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK> improvements in physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness at 6 months were maintained at 12 months for cardio-respiratory fitness only. <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK> presented data for cardio-respiratory fitness and self-reported physical activity at 6 and 24 months. All three study arms increased their cardio respiratory fitness and self reported levels of physical activity between baseline and 6 months. However there were no significant differences between groups. At 24 months there was a significant difference in VO2 max between participants who received assistance and counselling compared to the advice group for women only (<LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK> reported outcomes at 12 and 24 months with no significant effect observed at either time points. <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK> reported no significant effect in the likelihood of increasing walking at 6 and 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK> reported a significant increase in cardio-respiratory fitness at 6 months and this effect was further increased at 12 months. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>d) Is the promotion of some types of physical activity more likely to lead to change than other types of physical activity?</I>
</B>
<BR/>We were unable to determine if any type of physical activity is more likely to be adopted than any other type of physical activity, (e.g. walking, jogging or running) as the studies were not designed to examine this question and as such generally did not report exactly what type of physical activity was performed.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>e) Are home-based interventions more successful than facility-based interventions?</I>
</B>
<BR/>No study specifically examined this question. However <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK> compared the difference in adherence to prescribed physical activity sessions between participants who were prescribed home-based versus facility-based exercise. A greater number of participants completed at least 75% of prescribed exercise sessions in both home-based arms compared to the facility-based arms (P &lt; 0.05). This improved adherence to the home-based exercise sessions was not reflected in greater improvements in fitness.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>f) Are interventions more successful with particular participant groups?</I>
</B>
<BR/>Nine studies examined the differential effects of the interventions within various sub-groups.</P>
<P>Eight studies looked at the effect of gender (<LINK REF="STD-Calfas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calfas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>). Greater effects were seen for improvements in cardio-respiratory fitness for women as compared to men in <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>, while <LINK REF="STD-Juneau-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Juneau 1987</LINK> reported a greater increase in VO2 max in men than women. <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK> reported greater increases in men compared to women in the intervention group in reported physical activity. </P>
<P>Two studies found no differential effects between high and low levels of baseline self-reported physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>). No effects were seen for age (above or below 75 years) in <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>. The same study found a greater increase in physical activity for overweight participants (BMI more than 27.0), compared with participants who were not overweight (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK> examined differential effects of their intervention in four sub groups (i) gender, (ii) age (above versus below 70 years), (iii) chronic health conditions (less than two reported health conditions versus more two or more health conditions) and (iv) BMI (&lt;27, 27-31, &gt;32 BMI). The intervention group showed a greater improvement in cardio-respiratory fitness compared to the control group, in a between group analysis regardless of gender, age, having more than 2 chronic health conditions and BMI &gt;32. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Our updated review suggests that physical activity interventions have a positive moderate sized effect on increasing self-reported physical activity and measured cardio-respiratory fitness, at least in the short to mid-term. Any conclusions drawn from this review require some caution given the significant heterogeneity in the observed effects. Despite the heterogeneity between the studies, there is some indication that a mixture of professional guidance and self direction plus on-going professional support leads to more consistent effect estimates. The long-term effectiveness of these interventions is not established as the majority of studies stopped after 12 months. </P>
<P>These conclusions differ from the findings of previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hillsdon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillsdon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillsdon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillsdon 1999</LINK>). Earlier reviews concluded that interventions that encouraged home-based activity were more effective than facility-based activity interventions. This review used more rigid inclusion criteria (for example outcome measures with at least 6 months follow-up) and subsequently excluded some studies included in these previous reviews. We were also able to collect unpublished data from study authors and this allowed us to perform a quantitative analysis using standardised mean differences for effects as opposed to just descriptions alone. The conclusions are similar to another published review (<LINK REF="REF-Hillsdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillsdon 2004</LINK>). However this review was not a synthesis of primary studies but rather a synthesis of high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies to increase physical activity among adults. It assessed studies in particular settings and found strong evidence of effectiveness of interventions within healthcare and community settings, particularly brief advice from a health professional, supported by written materials, which is likely to be effective in producing a modest, short-term (6-12 weeks) effect on physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Hillsdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillsdon 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The findings of this review are in contrast to the conclusions of a review produced by the Center for Disease Control (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2002</LINK> examined the effectiveness of individual-based behavioural interventions for the promotion of physical activity. The review calculated effects as the net percent change from baseline - the median change scores. In 10 studies (using continuous outcome measures of self-reported physical activity), the authors found a median net increase of 35.4% (interquartile range, 16.7% to 83.3%). Ten studies measured change in the time spent in physical activity, with a net median increase of 64.3% (interquartile range, 1.2% to 85.5%). Four studies measured change in VO2max with a median increase of 6.3% (interquartile range, 5.1% to 9.8%). Overall the authors concluded that there was "good" evidence to suggest that this type of intervention was effective in increasing physical activity. However the authors included studies with shorter periods of follow up, non randomised studies (including uncontrolled before and after studies), and did not take account of loss to follow up. Only one study, <LINK REF="STD-King-1991" TYPE="STUDY">King 1991</LINK>, was shared by both reviews.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The quality of the studies in this current review was limited by a lack of intention-to-treat analysis and failure to examine the interaction between baseline levels of physical activity and exposure to the intervention. Only six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrella-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Petrella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>) achieved all of the quality criteria. The observed effects were smaller but more consistent in studies with higher quality scores.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Internal validity</I>
</B>
<BR/>We found three main weaknesses to the studies in terms of their internal validity. First, none of the studies were able to blind participants to their allocation to intervention at baseline. However this criterion is not appropriate to such studies. It is very difficult to blind a participant to their study group if exercise is the intervention. This element of quality is more appropriate to pharmaceutical interventions where blinding for both researchers and participants reduces the risk of selection bias. Second, studies failed to state their randomisation methods. And third, the studies did not use personnel to collect main outcome measures that were independent and blinded to group allocation.</P>
<P>Misclassification of physical activity also threatens internal validity of studies. The insensitivity of self-reported physical activity measures leads to less precision in its measurement and increases the variance in measures of behaviour. As intervention and control group participants completed the same self-report measure, any misclassification is likely to be non-differential leading to an attenuation of the effect of the intervention. This problem would not apply to measures of cardio-respiratory fitness.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>External validity</I>
</B>
<BR/>Limitations in the external validity of the studies relate to recruitment and screening of participants and the generalisability of the interventions into everyday practice.</P>
<P>The majority of the studies in the review recruited volunteers, for example people replying to newspaper advertisements and the interventions may be less effective in non-volunteer populations recruited, for example, from primary care settings. Often participants had to agree to extensive screening prior to randomisation and, as a consequence, the people who finally participated in the study were likely to be highly motivated. Participants who were randomised in Project ACT (<LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>) had already undergone three screening visits. Participants in other studies attended pre-study promotional events plus a baseline assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2001</LINK>) or attended two screening interviews (<LINK REF="STD-Inoue-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 2003</LINK>). By contrast, only three studies, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hillsdon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hillsdon 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2003</LINK>, randomised all participants at the point of invitation to the study prior to them agreeing to participate. This method is called Zelen randomisation and is adopted to reduce non-consent rates (<LINK REF="REF-Zelen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelen 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physicians in the studies based in a primary healthcare setting may have been more motivated to deliver the interventions than might be observed in a non-trial setting. We noted that studies described 'recruiting' participating practices and physicians and reported using financial incentives to physicians and practice staff during the time of the study.</P>
<P>We noted a large drop out of participants between the recruitment, eligibility screening and randomisation phases of studies (data presented in <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). This drop out would limit the possible effects of such interventions and the generalisability of the studies. </P>
<P>Many interventions provided components which would be difficult to deliver in usual practice as they would demand large resources. For example studies offered a choice of physical activities plus offered initial support in supervised programmes of physical activity, as well as letting participants choose to exercise independently of professional support. </P>
<P>Only four studies reported data at 2 years, with one study demonstrating maintenance of improvement in cardio-respiratory fitness (<LINK REF="STD-Simons_x002d_Morton-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Simons-Morton 2001b</LINK>). Evidence for the long-term effectiveness of interventions is urgently required.</P>
<P>The participants in the studies reviewed were generally white, well educated and middle aged and it is possible that the observed effects may be different in the wider population. There were no studies in this review that examined the effectiveness of interventions in minority groups of any kind.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that interventions designed to increase physical activity can lead to moderate short and mid-term increases in physical activity, at least in middle age. Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions. Nevertheless interventions which provide people with professional guidance about starting an exercise programme and then provide on going support may be more effective in encouraging the uptake of physical activity. There is no evidence that such interventions will reduce physical activity or cause other harm. There is only very limited evidence of the long-term effectiveness of interventions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Existing evidence about the effectiveness of physical activity interventions for sedentary adults in the general population is limited by the recruitment of motivated volunteers, and the problems of measuring of physical activity using self report. No studies examined the effect of interventions on participants from varying socioeconomic or ethnic groups. There is also an urgent need for studies with cost-effectiveness data. In order to better understand the independent effect of individual programme components, longer studies with greater power are required. High quality studies are required with larger numbers, with a greater variety of participants, and with longer follow-up periods. In this review we have been able to describe the quantity of the interventions but were unable to describe the quality of the components of the interventions. Future reports of studies should provide greater detail on the nature of the professional who delivered the interventions, the theoretical basis of the intervention and how the theory was translated into practice.</P>
