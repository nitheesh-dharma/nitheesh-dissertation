<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Vaginal dilators and intercourse are useful for alleviating post-radiotherapy vaginal problems, but more evidence is required to assess oestrogens and benzydamine</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The physical side effects of radiotherapy to the female pelvis may lead to difficulty and/or pain during intercourse. Studies of treatments (vaginal oestrogens, benzydamine douches, dilators, and intercourse) were neither recent nor good quality. This review endorses the current recommendation of using dilators and/or intercourse to prevent vaginal narrowing, however although some studies recommend the use of vaginal oestrogen or benzydamine douches, they are not statistically significant and large randomized trials are required to assess their effectiveness.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-20 10:40:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The concepts used included synonyms for radiation therapy and brachytherapy and synonyms for the spectrum of physical aspects of sexual dysfunction in women. randomized. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), Issue 1, 2002, MEDLINE 1966 to 2002, EMBASE 1980 to 2002, CANCERCD 1980 to 2002, Science Citation Index 1991 to 2002, CINAHL 1982 to 2002, as well as sources of grey literature. We also hand searched relevant textbooks and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Any study describing the therapeutic trial of a treatment to relieve the physical aspects of female sexual dysfunction which had developed following pelvic radiotherapy was considered. The quality of each study was then assessed by two reviewers independently to determine its suitability for inclusion in statistical analysis. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Thirty-two references met the inclusion criteria for the search but of these only four were suitable to be included for statistical analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The strongest evidence for benefit is the grade IC data in the topical oestrogens and benzydamine sections which describes the treatment of acute radiation vaginal changes. The use of vaginal dilators to prevent the development of vaginal stenosis is supported by grade IIC evidence. The value of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgical reconstruction is supported by the much weaker grade IIIC evidence in the form of case series. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>These findings reflect the quality of published data regarding interventions for this aspect of the management of radiation induced complications. Although there is grade IC evidence, these studies are not recent, the allocation concealment is unclear in the text, and overall there is a variable level of assessment of the response, emphasising the need for more studies to be conducted with improved designs to clarify the investigative process and support the final result. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-20 11:04:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following pelvic radiotherapy, a proportion of women experience problems related to sexual function, which are multifactorial in origin. The physical components of this relate to distortion of the perineum and vagina, which may occur as a result of surgery and/or radiotherapy and compromises sexual activity resulting in considerable distress (<LINK REF="REF-Bergmark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergmark 1999</LINK>). The rapid cell turnover of the vaginal and vulval epithelium allows for natural exfoliation of the outer most layers of non-dividing cells and makes the epithelium very sensitive to the effects of radiation. There are two phases of radiation toxicity, the acute reaction occurs during the course of radiotherapy and for a few months afterwards. In contrast, the late reaction may follow on from the acute reaction for a minimum period of three months or develop after a symptom free interval of not less than three months from completion of radiotherapy.</P>
<P>The following symptoms and presentations contributing to sexual dysfunction evolve over months to years after completion of treatment:</P>
<UL>
<LI>vaginal dryness</LI>
<LI>atrophic vaginitis</LI>
<LI>vaginal/vulval ulceration or necrosis</LI>
<LI>vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina)</LI>
<LI>shortened vaginal canal</LI>
<LI>dyspareunia i.e. pain related to sexual intercourse</LI>
<LI>postcoital bleeding (bleeding after sexual intercourse)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The acute radiation reaction may produce any of the listed spectrum of symptoms but is dominated by vaginal and vulval mucositis (inflammation of the mucosa), pain and ulceration. The presentation of late side effects is dominated by fibrosis, loss of elasticity and sensation producing vaginal shortening and stenosis, telangiectasia (fragile superficial blood vessels), postcoital bleeding and pain on intercourse. Increased susceptibility to trauma and infection are not uncommon although poorly reported so that the true prevalence is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Grigsby-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigsby 1995</LINK>). These manifestations are often compounded further by the effects of radiation induced ovarian failure which results in decreased vaginal lubrication and thinning of the vaginal epithelium. Although there are few statistics on the frequency of this type of toxicity, the acute reaction is reported relatively frequently as it is associated with discomfort, easily recognised and by definition self-limiting. However the development of late complications may be more insidious or difficult to diagnose and therefore often poorly documented. Certain risk factors predispose to susceptibility for late toxicity and include diabetes, arterial disease and tumour bulk.</P>
<P>While concentrating on tumour response, discussion of sexual issues may be cursory, or be considered awkward or embarrassing to address because of age, religious or marital status. Vaginal stenosis for example, should be documented regularly as part of tumour surveillance, however this is frequently poorly recorded and inconsistently graded. Therefore, the other physical components of sexual dysfunction arising from pelvic radiotherapy, are probably also under-reported.</P>
<P>The principles of treatment vary according to the different phases of the development of toxicity: </P>

<BR/>Both patients and partners should be made aware of the potential consequences of treatment during initial consultations prior to therapy with reinforcement thereafter. Baseline sexual function should be documented for comparisons to be made subsequently. There is considerable current emphasis on education and prevention of potential sexual dysfunction, but both prophylaxis and management of established problems need to be standardised. Measuring outcome is difficult and brings us back to the nature of the presenting problem and the impact that sexual problems have on quality of life (QOL), regardless of age or marital status (<LINK REF="REF-Cull-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cull 1993</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal dilators</HEADING>
<P>As part of the treatment for endometrial and cervical cancer, patients are likely to receive external beam radiation and/or intracavitary irradiation either as the primary treatment or in conjunction with surgery. The assessment of patients following intracavitary treatment may reveal vaginal stenosis although this is generally poorly recorded. The response of the vaginal epithelium to radiation is immediate and persists for three to six months. Although re-epithelisation occurs, normal structure and appearance may never return. One study suggests that up to 80% of women have some degree of vaginal stenosis following therapeutic irradiation (<LINK REF="REF-Abitol-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abitol 1974</LINK>) and that stricture of the upper third of the vagina is more commonly seen. In most cases the maximum stenosis occurs within a three to six month period. Complete vaginal occlusion occurs infrequently. The stenosis occurs as a result of the formation of adhesions, together with the circumferential fibrosis of upper vaginal tissue. This leads to contraction of the vaginal vault and a shortened vagina. Subsequently difficulties may arise for the clinician at follow up with limited access for tumour surveillance because of the narrowed aperture of the vagina. More importantly stenosis may cause physical problems with sexual intercourse producing dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and postcoital bleeding. As a means of preventing this and treating established stenosis clinicians may recommend the use of dilators or sexual intercourse with lubrication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Oestrogens</HEADING>
<P>As a direct and immediate response to radiation to the vagina, there is loss of virtually all epithelium in the areas receiving the maximal surface radiation and this loss persists through the first three to six months after radiation. Following this period there is early epithelial replacement consisting of a thin and incomplete layer of basal cells. The epithelial covering becomes progressively more complete and by two years the epithelium assumes a nearly normal structure. Inflammatory changes gradually diminish in a manner reciprocal to the epithelial changes. The use of topical oestrogen following completion of radiation therapy is thought to have a significant effect upon the promotion of epithelial regeneration, and may be even more pronounced when topical oestrogen is given to patients who are three months or longer post radiation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Benzydamine</HEADING>
<P>This compound belongs to the group of anti-inflammatories which act directly on inflammation by stabilising cells and lysosomal membranes and by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. Benzydamine is used topically and is well absorbed through the skin reaching higher concentrations in the underlying inflamed tissue than after oral administration. In addition it has analgesic, local anaesthetic and antimicrobial effects. The anti-inflammatory properties of this agent have already been documented in other areas predominantly as an oral antiseptic mouthwash for head and neck radiation reactions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO)</HEADING>
<P>The repair of radionecrotic areas is limited by the reduced blood supply and conservative therapy is often all that is recommended. The limited vascularity is the precise reason why conservative therapy frequently fails to result in complete healing. HBO acts to stimulate collagen formation at the wound edges through elevation of local tissue oxygen tensions. New microvasculature dependent on a collagen matrix for physical support is greatly enhanced in this setting and allows re-epithelisation to occur. A course of HBO provides a rich capillary bed in surrounding radiation damaged tissue that although hypoperfused and hypoxic are still viable. This angiogenic effect fails to occur when oxygen is administered under normal pressures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal reconstruction</HEADING>
<P>Sexual response is a complex issue, and many variables interact. As anatomical restoration of the vagina is a prerequisite for intercourse, severe distortion or obliteration of the vagina following therapy for pelvic malignancy not only limits the access to regular tumour surveillance but can be psychologically devastating and repair or surgical correction may be the only option available. Of note is the fact that surgery in the irradiated field is often complicated by poor and delayed wound healing, but in those women who are keen to resume sexual activity, the benefits of reconstruction may be outweighed by the potential risks.<BR/>Reconstructive surgery after severe radiation damage or necrosis may serve two functions, firstly to repair a perineal defect and limit further tissue damage and secondly to reconstruct a vagina that may have been completely obliterated. Significant stenosis and even complete obliteration of a normal vagina can occur following pelvic radiotherapy. Stenosis can also occur following vaginal repairs. While it is relatively straightforward to create an adequate cavity between the rectum and the bladder for vaginal agenesis, restoration of the vaginal form and function in the irradiated field can be very different.</P>

<P>A data extraction form was specifically designed for the review. The following data items were extracted independently, masked with respect to journal publication, authorship and place where research was carried out. The object of this is to critically assess:<BR/>1. Trial quality characteristics<BR/>2. Participants: number of subjects at baseline, gender, mean age, type of malignancy and grade of radiation toxicity.<BR/>3. Interventions: which category of agent was used, method of administration and dose<BR/>4. Outcome data<BR/>5. Potential confounding factors: any assessment of previous treatment</P>
<P>The evaluation of methodological quality of the trials included was as described in the Cochrane Handbook. Each trial was rated according to the quality of allocation and concealment categories.<BR/>Category A: adequate concealment<BR/>Category B: uncertain, indication of adequacy<BR/>Category C: inadequate concealment<BR/>Category D: not used</P>
<P>Differences in data extraction were resolved by referring back to the original article and discussion between the two reviewers. Where necessary, information was sought from the authors of the primary study for clarification of the missing information.</P>
<P>Dichotomous data i.e. where present was expressed as the odds ratio (OR) and a common odds ratio calculated. Uncertainty in each treatment was expressed using confidence intervals (CIs).<BR/>Continuous data i.e. symptom scores were converted to the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and an overall weighted mean difference calculated with standard errors (SEs).</P>
<P>Data from different studies were only pooled when the outcome measures were the same. The Cochrane Review Manager software RevMan was used for estimation of overall treatment effects/meta-analysis of results. Both fixed and random effects models were used to calculate a weighted average of the treatment effects across the studies under review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal Dilators</HEADING>
<P>Using the search strategy stated, there were only two references that addressed the use of vaginal dilators. <LINK REF="STD-Poma-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Poma 1980</LINK> is a retrospective case series, level IIIC evidence. <LINK REF="STD-Decruze-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Decruze 1999</LINK> is a retrospective study with historical controls, level IIC evidence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Poma-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Poma 1980</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Post irradiation vaginal occlusion: nonoperative management.</P>
<P>This is a retrospective series of five cases with established complete vaginal stenosis. All patients received radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix a minimum of three years earlier and subsequently presented with complete vaginal occlusion. The common feature in the sexual background of these five cases was that they had reduced sexual activity before their cancer was diagnosed and believed that menopause and their disease was associated with a natural cessation of sexual relations.</P>
<P>The intervention used was applied digital pressure to the introitus twice a day with the application of Premarin vaginal cream 2g dose, for a period of six to eight weeks. They were instructed to stop pressure or dilatation when and if pain and bleeding ensued. The response to treatment was assessed by vaginal measurements at the start, and then at four and six to eight weeks after treatment.</P>
<P>All cases had a marked progressive improvement at both four and six to eight weeks and a minimum dimension of ten cm (length) by three cm (width). Sexual intercourse started in all cases by the sixth week. Cytological smears improved in three of the cases during the oestrogenic treatment but this vanished after the cream ceased. All cases were monitored for one year and the functional capacity was maintained.<BR/>No side effects were reported. Statistical analysis was not performed. Although quality of life impact has not been assessed, there is a statement about the diminished self-image all had before treatment and the definite improvement in their self-esteem and self-confidence following treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Decruze-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Decruze 1999</LINK>, level IIB<BR/>Prevention of vaginal stenosis in patients following vaginal brachytherapy.<BR/>This is a retrospective series with a concurrent historical control group for comparison to assess whether sexual intercourse or the use of a vaginal stent could prevent the development of vaginal stenosis. The authors examined the records of seventy women who received intracavitary brachytherapy, either with or without external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of cervical or uterine cancer. Thirty-five were treated during the period of 1991 to 1994 when the advice after completion of radiotherapy was to resume regular sexual intercourse to maintain vaginal patency. The other thirty-five were treated after this period when a new vaginal stent had been introduced and patients were fitted with the appropriate size of stent after completion of radiotherapy, and instructed on its use, daily for one year even if they were sexually active. All cases were assessed at six weeks for tumour response and then three monthly thereafter and at one year to determine clinically whether the vaginal dimensions were the same as at the time of intracavitary treatment. Any reduction was deemed to be evidence of stenosis. The baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Of those who had not used a stent, 20 out of 35 (54%) had evidence of stenosis at follow up. Of those that had used a stent, four out of 35 (11%) had evidence of stenosis. The four who were found to have vaginal stenosis were noted to be using the stent incorrectly and on rectification were noted to have improvement of their stenosis. Although most of the cases had used the stent to prevent the development of vaginal stenosis, the four in whom it was not prevented, had a therapeutic effect in the established stenosed vagina. Side effects were not reported. Statistical analysis was not performed on this data in the reference and there was no QOL assessment.</P>
<P>Both studies demonstrated a significant benefit maintained for the follow up period of one year, although the retrospective case series suffers from selection bias, and is weaker evidence than the effect shown by <LINK REF="STD-Decruze-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Decruze 1999</LINK>. Side effects were not noted in either of the studies, nor was there any mention of mortality, or a formal quality of life assessment.</P>
<P>Even though <LINK REF="STD-Decruze-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Decruze 1999</LINK> is not a randomized study, it has been included in the review and the statistical analysis is presented in the results section.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1965</LINK>, is a prospective series with an active treatment group and concurrent placebo group, level IIA. Here the intervention was used in the treatment of acute and late toxicity.<BR/>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1965</LINK>, level IIA<BR/>The effect of topical oestrogen on the irradiated vaginal epithelium.<BR/>This is a prospective series with an active treatment group and a placebo group although there are no details about randomization or concealment allocation. Forty-nine cases had been treated with radiation for carcinoma of the cervix three months ago. The subjects selected include only those who were under 50, had intercourse at least monthly and had no evidence of residual disease. The baseline assessment included a vaginal smear and punch biopsy. The gross appearance of the cervix and upper vagina was noted and cases were questioned about their vaginal bleeding, discharge and dyspareunia.</P>
<P>Each case was given a supply of 0.01% dienestrol or identical cream base containing no oestrogenic substance and instructed to insert one applicator full intravaginally three times weekly for one month. The method of randomisation is not stated and whether the clinician was blinded is not clear. Three months later smears and biopsies were repeated and the same information recorded.</P>
<P>In order to facilitate comparison a classification for smears and biopsies was developed, based on the maturation of the vaginal epithelium of the 49 cases over a period of three months to three years following radiotherapy (RT).</P>
<P>Thirty-one cases (from different time periods after radiation) treated with oestrogen had an average histological grade of 3.33 after treatment (versus 1.57 from smears and biopsies at the same time interval who were untreated). This effect was greater in those who had received oestrogen cream more than three months after RT.</P>
<P>Sixteen out of 31 complained of discharge or bleeding prior to oestrogen therapy and 13 reported improvement or disappearance of the symptoms. Twelve out of 31 complained of dyspareunia and 10 out of 31 reported various degrees of relief following the use of topical oestrogen.</P>
<P>Seven cases were treated with placebo-the average histological grade was essentially the same as those taken at the same time interval post radiation prior to any treatment.</P>
<P>The author's conclusion was that the application of a topical oestrogen was found to accelerate the regeneration of the epithelium and that this was more pronounced in the cases who had intervals of greater than three months after RT. The duration of follow up was three months and no side effects were reported. There was no statistical analysis of data and no quality of life assessment.</P>
<P>As this was a controlled study, although the issue of randomization was unclear, our intention was to include the results in the MetaView program. However for the following reasons the data is not in a suitable format to be used:</P>
<P>1. The mean change in score of the epithelium before and after the treatment means that one cannot dichotomise the results and similarly for the placebo group where there was no mean change quoted. Neither can this information be used as continuous data as there is no standard error or deviation available.<BR/>2. Thirteen out of 16 reported improvement from discharge or bleeding as a result of topical oestrogens but were not matched by a comparative value in the placebo group.<BR/>3. Ten out of 12 reported improvement from dyspareunia as a result of topical oestrogens but were not matched by a comparative value in the placebo group.<BR/>Although we have tried to contact the authors for more information we have not had a response which we assume is because this was published in 1965.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1971</LINK>, level IC<BR/>Post irradiation vaginitis. An evaluation of prophylaxis with topical oestrogen.<BR/>This is a controlled double-blinded study although the method of randomization is not stated. Ninety-three women received primary radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. Exclusion criteria removed patients with obvious residual tumour, and those who had received systemic oestrogen. Each subject was interviewed on completion of radiotherapy and received a supply of vaginal cream which either did or did not contain 0.01% dienestrol, one applicator full to be inserted into the vagina at night, three times a week till the cream was exhausted (mean six to nine months). Both active and placebo agents were supplied by the manufacturer in identical packaging, identified by a code number which was kept by the manufacturer till the study was complete. The response was assessed by the degree of bleeding, intercourse with dyspareunia, vaginal calibre and vaginal epithelium in both groups. At the end of the treatment the code was broken and 44 used the oestrogen cream while 49 received the placebo. The baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable.</P>
<P>Results table<BR/>Bleeding Oestrogen Placebo<BR/>Total 44 49<BR/>No PV bleed 35 32<BR/>Contact bleed 9 13<BR/>Spontaneous bleeding 0 4<BR/>The differences in the incidence and severity of bleeding was not significant (p&gt;0.05) using the Chi squared test. The odds ratio of bleeding occurring, regardless of intensity in the treatment group was 0.48 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.24).</P>

<P>The vaginal calibre was normal twice as often in the oestrogen treated group (p&gt;0.01) using the Chi squared test. The vaginal epithelium was normal four times as often in the oestrogen treated group (p&gt;0.05) using the Chi squared test.</P>
<P>The patients having intercourse were significantly younger and had generally less marked degrees of vaginal constriction than non-coital patients but the incidence of bleeding and epithelium did not differ significantly between the two groups.</P>
<P>Side effects were not reported. There was no quality of life assessment. In summary the oestrogen treated patients in comparison with the controls had significantly less dyspareunia, alterations in the vaginal epithelium and vaginal narrowing. Coitus independently was also associated with a normal vaginal calibre.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hintz-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hintz 1981</LINK>, level IIC<BR/>Systemic absorption of conjugated oestrogenic cream by the irradiated vagina.<BR/>This is a prospective observational study with a non randomized control group. The treatment group consisted of six postmenopausal women treated with radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix a minimum of one year ago. The control group consisted of three women who were also postmenopausal and had received radiotherapy to non pelvic areas. Neither study nor control patients had used oestrogen in any form for at least three months prior to the study. All cases received Premarin vaginal cream containing 1.25 mg of conjugated oestrogens per 2g of cream to be used nightly for two weeks.</P>
<P>Baseline assessment was with a subjective assessment of vaginal dryness and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutenising hormone (LH) and oestrodiol levels. These were repeated four hours after the first application of vaginal cream. The vaginal mucosa was then reassessed three weeks later with an evaluation of the clinical status and side effects to determine the response. At follow up the appearance of the vaginal mucosa after two weeks of nightly Premarin was subjectively scored as improved in four out of six treatment and two out of three control patients.</P>
<P>An independent OR was conducted which demonstrated a value of one (95% CI 0.05 to 18.92) for the effect of topical oestrogen on the irradiated and non-irradiated postmenopausal vaginal mucosa. For both groups the FSH was unchanged from the baseline whereas at four hours the LH decreased significantly (p&lt;0.01) using the Student's t test. This indicates the in vivo biological effect of the plasma oestrogens. The oestrodiol levels increased significantly from the baseline values (p&lt;0.01). For the control group exactly the same differences were seen and there were no significant differences when comparing the mean differences between groups. Side effects were not noted and there was no QOL assessment. Hence it appears that the irradiated cervix absorbs oestrogenic vaginal cream comparably to non-irradiated controls, however if systemic oestrogen is contraindicated this route does not provide safety.</P>

<P>Summary of research evidence</P>
<P>Level IIA, <LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1965</LINK>, topical oestrogens were used in acute and late toxicity. The epithelial response to topical oestrogens was assessed and the data provided as a change in the mean score and similarly so for the placebo group so that the results could not be dichotomised and used. This could not be used as continuous data either as there was no documentation of the standard error or the standard deviation of the samples. Although there were reductions in the numbers of cases with dyspareunia and bleeding after the use of oestrogens there was no comparable data for the control group. The impression is that the effect of oestrogens is beneficial but there is no follow up period for duration.</P>
<P>Level IC, <LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1971</LINK>, was used in the treatment of acute toxicity. The method of allocation concealment was not clearly stated. The odds ratio for the effects of oestrogens on bleeding was not significant. The odds ratio of dyspareunia occurring in the treatment group was 0.26 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.84) or 3.81 (95% CI 1.19 to 12.16) in the placebo group. The vaginal calibre was normal twice as often in the oestrogen treated group (p&lt;0.01) using the Chi squared test. The vaginal epithelium was normal four times as often in the oestrogen treated group (p&lt;0.05) using the Chi squared test. The details for abnormal calibre and epithelium are not stated and cannot be assumed. Here there was good evidence for the benefit of oestrogens but no duration of response.</P>
<P>Level IIC, <LINK REF="STD-Hintz-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hintz 1981</LINK> again showed a benefit for the use of topical oestrogens in late toxicity, both in the irradiated and postmenopausal mucosa but the period of follow up and response was short at three weeks.</P>
<P>Level IIIC, <LINK REF="STD-Poma-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Poma 1980</LINK>, showed no significant difference in the improvement in all cases in the treatment of late toxicity and the duration of response was one year.</P>
<P>All these studies showed outcome improvements with the use of vaginal oestrogen applications in both acute and late toxicity but without the duration of response. <LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1971</LINK>is the only study in this section where the data is suitable for inclusion in the systematic review for statistical analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">A. Controlled clinical trial</HEADING>
<P>A double blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 30 patients, who had recently completed brachytherapy with or without external beam radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix or uterus and developed acute vaginitis. The method of randomization was not stated and nor was the blinding of the patients or clinicians. All the cases had developed acute vaginal symptoms during the course of their radiation therapy. The symptoms and signs of pain, pruritis, tension, burning sensation, vaginal tenderness and oedema were rated on a three point scale (0=absent and 2=severe) pre and post treatment as was the clinical impression which was graded as excellent, good, fair, slight and nil. There were three equally divided groups of 10, treated with 0.1% benzydamine vaginal douche, 0.1% benzydamine alone (i.e. no preservative) and with placebo. Douching with the products under study was carried out twice daily for 15 days beginning 24 hours after completion of radiotherapy. The response was scored at days five and fifteen. After 15 days of treatment a significant reduction in the total score occurred in all three groups. But the mean decrease in the total score with the placebo (38.8%) was lower than with either benzydamine plus preservative (87%) or benzydamine alone (90.7%). The covariance analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two preparations of benzydamine but both were significantly superior to placebo. At the end of the 15th day of treatment, excellent or good overall improvement occurred in 17 out of 20 of the treatment group and in four out of 10 in the placebo group. Side effects were noted in three of the cases treated with benzydamine and the dosage was halved due to local irritation. There was no quality of life assessment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">B. Prospective case series for post radiotherapy acute vaginitis</HEADING>
<P>An uncontrolled trial was carried out on 30 cases following brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix or uterine body. Vaginal douches of 0.1% benzydamine, were used twice daily for 15 days beginning 24 hours after completion of radiation therapy. The severity of the symptoms was assessed at the start and at days five and fifteen of treatment using the score previously described. The clinical overall impression was also judged at the end of treatment. Benzydamine vaginal douches produced a highly significant (p&lt;0.001) average overall improvement i.e. reduction of score and improvement in all symptoms and signs after both five and fifteen days of treatment. After 15 days the mean total score had decreased by 84.8% for symptoms and signs. There was without exception an improvement in each symptom and sign after both five and fifteen days of treatment. Overall improvement occurred in all 30 patients treated with the trial period-26 good or excellent and four were slight. Side effects were noted in four of the cases treated with Benzydamine and the dosage was halved due to irritation. There was no quality of life assessment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Volteranni-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Volteranni 1987</LINK>, level IC<BR/>Topical Benzydamine in the treatment of vaginal radiomucositis<BR/>This is a double blind randomized clinical trial although there are no details of the methods of the allocation concealment or blinding but reference to the assessors being blinded. Although not stated the implication is that both patients and clinicians were blinded. Thirty-two patients were treated, 16 with benzydamine and 16 with placebo. All were women who were had recently received brachytherapy for the treatment of gynaecological malignancy and had already developed acute vaginal mucositis as a result of the preceding external beam radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy. The treatment was with preparations of either benzydamine or placebo prepared by the pharmacy and coded with instructions to use twice daily for 14 days as a vaginal douche. The baseline symptoms were assessed by a mean score of the subjective assessment of the presenting symptoms and also the mean score of the objective assessment from the colposcopic appearance pre and post intervention. Baseline characteristics and scores were higher in the benzydamine group as twice as many cases were receiving brachytherapy after external beam radiotherapy. The response was assessed on the changes in the subjective and objective scores in both groups.<BR/>The benzydamine group had a statistically significant fall in the total score by 25.5% (p&lt;0.05) and the placebo group had a statistically significant rise in the score by 72% (p&lt;0.001) (both Student's t test). The clinical opinion was good or excellent in nine out of 16 of the treatment group, and 15 out of 16 of the placebo group did not derive any therapeutic benefit. This was determined on colposcopic appearance by submission to three independent assessors who were blinded to the treatment. Side effects were not noted and there was no quality of life assessment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kanaev-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kanaev 1998</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>The use of Tantum Rosa in the prevention of the treatment of radiation-induced vaginitis and proctitis<BR/>This was a retrospective study. Twenty patients with acute radiation induced vaginitis (RT for carcinoma of the vagina in six cases and carcinoma of the uterus in fourteen cases) were characterised by hyperaemia of the mucous membrane, monolayer and necrotic epithelium. Eighteen sustained their injuries within the first six months of receiving radiotherapy and two after this period. The intervention was Tantum Rosa powder 9.4g diluted in 500 ml of water. A tampon was soaked in this solution and applied for 15 to 30 minutes twice daily for two weeks. Treatment response was assessed on the degree of resolution of objective change in the mucosa after treatment. In 15 out of 20 cases the radiation induced injury in the vagina disappeared a week after initiation of the treatment . A check one to two months after completion of treatment with Tantum Rosa showed that in all the cases that had been observed to improve and the mucous membrane had a normal appearance. In cases where this preparation was not used, persistent mucositis was noted with progressive stenosis of the vagina. It is not clear from the results whether the responders were in the acute or late group.</P>
<P>There is no statistical analysis, no quality of life assessment and although side effects were looked for there were none. Although there were two cases of late radiation vaginal mucositis this report essentially refers to treatment effects on acute symptoms.</P>

The intervention was Tantum Rosa vaginal douche twice daily for 10 to 14 days. Twenty-four of the 30 cases responded to treatment with a substantial drop in the leucocyte fraction of the vaginal mucosa. Side effects were not reported.

All were in English and all were uncontrolled case series, with one prospective observational study (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1992</LINK>) and the remainder being retrospective.

All 12 were female and had received pelvic radiotherapy a minimum of one year previously, for carcinoma of the cervix in 10 cases, urethral cancer and Hodgkin's Disease in the final case. The radiation injuries were in the vaginal vault in eight cases, in the perineum in two cases and vesicovaginal fistula in the remaining two. In all cases, malignant disease had been excluded by investigations and biopsy and all had failed to respond to conservative measures such as debridement, cleansing and antibiotics.</P>
<P>The treatment used was HBO in a monoplace chamber at two and a half to three atmospheres of pressure of 100% oxygen for 40 to 60 minutes a day, four to five times a week. The average number of treatments was 23 (range five to 53). The response to treatment was assessed by the resolution of the wounds after treatment with HBO.</P>
<P>Of the 12 with vault or perineal necrosis, eight showed marked or complete healing of their wounds. Three developed recurrent tumour having been clear of recurrence at the start of HBO and one developed a rectovaginal fistula after five treatments requiring a colostomy and HBO was not then reinstated. The duration of follow up is not stated so the duration of the response is not clear. The only side effect noted was of one case of a tympanic membrane rupture which healed without problems.

All 12 had received radical radiotherapy for gynaecological malignancies (seven were vulva, three were vaginal and two were endometrial), a mean period of 16.2 months previously (range three to 69 months). Seven had chronic medical conditions that may have compromised the blood supply in the irradiated area. Seven presented with areas of necrosis in the vulva and five in the vagina. All had failed to respond to conservative measures with surgical debridement, antibiotics and intensive local applications and only one with a particularly large necrotic ulcer was treated with HBO.<BR/>The details of HBO are not given. This therapy failed to produce a response and did not produce even partial healing.

All were female and had received radiotherapy for cervical cancer in nine cases, endometrial cancer in one case, vaginal cancer in three cases and colonic cancer in one case. The interval from radiotherapy is not stated. The inclusion criteria allowed women who were free of active malignancy and had failure of healing for a minimum period of three months despite conservative therapy with antiseptic irrigation, debridement and topical agents.</P>
<P>Eleven had soft tissue necrosis of the vaginal vault and two had vaginal necrosis with an associated rectovaginal fistula. The final case had massive necrosis of the abdominal wall, sacrum and vagina with rectovaginal and vesicovaginal fistulae.</P>
<P>The intervention used was a monoplace hyperbaric chamber compressed to two atmospheres of pressure for 90 to 120 minute sessions once or twice a day with 44 treatments on average (range 18 to 143). The response to treatment was assessed on the degree of resolution of the radionecrotic area. All of the 11 with just vault necrosis had shown marked improvement or resolution within eight weeks of completing therapy (one of the 11 developed recurrent tumour which healed well after exenteration and has remained well at nine months). Both the cases with fistulae underwent defunctioning colostomies followed by hyperbaric oxygen therapy with resolution of necrosis-without relapse at three years.</P>
<P>Treatment failure occurred in the case with massive necrosis who progressed and died in spite of active therapy.</P>
<P>A ruptured tympanum occurred in one case healing spontaneously. No statistical analysis quality of life data was available.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Feldmeier--1996" TYPE="STUDY">Feldmeier 1996</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Hyperbaric oxygen an adjunctive treatment for delayed radiation injuries of the abdomen and pelvis<BR/>This is a retrospective series of 12 women who had sustained radionecrotic injuries to the perineum (seven) and vagina (five). The median time of interval of referral for hyperbaric oxygen therapy after completion of radiation therapy was 18 months. All had received pelvic radiotherapy for the following malignancies: carcinoma of the vulva in two cases, cervix in five, anus in two, rectosigmoid junction in one and bladder in one. The dimensions of the ulcer or baseline appearance were available in all cases. All had failed to respond to conservative therapies. All the cases in this series were graded according to the RTOG grading system and all were grade IV.</P>
<P>The intervention used was hyperbaric oxygen therapy 90 minute treatments, six days/week, at 2.4 atmospheres of pressure in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber with a minimum course of 20 treatments and a median number of 46 in those that healed. The response to treatment was assessed on the degree of resolution of the radionecrotic area. In the perineal sites three healed (one with surgery and the other two without surgery) and four failed. Of these four, one died of a CVA and the other three failed to heal because of residual tumour). All five of the vaginal lesions responded well with resolution of the ulcerated areas. Therefore the response rate was eight out of 12. The duration of the response is not stated. There was no statistical analysis and no quality of life data. Side effects were not noted.</P>
<P>The four case series all address the issue of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for established late toxicity that had failed to respond to all other conservative measures. Although benefit is suggested all these reports suffer from a lack of a control group and selection and publication bias. There are occasional reports of side effects related to this intervention and in the total 39 cases there were two reports of aural barotrauma which were self-limiting and healed spontaneously. Although deaths occurred in these series none were treatment related but rather a consequence of the progressive disease process.</P>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of radiation related necrosis in the pelvis has a sound theoretical basis and the preliminary results in these reports are largely convincing. However these results are essentially based on weak evidence from small retrospective series hampered by selection and publication bias. It is unlikely that randomized studies will ever be conducted in this setting because of the rarity of the condition and the few facilities offering this intervention. However what is feasible is that those cases that are treated in this setting are entered into a central database with formal pre and post treatment standardised assessments that can be analysed against matched concurrent controls to assess the true benefit of this potentially valuable therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal reconstruction</HEADING>
<P>Using the search strategy stated 10 reports were identified which were potentially relevant. All were retrospective case series and uncontrolled, but addressed the issue of surgical reconstruction of the perineum or vagina following established radiation damage. These studies are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Berek-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Berek 1983</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Delayed vaginal reconstruction in the fibrotic pelvis following radiation or previous reconstruction<BR/>This is a retrospective series of 12 cases. All developed a fibrotic pelvis with distortion of the vagina as a result of pelvic radiotherapy a minimum of four years earlier. The primary tumours irradiated were cervical cancer in seven cases, vaginal cancer in four cases and endometrial cancer in one case. Nine of the 12 had undergone primary surgery before radiotherapy. The indication for surgery in all cases was vaginal stenosis.<BR/>Split thickness skin grafts were used in all cases during the process of vaginal reconstruction, placed over a stent and inserted into the newly created vaginal pocket after excision of the scar tissue. The response to treatment was assessed on the subjective degree of intercourse after treatment. The response was classed as: Good, if intercourse was with suitable penetration and was pain-free; satisfactory if the patient reported that she could have intercourse without pain but the calibre of the vagina was smaller than previously; and poor if it was not at all satisfactory. All of the procedures succeeded and all achieved at least a satisfactory result with a minimum graft take of 80%. Vaginal function was good in 11 cases and satisfactory in one case and this response was maintained for a minimum of one year. One of the good responders developed a tumour recurrence with fistulation within the next six months and remained sexually active dying within a year. Three others relapsed and died within one to nine years of treatment. There was no statistical analysis, no report of side effects and no quality of life assessment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1991</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Management of radionecrosis of the vulva and distal vagina<BR/>This is a retrospective series of twelve cases. All the women had received radical radiotherapy for the following gynaecological malignancies: seven were vulva, three were vaginal and two were endometrial, a mean period of 16.2 months ago (range three to 69 months). Seven had chronic medical conditions that may have compromised the blood supply in the irradiated area. Seven presented with areas of necrosis in the vulva and five in the vagina. All had failed to respond to conservative measures with surgical debridement, antibiotics and intensive local applications and only one with a particularly large necrotic ulcer was treated with HBO. Conservative therapy failed to respond and did not produce even partial healing in any of the cases.</P>
<P>Ten were treated with radical excision of the radionecrotic site and two were not fit for surgery. Six out of 10 underwent radical excision of the radionecrotic site without removal of the pelvic viscera (one requiring a colostomy because of the proximity of the ulcer to the anus and the anal sphincter-this was later closed). Four out of 10 required pelvic exenteration. Tissue coverage was with flaps in seven cases and primary closure in three. Three out of the 10 had recurrent tumour in their specimens although this was not clinically expected.</P>
<P>Eight out of the 10 patients healed but of these two developed flap necrosis with introital necrosis (one was surgically corrected). Three out of eight were sexually active.</P>
<P>Seven out of 10 treated surgically are alive without disease, two died of disease progression and one died without evidence of disease. Of the two not fit enough for surgery one died from a recurrence within the ulcer and the other patient is alive but the radiation ulcer is unchanged.</P>
<P>The mean time from radionecrosis to surgery was eight and a half months (range two to 20) due to the wait for conservative therapy to have an effect. Recurrent problems have not occurred in any patient who healed after surgery. There are no reports of side effects or quality of life data</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Morley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 1991</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Full thickness graft vaginoplasty for the treatment of the stenotic or fore-shortened vagina.<BR/>This is a retrospective series, in which is included an isolated case of radiation induced vaginal stenosis that underwent surgical correction. The case in question underwent radiotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma although the interval from completion of radiotherapy is not stated.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment of vaginal stenosis and apical foreshortening was evaluated at surgery and then this area was incised to create an adequate space for the full thickness skin graft taken from the flank overlying the iliac crest. The graft was then sutured in place and packed so that the graft was firmly applied to the recipient site. The packing was then removed on the sixth postoperative day and replaced by an obturator used continuously initially and then 12 hours a day for the next three to four months. Patients could participate in intercourse by the sixth week.</P>
<P>The response was assessed by the take of the graft, restoration of vaginal capacity and the resumption of sexual function. The case in question had at least 80% take, normal vaginal depth and calibre and full functional satisfaction. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported and the response was maintained for the median follow up of 25 months.</P>
<P>No statistics or quality of life data was available.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1999</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Vaginal reconstruction in the fibrotic pelvis<BR/>This is a retrospective series of six women who developed pelvic fibrosis as a result of radiotherapy with additional surgery and who subsequently underwent vaginal reconstruction over a 10 year period. All had severe vaginal stenosis and none were able to have vaginal intercourse. In all six, the proximal half of the vagina was completely obliterated and the length of the vagina ranged for two to four cm with a calibre of one to two cm. Five of the cases had split thickness skin grafts and one received an amnion graft.</P>
<P>Surgery involved the following steps:<BR/>i. Resection of the scarred vagina and creation of an adequate space between the bladder and rectum.<BR/>ii. Harvesting of a split thickness skin graft from the inner thigh or buttocks, or collection of an amnion graft.<BR/>iii. Fashioning the graft into a hollow cylinder over a mould<BR/>iv. Placement of the graft and mould into the newly created pelvic space with the cut surface facing outwards.<BR/>Postoperatively the mould was removed on day five and the patient was issued with a perspex oburator of adequate size and instructed to lubricate it with dienoestrol cream and insert it into the neovagina three times per day for 10 to 15 minutes continuing for six months.</P>
<P>The response to treatment was assessed in terms of both vaginal calibre, length and the ability to have satisfactory intercourse. The mean follow up period was four years and four out of the six achieved 90 % graft take normal patency with good sexual function. The remaining two had unsuccessful grafts and restenosed with failure to resume sexual activity. At completion of follow up four were alive and two were dead, (one with disease and the other without), both at four years after reconstruction. No side effects were noted, there was no quality of life assessment and no statistical analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Woods-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1992</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Experience with vaginal reconstruction utilizing the modified Singapore flap.<BR/>This is a retrospective series of seven women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy and surgery leaving them with perineal defects requiring vaginal reconstruction. All seven had received preoperative and intraoperative RT and at the time of pelvic exenteration a posterior perineal defect was left which was repaired with vaginal reconstruction synchronously.</P>
<P>The technique used was with a modified Singapore flap which are raised fasciocutaneous flaps, bilaterally in the groin crease just lateral to the labia and include the deep fascia. The base of the flaps are undermined at the subcutaneous level and tunneled under the labia. To avoid any possible compromise of the flaps the labia are divided posteriorly and the flaps inset with the apex of the neovagina sutured to the sacrum or the adjacent structures to avoid prolapse.</P>
<P>While there were numerous complications postoperatively none were related to flap failure. Despite urine leakage, fistulae, abscess formation and dehiscence there was no flap necrosis at any time. All surgical complications were related to the extent of the surgery compounded by poor healing in an irradiated field. Only two of this series have resumed intercourse as the rest were undergoing adjuvant therapy or were generally unwell postoperatively. Mechanical problems were not the disabling factor. There was no quality of life assessment or statistical data.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Skene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Skene 1990</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Perineal, vulval and vaginoperineal reconstruction using the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap.<BR/>This is a retrospective case series of five people who had all developed perineal radionecrosis following radiotherapy for carcinoma of the anus. One of these had also developed a recurrence in the anus and rectovaginal septum. In all five cases the rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap was used to reconstruct the vagina and perineum. All had previously undergone a defunctioning colostomy for persistent sphincter damage after radiation. All underwent total pelvic exenteration with urinary diversion and vaginal reconstruction. A loop of colon or ileum (pedicled) was used for the vagina and the flap was used to recreate vulva and perineum. The donor site for the flap closed with primary closure in all cases as did the perineal wounds. All cases with urinary diversions were continent and practised self intermittent catheterisation successfully. One patient had a perineal recurrence which was successfully excised at 16 months with good healing maintained at six months. Sexual function was not assessed and there was no quality of life or statistical data. No side effects were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Germann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Germann 1998</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>The partial gluteus maximus musculocutaneous turnover flap. An alternative concept for simultaneous reconstruction of combined defects of the posterior perineum/sacrum and the posterior vaginal wall.<BR/>This is a retrospective series including an isolated case report of reconstruction following surgery and radiotherapy. The case was a female who had undergone AP resection for a rectal carcinoma with pre and postoperative radiation followed by postoperative chemotherapy. Wound infections complicated the postoperative course resulting in a 10x10cm sacral perineal defect. The first flap failed and then the same procedure was attempted with a myocutaneous turnover flap as a modification of the gluteus maximus flap to address the particular reconstructive problems. The flaps neurovascular innervation was left in tact with the inferior gluteal artery and the posterior cutaneous femoral nerve. The skin islands were there to fill the perineal defect or for vaginal reconstruction.</P>
<P>This flap enabled the successful reconstruction of the posterior vaginal wall and appropriate soft tissue coverage and the donor site healed with primary closure. Postoperative healing was uneventful. The neovagina showed no shortening or healing and sexual intercourse was resumed by the patient. There was no quality of life or statistical data and no side effects were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1994</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Pudendal thigh fasciocutaneous flaps for vaginal reconstruction in gynecologic oncology.<BR/>This is a retrospective series of vaginal reconstructive surgery in seven cases who had all undergone radiotherapy for pelvic malignancy and then required pelvic exenteration. The reconstruction was performed at the time of exenteration. The malignancies treated were as follows: three cervix, two endometria, one vagina and one bladder cancer. The duration from radiotherapy or the outcome of treatment and the reason for subsequent surgery are not stated. The indication for vaginal reconstruction in all cases was the desire for continuing sexual intercourse post exenteration. The technique used was the pudendal thigh fasciocutaneous flap. The flaps were raised in the thigh creases just lateral to the hair bearing area of the labia majora and included skin, subcutaneous tissues, deep fascia of the thigh and adductor muscles. Bilateral flaps were used in all cases. The flaps were technically easy to perform in all cases. The response was assessed by patient interview and clinical assessment 19 months after surgery.</P>
<P>Partial apical flap necrosis occurred in four patients. One patient developed necrosis of both flaps followed by a enterovaginal fistula. One case who did not have flap necrosis developed a rectovaginal fistula at the site of rectal anastamosis. The functional results were disappointing. No patient has had successful coitus. Other long term sequelae involve vulvar pain in two cases, chronic vaginal discharge two, hair growth in four cases and protrusion of the flap in two cases.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Achauer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Achauer 1983</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Gluteal thigh flap in the reconstruction of complex wounds<BR/>This is a retrospective case series of reconstructive surgery in nine cases, three of whom had sustained radiation perineal wounds. The three were all females who had sustained radiation ulcers of the perineum following radiotherapy to the vagina and vulva a minimum of six months earlier. Two had developed non-healing perineal ulcerations and the third had extensive radiation necrosis of the vulvar region with a large perineal wound. Conservative therapy had failed in all cases.</P>
<P>The intervention used was a gluteal thigh flap transferred as an island although the most severe case required bilateral flaps. The response to treatment was assessed by the degree of healing, postoperative complications and whether the vagina was functioning. In one of the three cases the postoperative period was uncomplicated with primary healing and a functioning vagina (the most severe perineal wound). In one of the cases the wound margin separated requiring revision and then healed. The third case required evacuation of a haematoma postoperatively so that healing was delayed by three weeks. Flap necrosis was not stated in any of the cases. There is no long term follow up details in this series and although the two with postoperative complications healed the state of the vagina is not stated. There was no quality of life or statistical data and no side effects were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jurado-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jurado 2000</LINK>, level IIIC<BR/>Primary vaginal and pelvic floor reconstruction at the time of pelvic exenteration. A study of morbidity.<BR/>This was a retrospective series of 45 cases of pelvic exenteration for gynaecologic malignancy. Sixteen of these cases had previously received external beam radiotherapy and subsequently underwent vaginal reconstruction at the time of pelvic exenteration using the placement of a myocutaneous flap with left rectus abdominis in 11 cases, the gracilis muscle in three cases and the Singapore fasciocutaneous flap in two cases. Although 29 had no reconstructive surgery 15 of them received intraoperative radiotherapy but details of this group are not stated in this type of classification and have been excluded.</P>
<P>The graft attached successfully in 14 out of 16 cases with a partial dehiscence in two cases. Three had secondary infections and partial necrosis and five were noted to have a partial stenosis although this was significantly associated with the use of the gracilis flap (p=0.015). Among our 16 cases only four responded affirmatively about having normal intercourse.</P>
<P>With this small series and particularly with so few cases in the Singapore and gracilis groups it is impossible to draw any conclusions about which flap has the best risk-to-benefit ratio. The fasciocutaneous Singapore flap may be a good choice when the rectus abdominis flap would be too large or when there is insufficient space for passage through the levator hiatus or under the pubic arch, however this provides much less bulk for filling the pelvis. The rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap seems to be the preferable option because of its advantages over the gracilis muscle: reliability, size accessibility, less likelihood of prolapse, requiring only a single flap and closure of the donor site as a continuation of the laparotomy incision.</P>
<P>The first eight studies demonstrate differing degrees of response in terms of functional capacity, from the effect of surgical reconstruction but the duration of this response or follow up is not consistently reported. Selection and publication bias are factors which will affect the interpretation of these results. Flap necrosis, reported in seven out of 58 cases is a noted side effect although there were no reports of surgical mortality. Of note is the fact that the quality of life assessment was not conducted in any of these series which, given the nature of the outcome would have been very useful in a full evaluation of the clinical result. The 10 retrospective reports are essentially small series providing anecdotal evidence of the outcomes with split thickness skin grafts post radiation. In the absence of further controlled series no further comment can be made from these results except that subsequent reconstructive techniques should be assessed with objective comparisons using matched controls and parallel quality of life assessments which would be critical in this situation. Therefore none of these studies were included in the statistical analysis of the systematic review.</P>

<BR/>Although this data is not randomized the odds ratio (OR) of developing vaginal stenosis following use of the stent was 0.1 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.033) and relying on sexual intercourse alone the odds ratio of developing vaginal stenosis was 10.33 (95% CI 3.00 to 35.63). The response was maintained for the follow up period of one year.<BR/>

<BR/>The useable data are represented in the MetaView program. It is not feasible to assume the reciprocal numbers for abnormal calibre and abnormal epithelium as these would have been stated. Although we have written to the authors we have not had a reply presumably related to the fact this trial was published in 1971. The OR for the improvement in dyspareunia using topical oestrogens compared to the placebo is 3.81 (95% CI 1.19 to 12.16) favouring the use of vaginal oestrogen cream.</P>

<P>The two level IC studies <LINK REF="STD-Bentivoglio-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bentivoglio 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Volteranni-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Volteranni 1987</LINK> both compared the resolution of acute vaginal mucositis following treatment with benzydamine with the effect of a placebo. The primary outcome measures were the same in both studies and so the results were combined with an OR of 12.31 (95% CI 3.13 to 48.48) favouring the effects of benzydamine therapy.</P>
<P>Overall baseline assessments were conducted on all cases other than those included in the reports treated with vaginal reconstruction and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Similarly in these two sections none of the cases had their responses objectively assessed although this was performed using various scoring systems, grades or histological parameters in the majority of reports in the other sections. The dilator section has one retrospective series with a concurrent control group examining the prevention of the development of vaginal stenosis. Both the topical oestrogens section and the benzydamine have two quasi-randomized controlled studies in each section, addressing the treatment of acute vaginal mucositis. The odds ratios in each of these sections are demonstrated in the comparisons and data sections where the data can be used. All demonstrate a benefit for the treatment being investigated although different interventions cannot be directly compared. The two remaining sections on hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgical reconstruction have only case series.</P>
<P>The strongest evidence is the level IC data in the topical oestrogens (<LINK REF="STD-Pitkin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkin 1971</LINK>) and benzydamine sections (<LINK REF="STD-Bentivoglio-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bentivoglio 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volteranni-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Volteranni 1987</LINK>) for the treatment of acute radiation vaginal changes. The use of vaginal dilators to prevent the development of vaginal stenosis is supported by level IIC evidence. The value of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgical reconstruction is supported by the much weaker level IIIC evidence in the form of case series. Quality of life issues to determine the overall benefit of these interventions were not reported in any of the studies.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although we have focused on interventions for the physical aspects of sexual dysfunction produced by pelvic radiotherapy they cannot be considered in isolation but in the context of their psychological impact and associated changes in endocrine function. </P>
<P>Acute toxicity from pelvic radiotherapy is a relatively common manifestation whereas late toxicity is less frequently reported. The treatment options are limited and are often administered outside the context of a trial with neither formal baseline grading of toxicity of treatment nor appropriate assessment of response. In addition the available studies have not included either the impact of the radiation related toxicity nor the effect that the treatments for this complication have on the patient's subjective assessment in the form of quality of life scores which is paramount to the complete interpretation of the data. </P>
<P>Although there is level IC evidence (oestrogens and benzydamine) as stated previously, these studies are not recent, the allocation concealment is unclear in the text, and overall there is a variable level of assessment of the response, emphasising the need for more contemporary studies to be conducted with improved designs to clarify the investigative process and support the final result. These findings are a reflection of the quality of the data that is published regarding interventions for this aspect of the management of radiation-induced complications. </P>
<P>PPreventionof vaginal stenosis, using either graduated vaginal dilators, stents or by advocating regular sexual intercourse, is standard practice although uptake and implementation of these measures is variable. This recommendation is made regardless of sexual activity and principally to facilitate clinical assessment with a vaginal examination. Therefore, having demonstrated in Decruze's non-randomized study, the clear benefits of using a vaginal stent, a RCT would be difficult to justify on ethical grounds. Hence the evidence is sufficient to endorse the widespread recommendation for the use of vaginal dilators. </P>
<P>The evidence for the use of topical oestrogen or benzydamine in this situation is less clear due to date, quality and size of studies. In order to support their implementation these trials should be repeated with larger numbers to confirm the benefit. </P>
<P>In a climate where the acute and late toxicity of radical treatments is gaining more profile we should be in a position to offer both preventative and active treatments on the strength of high quality evidence. This will only occur if patients are rigorously entered into randomized controlled trials for the various treatment options already discussed. This could be facilitated by the development of a central database of patients with toxicities used as a source for recruitment into multicentre trials with standardised baseline and outcome assessments so that results can be pooled and assimilated for more effective clinical impact. Such a database, may be particularly useful in the rarer interventions which are limited by resources and facilities such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and reconstructive surgery. In these situations the effect of treatment should be assessed objectively and subjectively and compared with matched controls with full outcome evaluations including quality of life assessments.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The success of vaginal stents in the prevention of vaginal stenosis following pelvic radiotherapy endorses the recommendations currently being made by oncology departments, to maintain vaginal patency by some form of vaginal dilatation and supports their reinforcement. Other reported interventions, in particular the use of benzydamine douches and vaginal oestrogens, may look promising and appear to be effective in the prevention and treatment of radiation complications affecting the vagina and vulva. However one or two small studies (even if well conducted) are statistically underpowered and provide insufficient evidence. The variable nature of this spectrum of acute and late radiation complications requires large placebo controlled studies to establish whether particular treatments are effective before they can be recommended for general use in this setting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Radiation complications in the pelvis affecting the physical aspects of sexual function in women are infrequently reported by patients to the clinicians who deliver the pelvic radiotherapy, and a number of fundamental issues remain to be clarified. First, the true incidence of these complications is not clear. Therefore, physicians caring for patients who have undergone pelvic radiotherapy need to be more aware that these patients may develop problematic symptoms which may need detailed questioning to elicit and which may require specialist assessment to characterize in detail. Secondly, there is an urgent need to define clearly the diagnostic criteria and a unified grading system by which these problems may be categorised. Without such a system, it is unlikely that meaningful randomized studies can be designed for application in a multi-centre setting. To aid physicians and patients and to promote research, we propose that cases should be enrolled into regional or centralised registers of radiation toxicity or that all such patients should be referred to regional centres with an interest in radiation-induced toxicity. In this way baseline assessments may be standardised, perhaps using validated check-lists or questionnaires, therapeutic interventions may be randomized and outcome data could be pooled to assess the response to treatment objectively. This approach would provide an evidence base of results of different treatments to develop a standardised integrated care pathway for this difficult condition. </P>
