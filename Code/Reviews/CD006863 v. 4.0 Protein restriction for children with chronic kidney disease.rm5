<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-11 13:49:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality. The incidence of CKD in children less than 16 years varies between 8-13.9/million (<LINK REF="REF-Aridissino-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aridissino 2003</LINK>). The inevitable progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requires either dialysis or transplantation to sustain life. Studies in adults have shown that the control of possible disease modifiers such as arterial hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1995</LINK>), acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cowley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowley 1996</LINK>), hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphataemia (<LINK REF="REF-Barsotti-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsotti 1984</LINK>), proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Ruggenenti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruggenenti 1998</LINK>), and hyperlipidaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Keane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keane 1994</LINK>) help delay the progression to ESKD. An important issue to consider is the timing of the introduction of these interventions. <LINK REF="REF-Maschio-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maschio 1982</LINK> demonstrated that a protein and phosphate restricted, calcium and energy supplemented diet produced better results in delaying the progression of CKD in adults with mild to moderate kidney failure compared with those with more advanced kidney failure.</P>
<P>Studies in rodents have demonstrated that a high protein diet is associated with increased incidence of interstitial damage, hypertension and a high mortality rate. High protein intake leads to hyperfiltration and increase in glomerular pressure which ultimately leads to glomerular sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 1982</LINK>). Early works showed that graded reduction in dietary protein content was associated with stepwise increase in lifespan of young rats subjected to extensive renal ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Hostetter-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hostetter 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleinknecht-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinknecht 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>The response to low protein diet seems to be determined by the original renal insult or the underlying aetiology of CKD. Patients likely to respond to a low protein diet tend to be those with a reactive renal vascular bed and mild focal glomerular involvement. In these patients, reduction of hyperfiltration by a low protein diet decreases proteinuria and slows progression of CKD (<LINK REF="REF-El-Nahas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Nahas 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reduction in protein intake also leads to reduction in other metabolites that may be harmful to the kidney such as phosphates, sulphates, sodium and potassium (<LINK REF="REF-Combe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combe 1994</LINK>). In addition, a low protein diet will attenuate acidosis. Acidosis is the main reason for protein catabolism in uraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Greiber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greiber 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hara-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hara 1987</LINK>). Acidosis also prevents growth hormone induced growth in uraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinknecht-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinknecht 1996</LINK>). A recent Cochrane Review of low protein diets for CKD in non diabetic adults concluded that reducing protein intake reduces renal death by 31% as compared with higher unrestricted protein intake (<LINK REF="REF-Fouque-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouque 2006</LINK>). However, restriction of dietary protein in childhood raises concerns about impaired growth due to the increased protein requirements of growing children (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO_x002f_UNU-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO/UNU 1985</LINK>). In children restricted protein intake is associated with decreased IGF-1 levels (<LINK REF="REF-Underwood-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underwood 1999</LINK>). Growth factors like IGF-1 are necessary for normal bone growth (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The success of a protein restricted diet in children will depend on meeting the requirements for growth and close monitoring of anthropometric indices. The modification of diet in kidney disease study (MDRD study) in adults demonstrated that anthropometric indices and serum albumin and serum transferrin remained within normal limits in the low protein group versus the usual protein intake group (0.6 g/kg/d versus 1.3 g/kg/d), although there were small but significant declines in various indices including body weight and urine creatinine excretion (<LINK REF="REF-Kopple-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopple 1997</LINK>). To evaluate this further <LINK REF="REF-Kopple-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopple 2000</LINK> correlated GFR with dietary and nutritional parameters and found that protein and energy intakes, serum albumin, transferrin and total cholesterol and percentage of total body fat progressively declined as GFR decreased. There is a concern that patients, especially those with severe CKD, spontaneously reduce their dietary protein intake. This is associated with deteriorating nutritional indices and imposing additional restrictions on these patients will result in nutritional deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Ikizler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikizler 1995</LINK>). An association has also been shown between hypoalbuminaemia and increased mortality in adult haemodialysis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kaysen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaysen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowrie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowrie 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Not only the amount of protein intake but the type of protein ingested is also crucial. Healthy volunteers fed with either vegetable or animal protein diets had significantly different effects on renal plasma flow, GFR, renal vascular resistance and albumin excretion independent of daily amount of protein ingested (<LINK REF="REF-Kontessis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kontessis 1990</LINK>). Diet supplemented with essential amino acids and calcium-keto and hydroxy acids may be useful to improve linear growth and nutritional status in children with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1983</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>

<P>This review aimed to determine the efficacy of low protein diets in children for preventing the natural progression of CKD towards maintenance dialysis and transplantation, with evaluation of possible benefits and harms on maintaining growth and nutritional status.

<P>The literature search identified 62 studies. Ten were identified as reports of two RCTs, with a total of 250 patients, 124 received a protein restricted diet and 126 received a control diet.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK> (one study with stratification), a six month run-in period preceded the study. In the run-in period patients were taught to weigh their food for the four-day (which included a weekend) dietary diaries. They were also taught to estimate the energy and protein content of their food. A minimum of two dietary diaries and four creatinine clearances were done. Only those patients willing and able to regularly visit the outpatients clinic, collect 24 hour urine samples, and write dietary diaries were eligible for stratification.</P>
<P>Children (n = 226) aged 2 to 18 years were stratified by their primary kidney disease. The disease groups were 1) glomerular diseases, 2) uropathy and 3) congenital or hereditary nephropathy. In each disease group patients were stratified into progressive (<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK>) or non-progressive (<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>) based on the decrease in GFR over the run-in period. The slope of regression line of creatinine clearance over time was used to calculate progression and patients with -3 mL/min/1.73 m² or less were defined as progressive. These stratified patients were then randomised to the lowest safe protein intake recommended by WHO (0.8 to 1.1 g/kg/d) versus unrestricted protein intake. All patients were advised to have a calorie intake of at least 70% of WHO recommendations. The primary outcome was change in creatinine clearance. Other outcomes analysed were blood pressure, proteinuria and anthropometric indices (height, weight, skinfold thickness, upper arm circumference), serum albumin, serum transferrin, serum triglyceride and serum cholesterol. At two years, 191 completed follow-up and 112 patients completed three years. The mean protein intake of patients in the diet group was significantly lower than controls (125% versus 181% of WHO recommendations). Two-thirds of all patients complied with diet as measured by dietary diaries and urinary urea-nitrogen excretion.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Uauy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Uauy 1994</LINK> presented the growth and nutrition data from the feasibility phase of multicentre RCT. Twenty four infants were recruited at the age of six months or less (adjusted for prematurity). They underwent an adjustment period of two months during which all infants were fed a formula with intermediate protein:energy ratio (P:E ratio) of 8%. They were then randomly assigned at eight months of age to receive either a low protein (1.4 ± 0.3 g/kg/d, P:E ratio 5.6%) or control protein (2.4 ± 0.4 g/kg/d, P:E ratio 10.4%)<B> </B>formula for 10 months. The main outcome measure was growth. The limitation of the study was small size (n = 24). The short period of follow-up and lack of progression to ESKD meant that evaluation of patients for GFR over time could not be done.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key findings</HEADING>
<P>The results of this systematic review suggest that nutritional intervention in the form of protein restriction in children with CKD does not have significant impact on renal death. Renal death was chosen as a primary outcome because it is an easily observed outcome i.e. the date of commencement of dialysis, kidney transplant or death. Since renal death is an uncommon outcome, change in renal function over the study period in the two groups was also analysed. This data was available from only one study and did not reveal any significant difference between the protein restricted and control group over a three-year period. There is some concern about the degree of compliance to a low protein diet with self reported protein intake being 125% of WHO recommendations in the protein restricted group. Determination of protein intake by the urea nitrogen excretion method revealed an intake of 141% of WHO recommendations in the protein restricted group and 181% of WHO recommendations in the control group. This raises the question whether the protein restriction was not severe enough to protect against the haemodynamically mediated glomerular injury when there is significant reduction in functioning nephrons. This also suggests that the diet was difficult to adhere to and therefore highlights the practicalities of following this diet in the long term, without any obvious clinical benefits.</P>
<P>Another important finding was that a reduction in protein intake to safe amounts does not have significant impact on a child's growth as shown by anthropometry data from the two studies. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Uauy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Uauy 1994</LINK> however raises concerns over introducing a low protein diet to infants and demonstrated significantly lower SDS for length in this group compared with controls (-2.6 ± 1.2 versus -1.7 ± 0.9). Similarly, the length velocity SDS in the low protein group was significantly less than the control group. As the two studies are hugely different in both sample size and age this might have had an impact on the meta-analysis findings (mean age 8 months for <LINK REF="STD-Uauy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Uauy 1994</LINK>, compared to 9 to 11 years for <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK>). This also raises the question whether the younger group is more susceptible to growth restricting effects of a low protein diet. On the other hand it could be that it was much easier to impose actual protein restriction on infants receiving formula and thus they were receiving lower protein intakes than that achieved in the older group of <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Uauy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Uauy 1994</LINK> also noted a deficient energy intake of only 92% of that considered ideal for normal children of equivalent length in some patients. One third of patients received less than the minimum energy intake considered acceptable (80% of RDA for length) on one or more occasions. This is important because deficient energy intake contributes to poor protein utilisation. Deficient energy intake alone however, cannot explain the reduced length in protein restricted group of infants since this finding was also noted by <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK>. They reported a drop in mean energy intake from 92% of RDA at the start to 85% of RDA during the study in low protein group.</P>
<P>Multivariate regression analysis by <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK> revealed the degree of proteinuria and systolic blood pressure were independent predictors of decline in GFR. Low protein diets have been shown to reduce proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Levey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levey 1996</LINK>). Abnormal traffic of proteins through the glomerular capillary has intrinsic renal toxicity, possibility linked to the subsequent process of proximal tubular absorption. Protein overload has been shown to stimulates RANTES production by pig proximal tubular cells. RANTES is chemotactic agent and might promote inflammatory cell recruitment and contribute to interstitial inflammation and kidney failure progression (<LINK REF="REF-Zoza-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoza 1998</LINK>). Proteinuria also induces oxidant stress on surviving nephrons (<LINK REF="REF-Nath-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nath 1990</LINK>) and increases renin and angiotensinogen gene expression in remnant kidney models (<LINK REF="REF-Correa_x002d_Rotter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa-Rotter 1992</LINK>). However, correlation between dietary protein intake and proteinuria was not significant in <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was no significant improvement in dyslipidaemia with the protein restricted diet. None of the studies investigated quality of life (QOL) issues associated with protein restriction, an important aspect for the child and the family.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>The strength of this review is that it is first comprehensive systematic review of low protein diets in children with CKD. There have been few narrative reviews covering the topic (<LINK REF="REF-Wingen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wingen 2002</LINK>). The major limitation of the review is the very small number of identified studies, and also significant loss of follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_NP_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (NP) 1997</LINK>-<LINK REF="STD-Wingen-_x0028_P_x0029_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wingen (P) 1997</LINK> with available data on kidney function dropping from 100% to 88% at follow-up.</P>

<P>The available evidence would suggest that nutritional intervention in the form of low protein diet does not delay progression of renal failure in children with chronic kidney disease and there is uncertainty over possible harms of strictly adhered to low protein diets on growth in young infants. Observational and non-randomised studies have looked at dietary manipulation in children and its impact on renal failure progression, growth and metabolic derangement (<LINK REF="STD-Jureidini-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jureidini 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Norman 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jureidini-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jureidini 1990</LINK> has reported improvement in growth, renal osteodystrophy, dyslipidaemia and slowing down of renal failure with protein and phosphate restricted diet.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Norman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Norman 2004</LINK> further emphasise the need for number of interventions other that protein restriction which should be commenced early in chronic kidney disease and should include advise to moderate sodium, phosphate, protein and maximise energy, calcium and other micronutrients. Salt restriction has also been found to be effective in attenuating the progression of renal damage independent of its antihypertensive effects and patients ingesting high sodium intakes have worsening of proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Cianciaruso-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cianciaruso 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Factors other than diet have been shown to be reno-protective and delay ESRD. These include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, controlling hypertension and optimal glucose monitoring in diabetic patients (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soergel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soergel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>). These reno-protective strategies need to be carefully implemented in all children with CKD.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Additional well designed studies are required to investigate effectiveness of multi-faceted interventions including dietary interventions that are sub-analysed by degree of severity of renal failure, as there is work to suggest that medical and dietary interventions are most successful in early chronic kidney disease. Quality of life issues should also be addressed as the diet needs to be affordable, practical and sustainable. The results of these studies should be in conformity with CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), which would help in pooling at a later date for meta-analysis. </P>

<P>Creatinine Iothalamate study was done at 8, 14 and 18 months of age.<BR/>2 monthly anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference, triceps skin fold thickness).<BR/>Monthly clinical review including biochemistry and assessment of dietary energy intake deficiency.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Small study.<BR/>Lack of progression of renal failure so no evaluation of patients GFR over time. <BR/>The severity of decreased length tended to be worse in low protein group, whereas the weight for length and triceps skin-fold thickness tended to be lower in control group at the time of randomisation. However these differences were not statistically significant.<BR/>Serum albumin levels in control group were statistically higher, although probably not of clinical significance (4.5 versus 4.1 g/dL).<BR/>Mean energy intake only 92% of that considered ideal for normal children of equivalent length.<BR/>One third of patients received less than minimum energy intake considered acceptable (80% of RDA for length) on 1 or more occasions.</P>

<P>A 3 year prospective, stratified, and randomised multicentre study. <BR/>After a run -in period of 6 months patients were stratified into 3 renal-disease categories 1) glomerular diseases 2) uropathy 3) congenital or hereditary nephropathy.<BR/>In each of these groups, patients were stratified into either progressive or non-progressive category based on change in creatinine clearance during that period.<BR/>Randomisation method: computerised random number generator in blocks of 4.<BR/>Allocation concealment: adequate.<BR/>Blinding<BR/>- participants: no<BR/>- investigators: no<BR/>- outcome assessors: no<BR/>- data analysts: no<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis: yes<BR/>Compliance: controlled by written dietary diaries and urea -N excretion. Two third patients complied.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Number: 226 children<BR/>Age: 2-18 years (mean 10.4 years); 69% male</P>
<P>EXCLUSION CRITERIA<BR/>Uncontrolled hypertension, uremic symptoms, systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, amyloidosis or oxalosis, severe cardiac disease or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs during previous 6 months.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>PROTEIN RESTRICTION GROUP<BR/>Lowest safe protein intake: 0.8-1.1 g/kg/d adjusted for age.</P>
<P>CONTROL<BR/>Un-restricted protein intake.</P>
<P>All patients advised to have a calorie intake of at least 70% of WHO recommendations</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Creatinine clearance (mL/min/m²) by Schwartz formula every 2 months.<BR/>2. Optional GFR done by inulin or chromium EDTA clearance method every 6-12 months.<BR/>3. BP.<BR/>4. Proteinuria.<BR/>5. Growth (anthropometry and biochemistry).<BR/>6. Lipid profile.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>The slope of regression line of creatinine clearance over time was used to calculate progression and patients with -3 mL/min/1.73 m² or less were defined as progressive.<BR/>Of the 226 patients randomised 191 completed 2 year study.<BR/>Progressive disease 91; non-progressive disease 100.<BR/>Diet group 97 and 94 in control group.<BR/>Patients in non-progressive group significantly younger (P &lt; 0.001), had higher creatinine clearance (P &lt; 0.001), lower systolic BP (P = 0.006) and diastolic BP (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
