<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Snoezelen (or multi-sensory stimulation) has become a commonly used intervention to manage maladaptive behaviours and to promote positive mood of older people with dementia. Originally, two randomised clinical trials were available for this review. Some short-term benefits were documented in promoting adaptive behaviours in people with dementia during and immediately after their participation in the sessions. In this update, two new trials were included and revealed two different forms of applying snoezelen to dementia care. One is a session-based snoezelen programme while the other is a 24-hour integrated snoezelen care programme. Both trials did not show any significant effects on behaviour, interaction, and mood of people with dementia. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-04-22 09:55:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Snoezelen, multi-sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils. The rationale for this lies in the proposition that the provision of a sensory environment for people with dementia places fewer demands on their intellectual abilities but capitalizes on their residual sensorimotor abilities. The clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make the examination of the therapeutic values of snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions.</P>

<P>Two new trials were included in this update. Baker 2003 was an expanded study of Baker 2001 reported in the previous version. Both Baker 2003 and van Weert 2005 examined the short-term and longer-term effects of snoezelen on behaviour, mood, and communication of people with moderate to severe dementia. The format of implementation was different in the two trials: one was session-based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003), whilst the other was a 24-hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005). Owing to the differences in study methodology, the results of the two trials were not pooled for analysis. The session-based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003) did not show any effects on behaviour, mood, cognition and communication / interaction in the short term (during or immediately after sessions) or longer term (at post-intervention or 1-month post-intervention follow-up). Likewise, the 24-hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005) failed to demonstrate any significant short-term and longer term effects on behaviour, mood and interaction. <BR/>

<P>A more vigorous review methodology was adopted in this update. The study of Kragt 1997, reported in the previous version, was excluded because the snoezelen programme only consisted of three sessions, which was considered too brief for a therapeutic intervention. Two new trials were reviewed. Meta-analyses could not be performed because of the limited number of trials and different study methods of the available trials. Overall, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of snoezelen for dementia. There is a need for more reliable and sound research-based evidence to inform and justify the use of snoezelen in dementia care.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-22 09:53:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Derived from two Dutch verbs, 'sniffen' and 'doezelen', snoezelen was first introduced in the 1970s as an intervention for people with learning disabilities, based on the rationale of reducing the adverse effects of sensory deprivation. Owing to their reduced cognitive abilities, people with learning disabilities are less ready to explore their environments for sensory inputs, and consequently they are likely to be deprived of adequate sensory stimulation. The expression of negative emotions and behaviours, such as vocally disruptive, self-stimulating, and apathetic behaviours, has been found to be associated with sensory deprivation (<LINK REF="REF-Cariaga-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cariaga 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1993</LINK>). Adopting a non-directive and enabling approach, snoezelen encourages people with reduced cognitive functions to engage with sensory stimuli in a positive and non-stressful environment (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Snoezelen has been described as a 'sensory cafeteria' or 'multi-sensory environment' because of its use of a variety of sensory-based materials and equipment. Pinkney 1997 describes snoezelen as a medium of providing sensory stimuli to the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils. Some researchers regard snoezelen as a 'multi-sensory therapy' in which people with dementia are encouraged to engage in a cognitively less demanding sensory environment (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Burns-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2000</LINK>). The goals of such therapy are to promote positive behaviours and to reduce maladaptive behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slevin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slevin 1999</LINK>). Whether snoezelen is considered simply as a multi-sensory environment or as a therapeutic medium has attracted significant debate. Proponents of the former school of thought have pointed out that the value of snoezelen lies in its aesthetic quality, and its use as a therapy undermines this characteristic (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1994</LINK>). Supporters of the therapeutic value of snoezelen are keen to explore its benefits for individuals with cognitive impairments (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Hulsegge-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulsegge 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kewin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kewin 1994</LINK>). In this review, snoezelen is regarded as a multi-sensory based intervention with embedded therapeutic values.</P>
<P>Over the past decade, the clinical application of snoezelen has been extended from the field of learning disabilities to the care of people with dementia. To a certain extent, these two groups of individuals share some common characteristics such as reduced cognitive functions and diminished communicative ability. However, people with dementia generally experience a gradual deterioration in all aspects of cognitive functions as the disease progresses. This progressive loss of cognitive abilities makes this group less suitable to participate in interventions that demand cognitive functions and communication ability. In addition, people with dementia are less competent and have a lower stress threshold for coping with environmental demands (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1986</LINK>). Maladaptive behaviours and affect occur when environmental stimulation exceeds an individual's adaptive level. On the other hand, too little sensory stimulation may lead to a decline in both cognition and function, and an increase in behavioural symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Kitwood-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitwood 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovach-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovach 1997</LINK>). Based on these two hypothesis of sensory overload and sensory deprivation, <LINK REF="REF-Kovach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovach 2000</LINK> put forward the model of sensoristasis, in which an equilibrium of the sensory state can be attained by balancing the pacing of sensory stimulating or sensory-calming activity.</P>
<P>The value of snoezelen (multi-sensory interventions) has been documented in promoting relaxation and positive behavioural changes (<LINK REF="REF-Deakin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deakin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1994</LINK>). Through the provision of non-sequential and unpatterned sensory stimuli, snoezelen capitalize on the residual sensorimotor abilities of dementia sufferers and present few attentional and intellectual demands (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beatty-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beatty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buettner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buettner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1998</LINK>). Moffat and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Moffat-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffat 1993</LINK>) pioneered the use of snoezelen for people with moderate to severe dementia and found that they enjoyed the sensory stimuli and remained calm during the sessions. These encouraging results promote the use of multi-sensory interventions in dementia care, and have provoked waves of clinical research on the examination of therapeutic values of snoezelen for people with dementia.</P>
<P>A review of the literature shows that snoezelen is commonly employed as a therapeutic modality in dementia care in four areas:<BR/>(1) reducing maladaptive behaviours and increasing positive behaviours (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Diepen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">van Diepen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Long-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1992</LINK>),<BR/>(2) promoting positive mood and affect (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinkney-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pinkney 1997</LINK>),<BR/>(3) facilitating interaction and communication (<LINK REF="REF-Spaull-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spaull 1998</LINK>), and<BR/>(4) promoting a caregiving relationship and reducing caregiving stress (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savage-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although snoezelen has become a popular clinical intervention for people with dementia, its application often varies in form, principles, duration, and subject groups. For instance, some researchers apply snoezelen in the form of structured procedures and sensory stimuli to groups of individuals with dementia (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Baillon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baillon 2005</LINK>), whereas others encourage dementia sufferers to explore sensory stimuli based on personal preferences (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>). Some studies integrated the principles of snoezelen in daily care (<LINK REF="REF-van-Weert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>) and exercise programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Heyn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Heyn 2003</LINK>). In the past few years, researchers and clinicians started integrating multi-sensory principles into leisure activity programmes such as gardening for people with dementia in nursing homes (<LINK REF="STD-Cox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 2004</LINK>). Such variations in application make the assessment of the therapeutic value of snoezelen difficult, which in turn undermines the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care.</P>
<P>While most studies used conventional assessment tools for behavior assessment such as the Behaviour Rating Scale (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>), some of them started using physiological parameters such as heart rate monitors to gauge subjects' responses prior to, during, and after snoezelen sessions (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Baillon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baillon 2005</LINK>). A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of Snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is deemed necessary to inform clinical application and research direction.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>In the original review (2002) and the subsequent update (2004), a total of 16 research papers were identified. The two reviewers independently studied the abstracts and full text of these papers, and selected those trials that met the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were discussed and resolved between the reviewers. Twelve papers were screened out: one examined non-dementia clients, six were review or discussion papers, one did not employ snoezelen or multi-sensory programme, one reported an observational study, and three were case studies with no randomizations. Based on the current selection criteria of trials, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Kragt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kragt 1997</LINK> that was included in the original review was excluded because the snoezelen intervention only consisted of three sessions. In view of the fact that snoezelen programmes reported in many studies were on a twice weekly basis (some even thrice weekly) for a duration of six to eight weeks, snoezelen sessions that lasted only three sessions are considered inadequate in designing the dose of the intervention.</P>
<P>In this update, seven new trial references were identified. The two reviewers independently reviewed the trial reports and selected those that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reviewers deliberated on the issues that arouse until a consensus was reached. Four trials were excluded: the study of <LINK REF="STD-Cox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 2004</LINK> was not randomized and consisted only three 16-minute sessions of intervention; the study of <LINK REF="STD-Heyn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Heyn 2003</LINK> was not randomized and had no comparison group; the study of <LINK REF="STD-van-Diepen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">van Diepen 2002</LINK> was a pilot one that aimed at assessing the feasibility and usefulness of the outcome measures; and the study conducted by Baillon (<LINK REF="STD-Baillon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baillon 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baillon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baillon 2005</LINK>) compared a three-session snoezelen intervention with a three-session reminiscence intervention and had no other control condition. The study of Sacks 2005 is a doctoral dissertation but was not available up to the time of this review. This study will hopefully be included in the next update. The two new trials included in this review are <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>. Indeed, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> is an extension of <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>The search of 2008 retrieved two studies, both of which have been excluded from the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The trials were examined to identify any potential sources of systematic bias. The criteria used in quality assessment are outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>), including randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and level of dropout at follow-up stage. Unlike pharmacological studies, blinding of psychosocial interventions is not always possible as subjects are generally aware of the nature of the intervention they are receiving. Studies in which an assessor is blind to the intervention were considered of having higher quality than those in which the same person performed both intervention and assessment. Blinding of group allocation was considered as far as possible, despite the fact that subjects were generally aware of the nature of intervention they were receiving. Trials were also examined to determine whether "intention-to-treat" analysis was used when performing statistical analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other quality assessment criteria include</HEADING>
<P>(a) The number and characteristics (e.g. level of cognitive functioning) of subjects involved in the study.<BR/>(b) The format and duration of intervention and control conditions.<BR/>(c) The levels of data utilized.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were mainly extracted from the published papers. Researchers of the trials would be contacted requesting essential information not contained in the published papers. The types of summary statistics extracted depended on the nature of the outcome data. When outcome data are dichotomous, the number in each of the two categories at baseline and post-interventions, and/or other measurement time points are collected. The odds ratio or risk ratio are extracted for effect estimates. When outcomes were continuous data, mean values and standard deviations at baseline, post-interventions, and/or other time points are extracted. Mean differences or standard mean differences were calculated for effect estimates. When outcomes were ordinal data, the type of data extracted depended on whether the analysis was of dichotomized data, continuous data, or ordinal data.</P>

<P>Adopting a parallel group experimental design, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK> investigated<BR/>(1) the immediate effects of snoezelen (multi-sensory stimulation; intervention) on the behaviours of older people with dementia,<BR/>(2) the carry-over effects of snoezelen on mood and behaviour to day hospitals and home environments, and<BR/>(3) the maintenance effects of snoezelen on mood, behaviour, and cognition over time.<BR/>Fifty day-hospital subjects diagnosed with dementia, with a mean age of 78 years, were recruited to the study. The subjects were at the moderate to advanced stages of dementia (mean MMSE of intervention group = 10.96, SD = 6.5; mean MMSE of control condition = 6.08, SD = 5.07). Using a computer-generated randomization system, the subjects were randomly allocated to the intervention group (one-to-one snoezelen) or the control group. All subjects attended eight 30-minute sessions of their assigned programme twice a week over a four-week period. Both intervention and control programmes were designed with a similar structure, except that the former (multi-sensory stimulation) adopted a non-directed and enabling approach. Subjects in the intervention group explored and received unpatterned and non-sequential sensory stimuli in a multi-sensory environment that placed no intellectual or physical demands on them. The control condition was a one-to-one activity programme that was developed based on individual subjects' preferences and abilities with no provision of obvious sensory inputs. Seven outcome measures were used. The immediate effects of snoezelen on behaviours, including within sessions and immediately after sessions, were measured by INTERACT (22-item) and INTERACT (12-item) respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1995</LINK>). The generalization effects were measured by three outcome measures: the General Behaviour and Community Skills sub-scales of REHAB (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1988</LINK>) measured the carryover effect to day hospitals; the Behaviour and Mood Disturbance Scale (BMD) and the Behaviour Rating Scale (BRS) of the Clifton Assessment Procedures for the Elderly (CAPE) measured the carryover effect to home, at mid- and post-intervention. The maintenance effect (at the one-month post-intervention follow-up) on behaviours and cognition were measured by REHAB, BMD, the Cognitive Assessment Scale (CAS) of CAPE and MMSE.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> is considered an expanded study of <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK> because data of the latter were included in the former for analysis. Using a randomized controlled trial design, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> enrolled subjects from three European countries (UK, Netherlands, Sweden) to examine the effects of snoezelen on the behaviour, mood, and cognition of older people with dementia. One hundred and thirty-six subjects with moderate to severe dementia were included: 94 from the UK, 26 from the Netherlands, and 16 from Sweden. Subjects in the UK attended day hospitals, whilst those in the Netherlands and Sweden were inpatients of psychogeriatric wards. The mean ages of snoezelen group and control group were 81 and 83 years respectively. There was significant group difference in mean MMSE scores (data from the UK and the Netherlands only) between the snoezelen group (9.4) and the control group (6.7) (p=.01). Subjects were randomized assigned, using PEPI epidemiology software package, to the snoezelen or control group. All subjects attended eight 30-minute sessions on a one-to-one basis according to their group assignment. The sessions were conducted by the same key workers throughout the study period. Similar to the design of <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>, the snoezelen group focused on sensory experience with no intellectual and physical demands and used a non-directed and enabling approach, whilst the controls attended activity sessions involving intellectual and/or physical demands and adopted a directive approach.</P>
<P>Three outcome measures were used to examine the short-term effects of snoezelen on behaviours:<BR/>(1) INTERACT (22-item) measured behaviours during the sessions,<BR/>(2) INTERACT (12-item) measured behaviours 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the sessions, and<BR/>(3) Behaviour Observation Scale for intra-mural psycho-geriatrics (GIP) measured behaviours that were videotaped during the sessions for the Netherlands sample.</P>
<P>The longer term effects of snoezelen were measured by five outcome measures:<BR/>(1) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) evaluated cognitive function,<BR/>(2) the Behaviour Rating Scale (BRS) of Clifton Assessment Procedures of Elderly evaluated changes in behaviours at home (UK sample) or in the wards (Netherlands and Sweden samples),<BR/>(3) the Rehabilitation Evaluation Hall and Baker tool (REHAB) evaluated behaviours during the normal regime of a day hospital (UK sample),<BR/>(4) the GIP evaluated behaviours on wards (Netherlands sample), and<BR/>(5) the Behaviour and Mood Disturabance Scale (BMD) evaluated subjects' mood at home (UK sample). The MMSE, BRS, and GIP were administered at pre-and post-intervention; whilst REHAB and BMD were administered at pre-, mid-, post-intervention, and one-month post-intervention follow up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK> reported the same trial in two papers. Her trial aimed at investigating the effects of snoezelen when integrated into 24-hour daily care on nursing home residents with dementia. One of the papers reported the effects of the 24-hour snoezelen care programme on mood and behaviours, whilst the other reported the effects of the programme on communication of older people with dementia. Twelve psychogeriatric wards in six nursing homes (out of 19 homes) were recruited to the study. A cluster randomized design was used to assign the wards to either experimental (integrated snoezelen care programme) or control (usual activity) condition. However, two wards were not randomized assigned because of some practical considerations such as the presence of a snoezelen room in the ward. Residents of these wards were selected when they fulfilled the criteria of having moderate to severe dementia and with moderate to severe level of nursing care dependency.</P>
<P>At baseline, 125 subjects were recruited and were assigned to experimental condition or control condition according to the ward in which they stayed. The mean age of experimental group was 84 years whilst that of control group was 83 years. The proportions of females in experimental and control groups were 79% and 83% respectively (the number of subjects participated in the tests and analysis). For the experimental group, subjects were given a stimulus-preference screening in 10 weekly one-hour sessions to identify their favoured sensory stimuli. Thereafter, individual snoezelen care plans were developed for each participant based on their life history, stimulus preference, and discussions from multidisciplinary conferences. Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) used multi-sensory stimuli in the 24-hour care of the experimental subjects. Subjects in the control group were provided with usual care on an individual basis. A minimum period of three months was used for both experimental and control conditions.</P>
<P>The short-term effects of integrated snoezelen care programme on behaviors were measured using a modified version of INTERACT, in which six items were deleted and eight new items were added, during morning care sessions.</P>
<P>The long-term effects of integrated snoezelen care programmes on behaviors, mood, and interaction were evaluated at the 18-month follow-up using the following outcome measures:<BR/>(1) eight items of GIP measured the occurrence of maladaptive behaviors such as apathetic, anxious, and disoriented behaviours,<BR/>(2) the Dutch version of CMAI measured the frequency of three categories of agitated behaviours, including aggressive, physically non-aggressive, and verbally agitated behaviours,<BR/>(3) the Cornell Scale for Depression measured depressive symptoms such as mood-related signs, and<BR/>(4) a three-face diagram (FACE) rated three types of mood (happy, neutral, sad).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>: A computer-generated randomization system was used to assign subjects to the experimental group (multi-sensory stimulation sessions) or the control group (activity sessions).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>: As in the 2001 study, a computer-generated randomization system was used in subject assignment. The study had specific inclusion criteria for its sample. However, subjects in the United Kingdom (UK) were patients of a day hospital, while in the Netherlands and Sweden, the subjects were residents of a psychogeriatric ward, which could mean potential differences between these two groups forming the sample. In addition, only 136 out of 156 subjects were randomized, compromising the randomization process. Twenty subjects from the Netherlands were not randomized because eight of them were transferred to another ward, five died, three did not give consent, and the carers of four of the subjects did not respond to the invitation to participate. The whole area is problematic because Baker and team should not have randomized those who had not given consent (including those not responding to invitations) in the first place. It is not clear whether those who were transferred and those who died had given consent.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>: A study with a quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design. The six nursing homes that participated in the study were selected out of 19 potentially eligible sites. It is not clear whether these six participating nursing homes were randomly selected. A cluster randomization method was used to allocate two wards of each nursing home to either the experimental group or the control group. No information was given as to how the two wards were selected. The wards of two nursing homes did not undergo the randomization process. Such arrangements could have confounded subject recruitment. Reportedly, subjects in the experimental group were found to have more behavioural problems at baseline.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>: All staff, including key workers, hospital staff, research assistants, and carers, were aware that a study was being carried out in which two equally valid therapies were being implemented for comparison. All key workers involved were asked to implement the programmes (both treatment and control) based on the written guidelines and standardized procedures. The subjects were not blind to the study because of their participation in the programmes.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>: The same key workers (who delivered the intervention or control conditions) were assigned whenever possible. All key workers received equivalent training. They were not blind to the study despite the intervention and the control (activity sessions) were presented as two equally valid care approaches.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>: Each subject was matched with a certified nursing assistant (CNA), who had to be familiar with the resident. The CNAs of the experimental and control group did not differ significantly in terms of their background characteristics but it is not clear whether they were randomized to the two groups. The CNAs of the experimental group received professional training on the implementation of snoezelen but those of the control group did not. The former group also had the support of a study group and follow-up meetings for guidance on implementation of the intervention. No information was given as to whether these CNAs were informed of the study. It was likely that they were aware of the study as they were told about the videotaped morning care sessions and the two groups of CNAs were prepared in a very different manner.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>: Subjects lost to the study were being accounted for. The authors stated that they used the "intention-to-treat" principle for data analysis. However, only 127 subjects' data were included in the final analysis although the number of subjects in the randomized sample was 136.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>: Substantial dropouts were noted for both subjects and CNAs. Thirty-seven CNAs (19 in the experimental group and 18 in the control group) of 117 were lost to follow-up, mainly because they changed jobs. They were replaced by new CNAs. Only 61 subjects out of 125 subjects completed the study. Information about drop-outs among patients/residents in both experimental and control groups was provided. To compensate for the dropouts occurring during the study period, a second cohort of subjects were recruited to replace the dropouts from the first cohort so as to have a sufficient sample size for a more reliable statistical analysis. According to the researchers, the analysis were conducted in conformity with "intention-to- treat" principle. Multilevel analysis using MLwiN-software was used for analyzing the data. By using multilevel analysis, the authors maintained that the statistical analyses were carried out following the "intention-to-treat" principle: all data available were included in the analysis. However, there were subjects in both experimental and control groups excluded from pre- and post-intervention analysis because of missing values and being non-completers, and were not included in the 'intention-to-treat" analysis. Moreover, the authors did not include the attrition rate (e.g. 20 - 30%) when calculating the sample size prior to the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>: INTERACT was rated by the key workers. INTERACT (12-item) and REHAB were rated by day hospital staff. The BMD was rated by family carers at home with the aid of a research assistant; the BRS, MMSE, and the CAS of CAPE were also rated by three research assistants. All raters were aware of the study, and both programmes were presented as two equally valid therapies for comparison.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>: The subjects were mostly unaware of the intervention or control conditions. The INTERACT (22-item) were administered by the key worker who delivered the intervention, thus possibly leading to detection bias. The INTERACT (12-item), used to record behaviour prior to and immediately post-session was not performed by the key worker but by a member of the nursing staff, therefore possibly minimizing detection bias. The detection of outcomes in this study was further complicated by the use of different instruments in different participating countries. For example, the REHAB was used only in the UK, and the GIP was used only in the Netherlands. The two members of nursing staff that completed the REHAB was trained, but there was no information on the GIP between the two nurses. Such a difference in instrumentation across the participating centres may have led to confusing result interpretation and limited generalization.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>: The outcomes was studied by observing residents on the wards and video recordings of morning care. The matched CNAs assessed the subjects of their behaviour in the ward environment. The raters were therefore not blinded, but the researcher reported that their ratings did not indicate deviations from those of the independent assessors for a 15% of the study sample.. The video assessment of behaviour during morning care, however, was performed by research assistants blinded to group assignment.</P>

<P>As <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> included the data (n = 50) of <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>, and therefore only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>) were included in the analysis. A total of 246 subjects was included, 122 in the experimental (snoezelen) group and 126 in the control group. The data of the two trials were not pooled for meta-analyses for two reasons. Firstly, the nature and structure of snoezelen in <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK> were not the same. The former structured snoezelen in form of sessions whilst the latter integrated snoezelen into 24-hour care. Secondly, only two trials were available for this review. The authors therefore conducted a systematic analysis instead of a meta-analysis. Most data were derived from sub scales of the outcome measures.</P>
<P>The data presented in the following sections were derived from sub scales / items of the outcome measures, thus limiting the result interpretation for the efficacy of snoezelen on the overall behaviours and performance of subjects with dementia even though significant effects on individual sub scales / items were obtained.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects on behavior</HEADING>
<P>In comparison with the controls (activity session), the session-based snoezelen (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>) did not show any significant effect on behaviours during sessions, immediately after sessions, at mid-, post-, or one-month post-intervention follow-up. The 24-hour integrated snoezelen-care programme (<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>) showed significant effect on two behavioural items of INTERACT during sessions: enjoying self (MD = -0.74; 95% CI (-1.29, -0.19); z = 2.62, P = 0.01) and bored/inactive (MD = -0.56; 95% CI (-1.11, -0.01); z = 1.99, P = 0.05). The results favoured the treatment. There were no longer-term treatment effects of the integrated snoezelen-care programme on behaviour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects on mood</HEADING>
<P>When compared with the controls (activity session), the session-based snoezelen (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>) show no significant effect on mood during sessions or at post-intervention. The 24-hour integrated snoezelen care programme (<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>) showed significant improvements in one mood item of INTREACT during sessions: the snoezelen group was happier and more content (MD = -0.84; 95% CI (-1.39, -0.29); z = 2.98, P = 0.003) and rated more positively on FACE (MD = -0.33; 95% CI (-0.61, -0.05); z = 2.33, P = 0.02).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects on cognition</HEADING>
<P>When compared with the control group, there were no significant effects of the session-based snoezelen (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>) on cognition.

</SUBSECTION>

<P>When compared with the control group, no significant effects of the session-based snoezelen (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>) on communication/interaction were evident during or immediately after sessions. Although the results of 'recalled memories' favoured the snoezelen group (MD = 0.42, 95% CI (0.11, 0.73), z = 2.67, P = 0.008), it was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> that this effect disappeared when the baseline MMSE scores of the two groups were taken into account.</P>
<P>As for the integrated snoezelen care programme (<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>), there were improvements during sessions for three interaction items of INTERACT: 'related well' (MD = 0.52; 95% CI (0.24, 0.80); z = 3.68, P = 0.0002), 'normal-length sentence' (MD = 0.31, 95% CI (0.03, 0.59), z = 2.19, P = 0.03), and 'responding to speaking' (MD = 0.30; 95% CI (0.02, 0.58); z = 2.12, P = 0.03).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-22 10:05:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>A more vigorous review methodology has been adopted in this update. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Kragt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kragt 1997</LINK>, reported in the original review, is now excluded because the snoezelen programme only consisted of three sessions, which was considered too brief for a therapeutic intervention. Three new trials were identified, but one of them (Sacks 2005) was not available at the time of this review. Therefore, only two trials were added. Since the study of <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> included the data from <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>, these two studies were considered as one. All in all, only two trials were included for the final analysis.</P>
<P>Overall, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of snoezelen for dementia.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> adopted a larger-scale multi-centre study design (n = 136 vs. n = 50 in <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>) to examine the clinical effects of snoezelen on dementia, its study methodology had a major limitation. It included data of the 50 subjects of Baker 2001, which implies that the investigators had already known the study outcomes when implementing the second half of the study in collaboration with the centres of two other countries. Moreover, the study was limited by the variation of subject characteristics, outcome measures, and unequal sample size in the three centres. With regard to subject characteristics, day patients were recruited for the UK centre, whilst residents of psychogeriatric wards were recruited for the Netherlands and Sweden. As for outcome measures, the three centres did not use the same set of outcome measures. For instance, the UK centres used REHAB to measure the carry-over effect of behaviour to ward, whilst the Netherlands centre used GIP. The differences in outcome measures as used in different centres weakened the data interpretation as well as reducing the power of the analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK> did not include the relatively small sample size in Sweden (n =10) for statistical analysis, thus further reducing the power to detect statistical differences.</P>
<P>Although the study of <LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK> suggested that the application of the principles of snoezelen (multi-sensory stimulation) into daily care activities seemed to be beneficial in reducing maladaptive behaviors, promoting mood, and encouraging interaction, the benefits were considered non-significant because they were indicated for individual symptoms rather than overall performance. Moreover, these benefits were only seen briefly during the sessions and were lost immediately afterwards. No benefits of integrated snoezelen care were shown in the daily ward routines. There were two major limitations in this trial. First, new residents who fulfilled the selection criteria and new nursing assistants were recruited to replace a substantial number of dropouts (both subjects and CNAs) in the middle of the study. This arrangement not only resulted in unequal treatment duration of subjects of the original group and the replacement group but also violated the 'intention to treat' principle. The investigators should have included the attrition rate in the sample size calculation prior to the study. Second, owing to the inclusion of a new cohort of subjects, the subjects included for analysis might not have received the same degree of treatment. Those subjects who were recruited at the beginning and completed the whole trial had a longer exposure to treatment (up to 15 months) than those who recruited at a later phase of the study (a minimum of three months as clarified by van Weert). Although the researchers said that the inter grated snoezelen programme would be effective at the residents' level within three months (personal email communication, 20 December 2006), there is a concern that the subjects included for analyses were unequal in terms of the dosage of the intervention received. It is not clear whether the results would be any different if all subjects received a similar intensity of integrated snoezelen care, but it is clear that the data credibility would be enhanced with improvements in the design of the research work.</P>
<P>To sum up, the methodological quality of the two trials were considered as inadequate for three reasons. First, both trials did not start with a sound research plan and were conducted in stages with an attempt to achieve the optimal sample size. The investigators should have included the attrition rate in the sample size calculation prior to the study. Second, the two trials lacked methodological rigor especially in aspects of subject recruitment, the randomization process, and a non-uniform use of instruments across participating centres. Third, both trials reported results of the sub scales/items of the outcome measures, thus orienting towards individual symptoms rather than the overall performance of behaviours and mood.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>From the practice perspective, snoezelen is mainly used as a psychosocial intervention for the management of maladaptive behaviours and promoting mood and communication in people with dementia. In this update, there were no evidences showing the efficacy of snoezelen on behaviours, mood, and interaction of people with dementia. substantive review, a session-based snoezelen program (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>) did not suggest any positive effects on behaviour, mood, and interaction either in the immediate or longer-term. Although the integrated snoezelen care approach (<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>) suggests immediate effects of snoezelen on behaviour and mood, the results were inconclusive because the outcomes were oriented towards individual symptoms rather than overall performance. </P>
<P>Trials included or not included in this review suggest that there are two forms of snoezelen in dementia care: <BR/>(1) the conventional session-based programme, and <BR/>(2) integrated snoezelen care. Each form of implementation has its strengths and limitations. <BR/>The session-based snoezelen programme is easier to structure as a therapeutic intervention and makes lower demands on manpower. However, this format of programme is limited by frequency, intensity and duration. The strength of 24-hour integrated snoezelen care is that it cultivates a care culture by fostering24-hour practice of the principles of multi-sensory stimulation for people with dementia. Supposedly, the philosophy and values of integrated snoezelen care will be internalized by all staff in the care facilities, ensuring the application of snoezelen principles during their daily care. Once a 'snoezelen care culture' is established, its implementation is continuous and ongoing. Nonetheless, there is a high demand on manpower, resources for staff training, and ongoing monitoring and reinforcement during continual implementation. To date, no studies have compared the clinical effects of the two forms of snoezelen practice. Clinicians are suggested to implement the form of snoezelen practice that matches with the existing resources and constraints. Most importantly, a systematic collection of scientific evidence about the snoezelen practice will further the understanding of the efficacy of snoezelen for people dementia. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>From the research perspective, the major work ahead is to conduct more empirical and scientific studies of snoezelen for people with dementia. First of all, the methodological rigour of snoezelen studies should be further enhanced. There are now a few more clinical trials reported in the literature, a couple of which were randomized controlled trials. Yet in these reported studies, the randomization processes were compromised, pointing to the need for randomization processes to be better controlled before there can be valid comparisons. Second, the natures of both interventions and controls were different in the RCTs examined in this review, thus making the comparison and generalization of results less feasible. It is difficult to compare snoezelen programmes that were session-based with those integrated into daily 24-hour care. Some snoezelen programmes were very short (e.g., three sessions in two weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Baillon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baillon 2005</LINK>) while other studies introduced an intervention package of a longer duration (e.g., eight sessions within four weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2005</LINK>) adopted regular care as the control condition, whereas another (<LINK REF="STD-Baillon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baillon 2005</LINK>) employed a reminiscence program as the control condition. Further research should focus more on the design of snoezelen programmes (e.g. nature, frequency and duration) that are comparable to the existing RCTs, as well as the control conditions that are comparable with the intervention. Third, more multi-center trials have been reported, but unfortunately these trials did not always adopt the same protocol. Recruitment criteria, as well as the use of assessment tools, were not always the same in these studies. Better coordinated efforts are needed among collaborative partners. Fourth, although existing research provides little information regarding at which stage of dementia (or level of cognitive impairment) clients can benefit most from snoezelen programmes, we are beginning to see reports on the impact of the severity of dementia upon outcomes (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2003</LINK>). The information is still limited in this respect. Thus it would be worth examining this aspect in future research. Fifth, there have been only limited studies examining the carry-over and long-term effects of snoezelen for people with dementia, so further research should be performed to examine these areas. The relationship between the "dose" of the intervention and its outcomes need to be more closely examined. Sixth, there is a need to investigate not just the effects of the two forms of snoezelen practice (session-based or integrated approach), but also to examine their similarities and differences as well as comparing their outcomes. Finally, the literature suggests that snoezelen might promote therapeutic relationships and quality of care. Further research could be done to examine whether snoezelen promotes a therapeutic relationship between clients and staff, as well as looking at the quality of care. Researchers would need to look for or develop instruments that are sensitive enough to capture changes in therapeutic relationship between care recipients and care providers, which can be quite a daunting task. </P>
<P>The clinical application of snoezelen needs to be adequately supported by scientific evidence, despite its popular use in dementia care. Without a well-developed evidence-based practice, snoezelen will merely be used as a general programme to occupy people with dementia without a meaningful purpose. In addition, resources such as the manpower and the costs of setting up a snoezelen environment cannot be justified without such evidence. In conclusion, there is a need for more reliable and sound research-based evidences to inform and justify the use of snoezelen in dementia care.<BR/>
