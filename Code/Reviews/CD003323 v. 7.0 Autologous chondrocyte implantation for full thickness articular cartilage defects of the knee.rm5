<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-13 09:19:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>A layer of cartilage covering the knee joint surfaces acts to protect the joint and reduce friction. Damage to the cartilage (articular surface) can decrease mobility of the joint and cause pain on movement. Continuing deterioration of the surface may lead to osteoarthritis. Treatments for damaged cartilage include relieving symptoms, surgically cleaning up the joint, or surgically re-establishing the cartilage layer. The latter is done using marrow stimulation techniques (such as microfracture), mosaicplasty (also known as osteochondral cylinder transplantation), and more recently with implantation of healthy cartilage cells (chondrocytes). In the technique of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), a small piece of cartilage is retrieved from the knee joint. This piece is brought to a laboratory where it is digested to free the chondrocyte cells; these cells are subsequently cultured in a culture media in order to expand the numbers of cells. Then, with a second surgery, the cells are placed into the joint defect in an effort to produce a tissue that substitutes the normal cartilage.</P>
<P>This review includes six small randomised controlled trials that compared ACI with either mosaicplasty or microfracture. Although there are some promising results for ACI compared with microfracture from one trial, the evidence from two other trials testing the same comparison did not confirm these. None of the other three trials testing different comparisons provided conclusive evidence in favour of ACI, although the longer-term results suggest that the results for some types of ACI may improve over time. The review identified several ongoing trials that should help to provide evidence to inform on the use of ACI in the future. Meanwhile, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the use of ACI.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-13 09:34:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Six heterogeneous trials were identified with 442 participants. Methodological flaws of the included trials included incomplete follow-up and inadequate reporting of outcomes. Three trials compared ACI versus mosaicplasty. One reported statistically significant results in favour of ACI at one year in the numbers of people with 'good' or 'excellent' functional results. Conversely, another trial found significant improvement for the mosaicplasty group when assessed using one functional scoring system at two years, but no statistically significant differences based on two other scoring systems. A third trial found no difference between ACI and mosaicplasty, 10 months on average after the surgery.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcomes at two years in a single trial comparing ACI with microfracture nor in the functional results at 18 months of a single trial comparing characterised chondrocyte implantation versus microfracture. However, the results at 36 months for this trial seemed to indicate better functional results for characterised chondrocyte implantation compared with those for microfracture. The sixth trial comparing matrix-guided ACI versus microfracture found significantly better results for functional outcomes at two year follow-up in the MACI group.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-12 22:49:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-09-01 13:32:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cartilage provides coverage for bones in their joint surfaces. Its role is essential in decreasing the friction between the joining bones and it also decreases the mechanical load effect on the covered bone. Loss of cartilage and exposure of the subchondral bone may produce crepitation and pain during the joint movements, and repeated joint effusions (<LINK REF="REF-Buckwalter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckwalter 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cartilage consists of cells (chondrocytes), water and extracellular matrix of collagen (mainly type II), proteoglycans and noncollagenous proteins. In mature articular cartilage, chondrocytes no longer divide and receive their nutrition mainly through diffusion from the synovial fluid. This limits their intrinsic capacity for repair and, thus, cartilage lesions are very difficult to heal. If left untreated lesions are more likely to deteriorate, subsequently exposing the subchondral bone or forming fibrous tissue. The latter, even when successfully covering underlying bone, does not provide adequate mechanical and functional support and is subject to wear over time. Thus, no normal hyaline cartilage is formed and, furthermore, there is usually no improvement of the person's symptoms in the long term.</P>
<P>Isolated lesions to cartilage should be differentiated from osteoarthritis, which refers to diffuse damage to the articular surface, is more common in older people and is generally considered to be irreversible. Non-osteoarthritis cartilage lesions are most often found in younger people and are more subject to various treatment alternatives aiming to cartilage repair or reconstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-12 22:49:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no uniform approaches to managing defects to cartilage. Surgical treatment options, intending primarily to achieve symptomatic relief with the least amount of invasive intervention (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>), are usually divided into marrow-stimulating (reparative) and reconstructive techniques. Marrow-stimulating techniques such as subchondral drilling, abrasion arthroplasty, spongialisation or microfractures allow bone marrow cells derived from the subchondral bone to migrate into the cartilage lesion area (<LINK REF="REF-Ficat-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ficat 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steadman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steadman 2003</LINK>). The aim of these techniques is to replenish cartilage through the recruitment of progenitor cells as potential cartilage precursors, allowing the development into chondrogenic cells and, finally, cartilage.</P>
<P>Reconstructive techniques use autografts, allografts or synthetic material for restoring the lesion area. The use of autogenous periosteal or perichondrial grafts has been proposed in the past but is not extensively used. Allografts, synthetic polymers or ceramics are often used, usually in forms of osteochondral cylindrical plugs to reconstruct or replace the lesion area (<LINK REF="REF-Ghazavi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghazavi 1997</LINK>). Mosaicplasty (osteochondral cylinder transplantation) uses small cylindrical autografts harvested from less weight-bearing areas of the femoral condyle articular surface (e.g. intercondylar notch) and placed in the cartilage defect (<LINK REF="REF-Hangody-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hangody 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Marrow-stimulating techniques have offered an easy-to-perform treatment option for full thickness cartilage lesions of the knee. However, according to several studies, repair tissue is mainly fibrotic and lacks the biomechanical and viscoelastic characteristics of normal hyaline cartilage. Thus, clinical results appear to be inferior, unpredictable and not durable compared to other techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Minas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minas 1998</LINK>). In addition, reconstructive techniques also have not managed to provide impressive clinical results. Mosaicplasty, the most common technique, is considered technically difficult procedure not easily performed by the average surgeon. The uses of synthetic grafts have not been extensively studied and only a few cohort studies have been published.</P>
<P>Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was introduced in Sweden in 1987, being the first biological approach to the management of cartilage lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Brittberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittberg 1994</LINK>). ACI of the knee is a two-stage procedure. The initial stage involves arthroscopy, where the knee is examined, the lesion is evaluated and small pieces of healthy cartilage are harvested from a less weight-bearing area (usually the femoral notch or the medial or lateral rim of trochlea). Individual chondrocytes are isolated in vitro by collagenase digestion, cultured in media containing patient's serum, and, following a period of cellular division, chondrocytes are retrieved for re-implantation.</P>
<P>Re-implantation is the second stage of the process. A parapatellar arthrotomy is undertaken and the defect is debrided to the subchondral bone. Through a second incision, a periosteal patch is harvested from the proximal medial tibia and sutured to the defect rim. Fibrin glue or sealant is applied to the peripheral border of the patch to create a watertight seal. Then, the harvested chondrocytes are injected beneath the periosteal patch (<LINK REF="REF-Brittberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittberg 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surgical techniques and technologies have undergone substantial development since the procedure was introduced. For instance, the above-described operative techniques are considered conventional, first generation approaches. 'Second generation' ACI techniques use manufactured cell carriers such as <I>MACI </I>(Verigen AG, Leverkusen, Germany) aiming to provide and stabilise the cells to the defect area (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2005</LINK>). Moreover, other materials like collagen membranes may be used in place of periosteum (type I/III collagen membrane (<I>ChondroGide</I>; Geistlich, Wollhausen, Switzerland or <I>Restore</I>; De Puy, Warzaw, Indiana, USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Gooding-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gooding 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinwachs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinwachs 2007</LINK>). These materials aim to decrease operation time, limit surgical trauma and avoid complications attributed to the use of periosteum (e.g. graft overgrowth).</P>
<P>'Third generation' ACI uses three-dimensional (3D) matrices such as hyaluronic acid (<I>Hyalograft-C</I>; Fidia, Italy) as scaffolds (<LINK REF="REF-Kon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marcacci-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcacci 2005</LINK>). Chondrocytes are cultured in these scaffolds in a 3D culture before implanting in the lesion area. The process of implantation (i.e. the second stage of the procedure) in second and third generation techniques can also be performed arthroscopically or with a small incision (<LINK REF="REF-Brittberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittberg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A new technique called 'Characterized Chondocyte Implantation' (CCI) (ChondroCelect, TiGenix NV, Haasrode, Belgium) aims to improve the results of articular regeneration with chondrocyte cell therapy through the use of a selected cell population. Characterised chondrocytes are an expanded population of chondrocytes that expresses a marker profile (a gene score) potentially predictive of the capacity to form hyaline-like cartilage in vivo in a consistent and reproducible manner. The surgical technique is performed as the conventional ACI, however with the use of selected-characterised chondrocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Dell_x0027_Accio-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dell'Accio 2003</LINK>). With the CCI technique, there is a selection of patients with high potential for success; thus, there is a possibility that the cells will not be implanted due to a low potential of the patient's chondrocytes to give satisfactory clinical results (shown as a low gene score).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-03-08 15:35:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>A number of studies have suggested the effectiveness of ACI for cartilage defects of the knee (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaslav-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaslav 2009</LINK>). Cohort studies have also shown a durability of good and excellent results in terms of clinical evaluation or histological assessment of biopsies, even up to 11 years after the implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Brun-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2002</LINK>). Supporters of this technique highlight that it is the only biological approach to chondral defects, suggesting the efficiency gained by using chondrocytes for the restoration of cartilage. However, ACI has its limitations. It demands a steeper learning curve, at least compared with marrow-stimulating techniques. It is also an expensive procedure with a considerable rate of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-09-01 13:32:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cartilage lesions are common in the general population and are more often anticipated in young and physically active people. Curl and colleagues report an incidence of chondral lesions in 63% of the 31,516 performed arthroscopies, with an average of 2.7 lesions per knee (<LINK REF="REF-Curl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curl 1997</LINK>). In 1000 consecutive arthroscopies examined by Hjelle and colleagues, chondral or osteochondral lesions of any type were found in 61% and focal defects were found in 19% (<LINK REF="REF-Hjelle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hjelle 2002</LINK>). ACI is a relatively new technique with promising results. However, the clinical benefits and potential harms remain unclear.</P>

<P>In our first update in 2006, four trials comparing ACI with any other type of cartilage repair surgery were included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Basad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basad 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>). In the second update in 2010, we also included two new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>), and one (<LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK>) which was a longer-term follow-up of an already included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>). We found another study previously categorised as excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Horas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horas 2000</LINK>) to be another publication of an already included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>). In the current third update in 2011, searches were performed in January 2011. One trial report, previously in studies awaiting assessment, <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> was a full report of an already included trial (<LINK REF="REF-Basad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basad 2004</LINK>). Given that <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> reported a greater number of participants, with a more complete follow-up, we considered that this should be considered the definitive publication of this trial. A longer term follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> was also included (<LINK REF="REF-Saris-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saris 2009</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>Of the six included trials, five were randomised trials and one (<LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>) was quasi-randomised.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> is the same study as <LINK REF="REF-Horas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horas 2000</LINK> (formerly excluded as a non-randomised study in our review). <LINK REF="REF-Horas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horas 2000</LINK> was not cited in the 2003 report, but the response of the trial authors to a letter (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>) commenting on <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> confirmed that "the same patient population formed the basis for both the German publication (<LINK REF="REF-Horas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horas 2000</LINK>) and the present article. However, different individual aspects of the treatment's results were highlighted, especially in the Discussion sections of the two articles". Both these articles report follow-up at 24 months. However, because of differences in the presentation of outcomes between the two main reports of <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> and the availability of raw data for <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>, we chose only to review the 2003 report.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK> is a five-year follow-up evaluation of <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>, which reported on two-year follow-up after surgery in the 2004 article. As the information on the study design was better described in <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>, we based the risk of bias assessment on this report.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Saris-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saris 2009</LINK> presented the 36 month follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>. Data from different follow-up times were extracted from both publications. <LINK REF="REF-Van-Assche-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Assche 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Van-Assche-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Assche 2010</LINK> studied a subgroup of <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> from two centres (one Belgium and one Dutch).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> was a full report of <LINK REF="REF-Basad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basad 2004</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> was conducted in the same centre during the same time, and using the same follow-up time of two years. The authors included more participants and presented the outcomes in a more complete and relevant way. Therefore, we considered that <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> was the definitive report of this trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>The six included studies recruited a total of 442 participants. Based on reported allocation, 237 had one of the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) techniques and 205 had either microfractures or mosaicplasty. In the former, 94 trial participants had ACI with the use of periosteum, 46 had ACI with the use of collagen membrane, 57 had characterised chondrocyte implantation (CCI) and 40 had matrix-guided ACI (MACI). <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> assessed 58 ACI-treated participants, 12 of which had the technique with periosteum and 46 with collagen membrane as a coverage of the lesion area. In the control groups, 121 participants had microfractures and 84 had mosaicplasty.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Three trials were single-centre trials, two of which were based in Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>) and one in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> was a multi-centre study with three surgeons and involvement from five orthopaedic centres in Italy. <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> was a multi-centre study involving four centres in Norway and one in the UK. <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> was a multi-centre study undertaken in 13 centres in four countries (Belgium, Croatia, Germany and the Netherlands).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> was sponsored by TiGenix n.x. Eight authors of this study declared a conflict of interest. One or more of the authors in <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> also declared a conflict of interest (details not provided).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The participants of all the studies had isolated cartilage lesions of the femur or the patella. The average size of the lesions was homogenous, ranging between 3.8 cm² and 5.1 cm² for three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>, the acceptable size of the lesion for trial inclusion was between 4 cm² and 10 cm²; however, <LINK REF="REF-Basad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basad 2004</LINK> reported a lower limit of 2 cm². In <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>
, the size of treated lesions was much smaller: <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> had an average size of 2.0 cm² and 1.9 cm²<SUP> </SUP>for ACI and mosaicplasty respectively, while the mean size of cartilage lesions in <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> was 2.5 cm².</P>
<P>There were important differences in the inclusion criteria of the included studies (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> included only participants with femoral condyle lesions, while the other trials included lesions at other sites (mainly patella lesions). Cases with osteochondritis dissecans were excluded by <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> but were included in remaining trials. Osteochondral lesions were also withdrawn from <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>. Concomitant lesions (anterior cruciate ligament ruptures or meniscal tears) were not excluded in <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>. Acording to the protocol, <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> excluded patients with prior or planned meniscectomies (&gt;30% of the meniscus) or knee instability. However, one microfracture patient had an ACL reconstruction. Five patients (two in the MACI and three in the microfracture group) had smaller meniscal lesions treated.</P>
<P>Other sources of between-trial variation included differences in the history of previous surgery and baseline clinical scores: for instance, the ACI group had a Lysholm score of 24.9 in <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> and 57.4 in <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>The average ages of trial participants in the individual trials ranged between 29 years (<LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK>) and 34 years (<LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>). All six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>) included more male than female participants (60% or more of all participants were males).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Four different comparisons were tested by the six included trials. Three trials compared ACI with mosaicplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> clarified that they used autologous periosteum for the coverage of the cartilage lesion and the implanted cells. In the ACI group, <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> used either periosteum or collagen membrane. <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> compared ACI (using periosteum) versus microfractures. <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> compared MACI with microfractures and <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> compared characterised chondrocyte implantation (CCI) with microfractures.</P>
<P>Where described, the rehabilitation programmes differed between the studies (<I>see</I> the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> used a cast to keep the knee in extension for the first 10 days, and encouraged full-weight bearing at 24 hours postoperatively. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> allowed flexion up to 90 degrees for the first 10 days with partial weight-bearing at two weeks and full weight-bearing at 12 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> used a different rehabilitation program for each of the treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Several different outcomes were presented by the trials (Lysholm score, Tegner, modified Cincinnati, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, Mayes, KOOS: Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, patient rated ICRS and SF-36). Only <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> provided raw data of all the outcomes measured (Lysholm, Tegner, Meyers, complications). <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>, and the longer term follow-up report (<LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK>), presented histograms or box plots but not numerical data for functional and pain outcomes (Lysholm, VAS, SF-36). Although specified in the methods section, the Tegner score is not presented in <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> and only the mean baseline and final scores are presented in <LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>Four trials reported the Lysholm score. However, only <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> provided exact scores through raw data. <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> gave the mean values and standard deviations. <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> presented the results in a histogram, <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> presented them in groups with cut points at 60 and 90.The Tegner score is presented by <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> and in <LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK>. VAS for pain and the SF-36 results are presented in <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> only. The Meyers score is presented by <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>. KOOS is given only by <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>Four trials also reported on a limited number of second-look arthroscopies, also providing results from biopsy of the repair tissue. <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> provided the ICRS score based on the morphology of the repair tissue and also the quality of the repair tissue after a biopsy retrieval (categorised into hyaline-like, mixed, fibrocartilage or fibrous tissue). <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> gave a more case-based narrative description of some biopsies and <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> provided a mean histology score based on different features of the histological components of structural repair.</P>

The authors reported that 22.7% (5.22) of the ACI and 31% (7/22) of the mosaicplasty allocated patients did not proceed to the operation due to spontaneous improvement after the first surgery and debridement of the defect area. Six of the patients allocated to the CCI arm of <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> did not have the intervention because of a negative ChondroCelect score that meant that the implant was not viable. <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> included these patients when presenting data on complications, but they did not include them in the results for treatment failure or for assessment of functional outcome using the KOOS score.

<P>The four comparisons tested by one or more of the six included trials are presented separately below. The three studies testing the same comparison (ACI versus mosaicplasty) were sufficiently dissimilar to merit separate descriptions. Only one, primarily exploratory, meta-analysis was performed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ACI versus mosaicplasty</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> found no statistically significant differences in functional assessment at one year using either the modified Cincinnati or Stanmore scores (Cincinnati score ("excellent" or "good" results): ACI 51/58 (88%) versus mosaicplasty 29/42 (69%), (reported P = 0.277)). However, our analysis found a statistically significant result for excellent and good results that favours ACI over mosaicplasty (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.59; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). A post-hoc subgroup analysis by defect site was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> to show a statistically significant difference in function in the ACI group at one year only for participants with lesions of the medial femoral condyle (Cincinnati score "excellent" or "good": ACI 21/24 (88%) versus mosaicplasty 21/29 (74%), reported P = 0.032). Cincinnati scores were not statistically significantly different in people with either lateral femoral condyle or patellar defects.</P>
<P>After one year follow-up, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grades of 1 (excellent) or 2 (good) assessed using arthroscopy were given to 30/37 (82%) after ACI and 8/23 (34%) after mosaicplasty; RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.17 (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In "50%" of participants of the ACI group, tissues were relatively soft on probing compared with the surrounding cartilage. Seven out of 19 participants who had biopsies after ACI at one year were found to have hyaline cartilage of normal appearance. The number of participants having biopsy after mosaicplasty was not stated and results were only reported for seven participants with a Cincinnati scale rating of "poor". In four of these participants, the plugs were <I>in situ</I> but the tissue between them had not become covered with continuous fibrous tissue; in three, the plugs had disintegrated; and in one participant, the area of the mosaicplasty had remained reasonably intact but the articular cartilage at the margins of the defect had broken down to expose subchondral bone. <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> shown an improvement of the quality of the repair tissue of an ACI patient between a biopsy taken at one and another at two years. This interesting finding suggests an ongoing maturation of the repair tissue over time.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> reported complications but did not mention whether any further surgery was required. Moreover, the authors did not split the complications by treatment group. In total, one participant developed calf-vein thrombosis and required anticoagulants and one developed a superficial infection. Three of the participants were slow to mobilise and required manipulation under anaesthesia; one of these required arthroscopy and arthrolysis to mobilise the knee.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> found statistically significant differences in Lysholm scores at six, 12 and 24 months favouring the mosaicplasty group (45.75 versus 53.45 at six months; 57.50 versus 68.25 at 12 months and 66.75 versus 72.70 at 24 months; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, results derived from the published raw data for this trial). It is notable that at 24 months postoperatively, 18 of the 20 ACI group participants and all of the 20 mosaicplasty group participants had a Lysholm score of 60 or more, which is considered the threshold for a 'good' result. The investigators found no significant difference between ACI and mosaicplasty for any time period when participants were assessed using the Tegner or the Meyers scores. The Tegner scores for ACI versus mosaicplasty were 1.55 versus 1.55 at three months, 2.95 versus 3.55 at six months, 4.25 versus 5.00 at 12 months and 5.10 versus 5.20 at 24 months (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The Meyers scores for ACI versus mosaicplasty were 8.50 versus 7.85 at three months, 12.05 versus 13.75 at six months, 14.15 versus 15.90 at 12 months and 15.90 versus 16.75 at 24 months (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The proportions of participants with complications reported in <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> were the same in both groups at 24 months (ACI 12/20 (60%) versus mosaicplasty 12/20 (60%)). In both groups, complications were either surgical (i.e. locking of the joint and adhesions) or non-surgical (i.e. passing irritation of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve) and variable in nature. Similar numbers of participants (8 versus 9) in the two groups had a subsequent surgical procedure, predominantly involving arthroscopy. However, most operations in the ACI group were to rectify longer term complications (range of timing of operations 2 to 24 months) whereas those in the mosaicplasty group generally occurred sooner after the operation (range 4 days to 22 months) and included treatment for haemarthrosis in two participants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> found no significant differences in overall functional assessment and clinical evaluation using the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (LKSS) and the Standard International Knee Documentation Committee Evaluation Form. The LKSS ratings were categorised as complete success (&gt; 90), partial success (60 to 90) or failure (&lt; 60). Fifteen of the 22 ACI-treated patients (68.2%) and 17 of the 22 mosaicplasty-treated patients (77.3%) had a Lysholm score of 60 or more. When combined with symptom disappearance to allow for a clearer comparison of the outcome in the two treatment arms, the percentage of complete success was 68.4% (13/19) for ACI versus 88.9% (16/18) for mosaicplasty (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.09; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

<P>Although outcome measurement differed in the three trials, and the categorisation of continuous scales into crude categories is generally unsatisfactory; two analyses featuring all three trials are presented on an exploratory basis. <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> presenting results for an 'excellent' outcome shows the disparity between the results of the three trials. <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> shows the pooled results for "satisfactory outcome of success". This is based on the "excellent and good results" retrieved from the Cincinnati score as presented by <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> and also by the "partial and complete success" as presented by <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> (patients with final Lysholm score of 60 or more with consecutive report of clinical improvement). Partial and complete success was derived from the raw data provided by <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> and was defined as a Lysholm score of 60 or more. The analysis revealed a non-significant result, with no preference to one treatment over the other (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), but also considerable heterogeneity (I² = 79%).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> found an improvement after both interventions (ACI and microfracture) at one, two and five years postoperatively. In both trial reports, the authors presented the majority of the results graphically, without giving the exact numbers. In <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>, the mean values could be extracted from the plots; these are given below. This was not possible for the five-year follow-up report (<LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors found that the two intervention groups did not differ significantly with regards to the Lysholm score and pain score, assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), at all follow-ups. Mean baseline Lysholm scores were similar in the two groups (ACI: 57.4 versus microfracture: 55.4), and improved in both groups at one year (ACI: 69.2 versus microfracture: 78) but not at two years (ACI: 70.8 versus microfracture: 75.4).</P>
<P>The Tegner score also showed no statistically significant difference between the groups in all time points. Based on the physical component of the Short Form-36 in the first two years, the microfracture group improved significantly more than the ACI group (reported P = 0.004). No such difference was found at five years follow-up (reported P = 0.054). The authors reported a significant improvement of SF-36 from baseline to five years for the microfracture group but not for the ACI group. However, the baseline scores were different (reported P = 0.05), which was not addressed in the analysis of the results. SF-36 physical scores changed from 41.1 (baseline) to 42.6 at one year and 42 at two years for the ACI group, and from 37.4 (baseline) to 42.9 and 46 at one and two years respectively in microfracture group (Analysis 5.10). No difference was detected two years postoperatively in the SF-36 mental health domain. In the microfracture group, patients who had lesions smaller that 4 cm² were reported to have had significantly better clinical results (according to the Lysholm score, VAS and SF-36) than those with a bigger defect (P &lt; 0.003). Such an association was not apparent in the ACI group.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Arthroscopy conducted two years after surgery did not show any difference between the ACI and microfracture groups using the ICRS grading system; the findings were graded as "nearly normal" in both groups. Of the 67 biopsies obtained, the difference in presence of some hyaline cartilage between the two groups was not statistically significant (16/32 versus 10/35; RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.28; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two years postoperatively, there were two "failures" (5%) in the ACI group and one (3%) in the microfracture group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> defined a failure as requiring "a re-operation because of symptoms due to a lack of healing of the primary treated defect. The need for shaving or trimming a lesion was not defined as a failure.&#8221; These participants received another cartilage treatment and were excluded from further follow-up. Further arthroscopic surgery for trimming and shaving was needed in 10 cases in the ACI group (25%) and four (10%) in the microfracture group. In ACI participants, shaving was usually required for symptomatic tissue hypertrophy. Among microfracture participants, one participant had adhesions needing manipulation and operative release, and three had minor debridement. No serious complications, such as deep infections or thromboembolic events, were reported. Five years after the surgery, the authors report nine failures, including one total knee replacement, in each treatment group (<LINK REF="REF-Knutsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutsen 2007</LINK>) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> found that while participants in both groups had better Lysholm, Tegner and patient ICRS scores than at baseline, the improvements were greater for the MACI group and had persisted at 24 months follow-up. Differences between the two groups in the mean Lysholm scores were not statistically significant at six (87 versus 82) or 12 months (92 versus 82) but were significant at 24 months, reflecting a decline in the scores of the microfracture group (92 versus 69; MD 23.00, 95% CI 9.49 to 36.51; see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

<P>A similar pattern was apparent for level of activities as measured by Tegner score.

<LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> did not show a significant difference (either statistical or clinical) between the two treatments in the "overall" KOOS (Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) scores at six, 12 or 18 months (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Some caution should be exercised in interpreting these results as the authors elected to exclude one of the five components of the KOOS score (the 'sports' domain) due to inadequate data. Additionally, the data for six participants of the CCI group who (due to low score of chondrogenic potential) did not receive allocated treatment and those for two protocol violations in the microfracture group were not included. In the 36 months follow-up the authors presented the mean improvement from baseline. Sports domain data of KOOS were also reported at 36 months but still not included in the overall KOOS scores. The mean improvement from baseline in overall KOOS at 36 months was greater with CCI compared with microfracture but did not reach statistical significance (MD 5.42, 95% CI -4.39 to 15.23, see <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>. Note that there are discrepancies in the numbers available at follow-up for this outcome. Based on a 'mixed linear model approach', with time as a categorical variable, the mean improvement from baseline results become statistically significant (MD 7.66, 95% CI 0.16 to 15.15; see <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). The better KOOS results for MACI were reflected in improvements over all five KOOS domains (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). In their 2009 publication, <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> found that, based on six monthly assessment intervals, the KOOS scores from baseline in the MACI group continued to improve over time, whereas those in the microfracture group did not, appearing to plateau or decline after 18 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> conducted post-hoc subgroup analyses of the overall KOOS scores at 36 months follow-up based on time since onset of symptoms, with results presented for two subgroups of participants with symptoms onset before two years and before three years respectively.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> reported fewer treatment failures, who had subsequently undergone re-intervention, at 36 months in the CCI group but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (2/51 versus 7/61, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.57; see <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). Moreover, this does not include the six CCI participants who did not receive treatment and who thus can be considered treatment failures also for this group.</P>
<P>At 18 months, the numbers of participants reporting adverse events, both overall (CCI: 50/57 (88%) versus MF: 50/61 (82%)) and those considered related to the study procedures (CCI: 38/57 (67%) versus MF: 36/61 (61%)) were similar in the two groups. Seven of the CCI participants (12%) and eight of the microfracture participants (13%) reported serious adverse events, while five (9%) and eight (13%), respectively, were considered related to the allocated surgery. However, no criteria were given for the determination of serious adverse events. Two adverse events considered related to the study procedure that required hospitalisation occurred in the CCI group. These were one case of deep vein thrombosis occurring 19 days after surgery and one case of severe tendinitis of the fascia lata occurring approximately 18 months after surgery. The data for overall and some individual treatment-related adverse events at 18 months are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>; and at 36 months in <LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>. In both treatment groups, arthralgia (joint pain) was the most commonly reported adverse event, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.44 at 18 months and RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.51 at 36 months). More participants in the CCI group experienced joint swelling occurring within 14 days postoperatively (RR 3.92, 95% CI 1.15 to 13.35: <I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>), but difference between the two groups in joint swelling was not statistically significant at 36 months.

<P>This review included data from six trials, involving a total of 442 participants, comparing ACI with a number of different procedures such as mosaicplasty and microfracture. The heterogeneity of the trials, especially in the interventions compared and outcomes, precluded pooling, except on an exploratory basis. Hence, there is very limited evidence available on which to judge the effectiveness of ACI for treating full thickness articular cartilage defects of the knee.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">ACI versus mosaicplasty</HEADING>
<P>The three trials for this comparison reported contradictory findings for functional outcome. While <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> found the statistically significant results in favour of ACI for people with 'excellent' or 'good' modified Cincinnati scores, the analysis of Lysholm score data provided for <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> found in favour of the mosaicplasty group. However, there was no significant difference between groups in the numbers of participants with a good outcome nor was there in functional outcome measured using the Meyers or Tegner scores. <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> found no statistically significant differences between the two groups for functional outcomes. Pooled data from measures of "satisfactory outcome" demonstrate this variation in the results of the three trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> reported statistically significant results in favour of ACI based on ICRS grades of "good" or "excellent" following arthroscopy at one year. However, only 30% of the total number of randomised participants received arthroscopy and the lack of blinding also increases the risk of bias in these findings.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> failed to indicate the treatment group of the five participants with complications, one of which required arthroscopy. Sixty per cent of participants in both groups had a variety of complications in <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>, whereas no adverse events were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK>.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> reported no significant differences between the two groups in function measured via the Lysholm and Tegner scores or in pain at follow-up. The difference in favour of the microfracture group in SF-36 physical domain results at two-year follow-up was reported as not statistically significant at five years. Similar numbers in both groups were deemed 'failures' at two and five years. Arthroscopic examination at two years yielded "nearly normal" findings for both groups.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-18 14:15:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The heterogeneity of the available evidence has been referred to above. In addition, there was a reduction in the available evidence resulting from loss to follow-up, non-participation in subsequent invasive procedures, such as biopsies, and post-randomisation exclusions. There is also potential loss of evidence from unreported trials. As we mentioned in the <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>, nine trials could not be traced so far. Seven of these were identified in a Health Technology Assessment systematic review in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Jobanputra-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobanputra 2001</LINK>) but still could not be traced. According to their protocols, most of these studies would be included in this review and thus provide important evidence to judge the effectiveness of ACI over other treatments. However, it seems that these trials were either abandoned due to organising or participating issues or the results were never published, suggesting a publication bias.</P>
<P>The favourable findings of small, single-centre trials should be considered provisional and requiring confirmation from other larger, and preferably multi-centre trials. However, some noteworthy points arise still from the individual trials in terms of applicability. For instance, it should be noted that <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> did not use fibrin glue for the watertight seal of the periosteal patch, which was against the recommendations of the inventors of the technique (<LINK REF="REF-Brittberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittberg 1994</LINK>). However, there is no evidence to attribute the slightly inferior results of the ACI group to cell leakage; and studies would be needed to evaluate the need, if any, of the extra procedure.</P>
<P>Based on post-hoc subgroup analysis, the trials provided some preliminary evidence that the location and size of the defect may be important. <LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> found more favourable results for ACI in participants with medial condylar defects. <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> found that the microfracture technique had poorer results in lesions over 4 cm². This finding was consistent with the results of <LINK REF="STD-Gudas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gudas 2005</LINK> who reduced this size limit to 2 cm². It seems that there is evidence to support the suggestion that small lesions may heal spontaneously or after bone marrow-stimulating procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Steadman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steadman 2003</LINK>). The small size of cartilage lesions in <LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK> may explain the high rate of spontaneous improvement and high rate of symptom relief (and withdrawal from the study) after the first surgery and debridement of the chondral lesion. There is evidence to support that a more clear distribution of indications of each of the cartilage lesion treatments should be performed. The results given above should be further investigated and confirmed with additional studies so to potentially conclude in defining specific indications. However, it is important to note the tentative nature of these findings so far, which should also be set in the context of the basic question examined in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> showed a continuous improvement after 18 months, up to at least 36 months, although the microfracture group reached a plateau in terms of clinical function after 18 months. In <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>, the Lysholm score similarly declined for the microfracture group between 12 and 24 months; the MACI group shown a stable score after 12 months. Those two studies may provide evidence for a more stable and long standing outcome after ACI compared with microfracture; the latter may not provide sufficiently high quality repair tissue that can resists wear and tear over time. The finding is also compatible with the suggestion of that hyaline cartilage may mature even 1.5 or 2 years after the surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brun-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on post-hoc and inadequately reported subgroup analyses involving an unspecified number of participants, <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> reported significantly better improvement in overall KOOS results at 36 months follow-up for CCI patients whose onset of symptoms was less than three years before treatment. Notably, similar findings for the subgroup of patients whose onset of symptoms was less than two years did not reach statistical significance. The dangers of subgroup analyses are rife (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2010</LINK>) and it is essential that the claims in <LINK REF="REF-Saris-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saris 2009</LINK> of a time to treatment effect are not taken as proven. Another issue that is still questioned and needs to be clarified is the potential effect of previously performed subchondral bone surgeries on the outcome after an ACI treatment. Although the outcomes were not systematically reported, MRI evaluation in <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK> revealed a "subchondral bone reaction" in both CCI and microfracture groups. However the microfracture treated patients developed more subchondral bone reaction with more extended elevation of the subchondral bone, 36 months postoperatively. No clinical association was searched by the authors. This finding is compatible with others showing that ACI treated patients that had a previous history of microfracture of the lesion, had a higher incidence of intralesional osteophytes in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010a</LINK>). Cohort studies have also suggested that there was a negative clinical effect on patients treated with ACI, when they had previously treated with microfracture (<LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minas 2009</LINK>). Thus along with the time of surgery, history of previous surgery may also play an additional role for the success of the ACI treatment. More studies are needed to confirm or reject those suggestions.</P>
<P>Most of the included trials failed to present the adverse effects or failures of the interventions. Where evidence is available, ACI seems to result in a similar incidence of adverse events and failures to other methods but the information given is too limited to confirm this.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK> provided some evidence showing that there is an ongoing maturation of the repair tissue even two years postoperatively after ACI; and <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK> found a greater tendency for hyaline cartilage after ACI at two years. There are studies to show that the potential of the repair tissue after any cartilage treatment may change over time due to subsequent maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2003</LINK>). Studies have also shown that after microfracture, patients' knees may deteriorate over time due to failure of the repair tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Kreuz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreuz 2006</LINK>). Thus, there are questions regarding the adequate timing for biopsies, if strictly necessary, for the evaluation of the treatment outcome and for the longest follow-up time which is appropriate for assessing the final outcome of the treatment. The findings of similar numbers of people in the two treatment groups with 'treatment failure', including one in each group having undergone total knee replacement at five years follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 2004</LINK>, show the importance of longer-term follow-up.</P>
<P>Notably, there are limitations of the biopsy as an evaluation tool for the assessment of the effectiveness of a cartilage treatment therapy. There is no evidence that a biopsy cylinder that is histologically proved to consist of hyaline tissue mechanically behaves as normal cartilage. Another issue is whether a small cylinder taken from the repair tissue can predict the consistency, integration and mechanical behaviour of the entire lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010a</LINK>). It is also questionable whether it is ethically correct to sacrifice a part of the repair tissue in order to assess its quality. Even if the retrieved tissue is relatively small, it may affect the patient's clinical status in the future. This concern, and the reluctance of asymptomatic participants to provide consent for biopsy at one year, formed the basis for a change in protocol in <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> to the non-collection of these samples.</P>
<P>There is a notable heterogeneity among the studies comparing an ACI technique with other treatments. Among the six studies, there were four different ACI techniques evaluated (ACI-P, ACI-C, MACI, CCI) which were compared with two different interventions (mosaicplasty and microfracture). Besides that, there were several outcomes assessed and questionnaires were often presented in different ways (values or groups of values). Therefore there was a limited opportunity for pooling and to present a meta-analysis of the outcomes. As a result, the amount of information is not adequate to draw a safe conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the ACI over other treatments.</P>
<P>This is a request then for more homogenous studies in the future. However, it seems that the launching of new materials in the market makes the interventions even more heterogeneous. In the seven ongoing studies, there are seven different comparisons (<I>see</I> the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). There are also three products to be compared for the first time in a RCT, and all of them will be compared with microfracture. The only way to produce a valuable conclusion regarding the superiority or not of ACI, would be the pooling of all ACI techniques or at least of the third generation ACI techniques. Another interesting finding is that four of the ongoing studies are industrially sponsored (<LINK REF="STD-Barnouin" TYPE="STUDY">Barnouin</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crawford" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth_x002d_Ben-Arie" TYPE="STUDY">Roth-Ben Arie</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUMMIT" TYPE="STUDY">SUMMIT</LINK>); all four studies compare a specific product of the sponsoring company with microfracture.</P>

A high risk of selection bias resulting from compromised randomisation methods was evident in the earlier reports for <LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK> due to post-randomisation exclusions; although these were not mentioned in full report of this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Basad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basad 2010</LINK>), we consider this is still of concern. <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK>, which was quasi-randomised, was also judged at high risk of selection bias. While assessor blinding, where done, was limited to the examination of biopsy findings, it should be noted that outcome was mainly assessed using patient-derived scores. Patients could not be blinded due to different incisions of ACI treatment and microfractures (only scars from arthroscopy apparent) or mosaicplasty (lack of scar for periosteal retrieval).</P>
<P>An important flaw of the studies is the large proportion of missing data and also the failure to address incomplete outcome data. In all but one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dozin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dozin 2005</LINK>), details on the outcomes from patients who deviated from the study protocol or were lost to clinical follow-up were not reported. That was even more obvious for the arthroscopic evaluation and biopsies as an outcome (in four studies). Except in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>) there was not an organised recruitment of the participants. Only a limited number of the patients were biopsied and there was no reference to any criteria for this. Therefore, the validity of finding for this outcome should be considered doubtful. There was evidence of selective reporting in most of the studies and also some potential for other bias. At least in two of the trials, industrial sponsorship was involved (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saris 2008</LINK>); both favoured the ACI intervention.</P>
<P>Given the above, we can conclude that the evidence provided is of relatively limited validity.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-06-16 17:07:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The comprehensive search undertaken, including for ongoing trials, and the return to trial authors for further details of their studies should have helped reduce publication and reporting biases. One of the authors (HV) is undertaking clinical and basic research in ACI. However, as the review process was carried out independently by two investigators, it is unlikely that this would introduce bias in the review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-12 20:16:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are three recently published systematic reviews addressing RCTs examining the use of autologous chondrocyte implantation for treating articular cartilage knee defects (<LINK REF="REF-Bekkers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekkers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vavken-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vavken 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bekkers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekkers 2009</LINK> includes four RCTs that compared ACI versus microfracture or mosaicplasty. <LINK REF="REF-Bekkers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekkers 2009</LINK> is partly focused on possible selection criteria for the treatment selection of full thickness cartilage lesions of the knee. However, the limited number of published high quality, level one, relevant studies does not allow for safe conclusions. <LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010b</LINK> is a systematic review based on this one, thus following the Cochrane methodology; it also includes three studies that compared different ACI techniques. <LINK REF="REF-Vavken-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vavken 2010</LINK> included also studies comparing ACI versus any other treatment and also comparisons between different ACI techniques. In <LINK REF="REF-Vavken-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vavken 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Horas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horas 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Horas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Horas 2003</LINK> were assessed as individual studies, thus overestimating the outcomes of this study (<LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2010d</LINK>). This systematic review also concluded that there is much inconsistency in methodological quality and findings among the included studies which precludes drawing. All the above mentioned systematic reviews agree with our main findings.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2010</LINK> included 13 studies of Level I or II evidence (i.e. additionally included prospective cohort studies ), comparing ACI with microfracture or mosaicplasty with other ACI techniques (2nd or 3rd generation ACI). The authors also concluded that additional high quality studies are needed to draw safe conclusions regarding any superiority of ACI.</P>
<P>Another older systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Ruano_x002d_Ravina-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruano-Ravina 2006</LINK>) included three RCTs and nine case series comparing ACI to other treatment. The authors concluded that available data afforded no evidence that ACI is more effective than other conventional techniques in treating chondral lesions of the knee. Another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Clar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clar 2005</LINK>), which included four RCTs as well as observational studies, also suggested that "there is insufficient evidence at present to say that ACI is cost-effective compared with microfracture or mosaicplasty. Longer term outcomes are required". The authors suggested that "Economic modelling using some assumptions about long-term outcomes that seem reasonable suggests that ACI would be cost-effective because it is more likely to produce hyaline cartilage, which is more likely to be durable and to prevent osteoarthritis in the longer term (e.g. 20 years)". Currently there is no evidence to confirm this hypothesis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-17 13:43:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from the six trials included in this review to conclude whether autologous cartilage implantation is superior to other treatment strategies for treating full thickness articular cartilage defects in the knee.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-01 13:41:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the use of ACI and other chondral resurfacing techniques is becoming increasingly widespread, there is a strong case for further randomised trials of high methodological rigour and long-term follow-up of functional outcomes in order to determine the effectiveness of ACI for participants with knee defects. Specifically, more information and research is needed to compare chondrocyte techniques with conservative treatment such as intensive physiotherapy. Further information is needed on the relationship between clinical, histological and radiological outcomes, and the most appropriate measure of functional outcomes that relate to a generic measure of health-related quality of life. The regular updating of this review is also required as new evidence becomes available.</P>

<P>Patient characteristics do not meet the inclusion criteria. The study was a RCT comparing an ACI-based treatment (cultivated autologous chondrocytes in a 3-dimensional carrier&#8211;fibrin glue) with abrasive techniques. However, this trial included a large variety of patients; 20% of the participants presented with double cartilage lesions, 10% with tibia plateau lesions, 20% requiring ACL reconstruction, 46% with partial meniscectomies and 12% meniscal suturing.
