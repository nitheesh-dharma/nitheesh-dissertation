<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-05 15:48:00 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the primary way that children become infected with HIV. More than 2000 children worldwide are infected in this way every day. Researchers theorized that disinfecting the vaginal area of HIV-infected pregnant women would make it less likely that their babies would be born with HIV. The primary objective of this review of clinical and randomised studies is to estimate the effect of vaginal disinfection during labour on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection in HIV infected women. The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of vaginal disinfection on infant and maternal mortality and morbidity, and to describe its side effects to the mother and the new baby.</P>
<P>The authors of this review found that currently, there is no evidence of an effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV. Given its simplicity and low cost, there is need for a large well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trial to assess the additive effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV in pregnant, HIV-infected women, who are on antiretroviral therapy.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection is one of the most tragic consequences of the HIV epidemic, especially in resource-limited countries, resulting in about 650 000 new paediatric HIV infections each year worldwide. The paediatric HIV epidemic threatens to seriously undermine decade-old child survival programmes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To estimate the effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV and infant and maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as tolerability of vaginal disinfection in HIV-infected women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Register, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, LILACS, AIDSTRIALS, and AIDSDRUGS, using standardised methodological filters for identifying trials. We also searched reference lists of identified articles, relevant editorials, expert opinions and letters to journal editors, and abstracts and proceedings of relevant conferences, and contacted subject experts and pharmaceutical companies. There were no language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials or clinical trials comparing vaginal disinfection during labour with placebo or no treatment, in known HIV-infected pregnant women. Trials had to include an estimate of the effect of vaginal disinfection on MTCT of HIV and or infant and maternal mortality and morbidity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Meta-analysis was performed using the Yusuf-Peto modification of Mantel-Haenszel's fixed effect method.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only two trials that included 708 patients met the inclusion criteria. The effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.33), neonatal death (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.30 to 6.33), and death after the neonatal period (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.45) is uncertain. There was no evidence that vaginal disinfection increased adverse effects in mothers (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.22), and evidence from one trial showed that adverse effects decreased in neonates (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Currently, there is no evidence of an effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV. Given its simplicity and low cost, there is need for a large well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trial to assess the additive effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV in antiretroviral treated women.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization estimate that about 7 million children 0-14 years of age had been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during the past two decades; 2.7 million of whom are still living with the virus (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2001</LINK>). These children will have acquired the infection primarily through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). HIV infection in women of childbearing age continues to fuel the paediatric HIV epidemic. An estimated 3 million HIV-infected women give birth worldwide yearly, resulting in 1800 new paediatric infections each day, 90% of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of MTCT of HIV ranges from 15-30% in the industrialised countries of Europe and North America, to 30-45% in the breastfeeding populations of sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-De-Cock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Cock 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Childhood illness and death resulting from HIV infection may seriously undermine successful child survival programmes, which have been promoted and supported by the international community over the years. This, together with the rising cost of comprehensive health care to treat HIV infection and AIDS has led to the development of numerous strategies to prevent MTCT of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-De-Cock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Cock 2000</LINK>). The strategies, which have been researched over the last decade, include antiretroviral therapy, Caesarean section delivery, and avoidance of breastfeeding. </P>
<P>In 1994, it was demonstrated that administration of zidovudine (an antiretroviral drug) to the mother during pregnancy and to the infant for the first six weeks after birth reduced transmission by two-thirds (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 1994</LINK>). In the well-resourced countries of Europe and North America, incorporation of this or more complex and expensive antiretroviral regimens to clinical practice coupled with Caesarean delivery and avoidance of breastfeeding has reduced the rate of MTCT of HIV to less than 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MTCT-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MTCT Group 1999</LINK>). Despite their benefits, the costs associated with these interventions, their complexity, and the need for skilled personnel limit their availability in under-resourced developing countries, where most of the MTCT of HIV takes place. Recently, high quality randomised controlled trials have shown several simpler and less expensive antiretroviral regimens to be effective in decreasing MTCT of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2004</LINK>). However, even short-course antiretroviral drugs may not be affordable or may be logistically difficult to deliver in many developing countries. One other major problem in these poorer areas of the world with the highest burden of MTCT of HIV is that the majority of infected women are not aware of their HIV infection status. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions that could potentially be implemented in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes would be valuable. </P>
<P>In the absence of breastfeeding, most infant HIV infections (70%) occur during labour and delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertolli-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertolli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertolli-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertolli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mock--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mock 1999</LINK>). In addition, studies of twins indicate that the first-born infants have a risk of infection at least twice that of the second-born infant (<LINK REF="REF-Goedert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duliege-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duliege 1995</LINK>). These observational data suggest that vaginal exposure might be an important route of infection; a hypothesis supported by the protective effect of Caesarean delivery (<LINK REF="REF-MOD-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MOD 1999</LINK>). Consequently, disinfection of the birth canal during labour has been proposed as a low-cost strategy for reducing MTCT of HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 2000</LINK>). Chlorhexidine is one such disinfectant. It is a powerful mucous membrane disinfectant that neutralises HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Harbison-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbison 1989</LINK>) and is generally well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Burman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1996</LINK>). However, side effects have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Autegarden-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Autegarden 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pham 2000</LINK>). These include dermatological hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic shock. Benzalkonium chloride, another potential candidate for vaginal disinfection, inactivates HIV in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Wainberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wainberg 1990</LINK>), is not absorbed by mucosae and has been shown to be well tolerated when used as a spermicide (<LINK REF="REF-Erny-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erny 1983</LINK>). This review aims to combine all randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials comparing vaginal disinfection conducted to date, with an appropriate control group, to estimate the effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection and infant and maternal mortality and morbidity. Although the key to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is primary prevention of HIV infection in women, prevention of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her child requires as much attention. The ultimate goal of this review is to determine whether vaginal disinfection during labour could be recommended as a public health policy to reduce MTCT of HIV infection and, as such, we have considered overall HIV infection in the child without differentiating between prepartum, intrapartum, and early postpartum infection. </P>
<P>The review is one of a group of reviews assessing the available evidence for preventing HIV transmission from an infected mother to her child. Other topics include antiretroviral therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2004</LINK>), vitamin A supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2004</LINK>), delivery by Caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Read-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 2004</LINK>), and avoidance of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Tholandi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tholandi 2004</LINK>).</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Electronic searches were undertaken in CENTRAL/CCTR (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth register, PubMed (2001 onwards), EMBASE, AIDSLINE, LILACS, AIDSTRIALS, AIDSDRUGS, using the following terms: (benzalkonium OR betadine OR chlorhexidine OR "vaginal antisept*-creams-foams-gel-jellies-OR-tablet*" OR "vaginal cleansing-disinfection-OR-wash") AND (pregnancy OR labour OR labor OR birth OR intrapartum OR delivery). Standardised methodological filters for identifying controlled trials were applied (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), as appropriate. The methodological filter we used for PubMed was ("randomized controlled trial" [pt] OR "controlled clinical trial" [pt] OR "randomized controlled trials" [mh] OR "random allocation" [mh] OR "double-blind method" [mh] OR "single-blind method" [mh] OR "clinical trial" [pt] OR "clinical trials" [mh] OR (clinica* [tw] AND trial* [tw]) OR ((singl* [tw] OR doubl* [tw] OR trebl* [tw] OR tripl* [tw]) AND (mask* [tw] OR blind* [tw])) OR (latin [tw] AND square [tw]) OR placebos [mh] OR placebo* [tw] OR random* [tw] OR volunteer* [tw] OR "research design" [mh:noexp]) NOT (animal [mh] NOT human [mh]), and that for EMBASE was (CLINICAL-TRIAL (DE) OR RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL (DE) OR trial* OR compar* OR DOUBLE-BLIND-PROCEDURE (DE) OR PLACEBO (DE) OR versus OR MULTICENTER-STUDY (DE) OR assign* OR allocat* OR singl* adj blind* OR CROSS-OVER-PROCEDURE (DE) OR PHASE-3-CLINICAL-TRIAL (DE) OR INTERMETHOD-COMPARISON (DE) OR volunteer* OR SINGLE-BLIND-PROCEDURE (DE)). The "Related articles" feature of PubMed was also used.</P>
<P>The above search strategy was supplemented by searching reference lists of identified articles and abstracts or proceedings of the International Conference on AIDS, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, and the Conference on Global Strategies for the Prevention of HIV Transmission From Mothers to Infants. Investigators of identified trials and other content experts, agencies, organisations, academic centres, and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to locate any further trials (completed or ongoing, published or not) that may not have been included in the electronic databases or presented at the conferences. Relevant editorials, expert opinions and letters to the editor were also scrutinised for any additional relevant studies or unpublished data. There were no language restrictions to our search.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Five authors undertook the review. CSW conducted the literature search, noting the date each database was searched and years covered by the search, MSS cross-checked the search, and JDS, JACS and PB were informed of its progress. </P>
<P>Studies identified by the search strategy were scrutinised independently for eligibility by three authors (CSW, MSS, PB). Studies were included if they were controlled trials (study design) comparing vaginal disinfection during labour with placebo or no treatment (intervention) in HIV infected women (participants) and information was available on any of the outcomes listed above. CSW, MSS and PB then independently assessed included studies for methodological quality. Quality assessment was based on the method of assigning participants to interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) as follows: </P>
<P>Category A - Adequate allocation concealment (such as centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation; pre-numbered or coded identical containers administered serially to patients; on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered; sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>Category B - Uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, merely stating that a list or table was used, that sealed envelopes were used, or that the participants were randomly assigned); and</P>
<P>Category C - Inadequate allocation concealment: if the approach used was alternation; use of case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week, open list of random numbers, etc.<BR/> <BR/>After quality assessment, the three authors extracted the data. We designed forms for data extraction and for requesting additional information from the investigators. On data abstraction forms was noted the review title, study reference and publication status, date of extraction, and review author's initials. Data were extracted under the following subheadings in the form: methods (method of randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding of those receiving and providing care and outcome assessors, losses to follow-up and how they were handled), participants (setting, number of women randomised), interventions (disinfectant, dose, type of control group, co-interventions), outcomes, and (other) notes. If data were available on MTCT of HIV at two or more periods, the more complete or later one was taken into account. All the outcome variables are dichotomous and the data extracted were the number of affected participants and the number of participants in the comparison group. </P>
<P>Disagreement between CSW, MSS and PB on the eligibility or quality of a trial or data extracted was resolved by discussion. If a disagreement were to persist, JDS and JACS would have arbitrated. We planned to reference any study that satisfied the design, intervention and participant criteria but for which none of the pre-specified outcomes could be obtained as one awaiting assessment. When we obtain the required information, such a trial would be included in the next update of the review. Authors assessing study eligibility and quality were not blinded to the names of the authors, their institutions, journals of publication, and results of the study. </P>
<P>We undertook statistical analysis using RevMan 4.2, expressed study results as odd ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and combined them using the Yusuf-Peto modification of Mantel-Haenszel's fixed effect method (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). We examined heterogeneity between studies by graphical inspection of results followed by a chi-square test of homogeneity, and would have used meta-regression to explore the effect of trial quality, type of disinfectant, administered dose, method of administration, and type of control group, on estimated treatment effects if there were at least five trials included in the review. No subgroup analyses based on patient characteristics were planned, a priori, as these are better investigated using individual patient-data meta-analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gaillard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gaillard 2001</LINK>
<BR/>Eight hundred and ninety eight HIV-infected women in labour in a government hospital in Mombasa, Kenya, were allocated to intervention in alternating weeks. A regime of nine days of vaginal lavage followed by five days of non-lavage was introduced early on in the trial. This was followed by a regime of four days of vaginal lavage and 10 days of non-lavage at the end of the recruitment period. Women were allocated to the intervention in clusters, but analysed as individuals. Women who delivered within one hour of admission were excluded from the analysis. Also excluded from the analysis were women in whom the time between first lavage and delivery was less than one hour, and those for whom the time between the last lavage and delivery was more than four hours. </P>

<BR/>A simple randomised trial in which 108 HIV-infected pregnant women in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) and Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) were allocated to treatment strategies using a computer-generated system by block-randomisation with a block size of 10. Sequentially numbered identical sealed packages containing the treatments were prepared by an independent central pharmacy according to the randomisation list. Women self-administered either one percent benzalkonium chloride or placebo vaginal capsules daily from 36 weeks of pregnancy until labour. Another vaginal capsule was administered at the beginning of the delivery process in the maternity ward under supervision of the study team. Finally, the neonate was bathed in either a one percent solution of benzalkonium chloride or placebo within 30 minutes of delivery, in the delivery room. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The study was designed as a phase II trial to observe a four-fold increase of genital ulcers from 5% in the placebo group to 20% in the treatment group, with an alpha error of 0.1 and 80% power. Therefore, it did not have adequate power to demonstrate a clinically significant difference in the risk of MTCT of HIV between the benzalkonium chloride and placebo arms.</P>

<BR/>Alternation, which is the approach to allocation concealment used in this study, is considered inadequate by standard Cochrane criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). The study is, thus, of low quality. </P>

<BR/>The method of assigning participants to treatment strategies that is, a computer-generated list and sequentially numbered, identical sealed drug containers prepared by a central pharmacy is considered adequate by standard Cochrane criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Only two small trials that included 708 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials (p = 0.94). Combining the two trials show that the effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV (odds ratio [OR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 1.33), neonatal death (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.30 to 6.33), and death after the neonatal period (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.45) is uncertain. There was no evidence that vaginal disinfection increased adverse effects in mothers (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.22), and evidence from one trial showed that adverse effects decreased in neonates (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We found no evidence of an effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV infection and infant mortality. However, the scarcity of randomised controlled trials that evaluate the effect of vaginal disinfection during labour on the risk of MTCT of HIV means that the database has limitations. The two included trials had only 78% power to detect a 30% reduction in the risk of MTCT of HIV, and less than 10% power to detect a significant effect of the order observed (that is, 6% reduction in the risk of MTCT of HIV), from a baseline transmission rate of 30%. Given the magnitude of the paediatric HIV epidemic in under-resourced countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2001</LINK>), the suggestion that vaginal exposure might increase the risk of MTCT of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Goedert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duliege-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duliege 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MOD-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MOD 1999</LINK>), and the need for effective, cheap, safe, and easy interventions to be used alone or in association with a short course of antiretroviral therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2004</LINK>), there is need for high quality randomised controlled trials to investigate the effect of vaginal disinfection on MTCT of HIV; or more likely, the additive effect of vaginal disinfection in antiretroviral treated women.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At the moment, there is no high-quality evidence to use vaginal disinfection to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the simplicity and low cost of vaginal disinfection, there is a need for a large high-quality randomised controlled trial to assess the additive effect of this intervention on the risk of MTCT of HIV in antiretroviral treated women.</P>
