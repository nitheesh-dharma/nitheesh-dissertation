<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the effect of feed thickener on gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in babies up to six months of age.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux is a common condition in babies. It occurs when the stomach contents (milk feeds and acid) come back up into the gullet or mouth. While this normally improves as babies grow older, it can sometimes become troublesome and treatment may be needed. Thickening the milk feeds is a simple method that is commonly used to treat GOR. However, it is unclear if using feed thickeners improves GOR.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the research published up to 22 November 2016. We found 8 clinical trials recruiting 637 babies up to 6 months of age who presented with symptoms of GOR. The recruited babies were mainly 'healthy' term babies (i.e. babies born within three weeks of the due date) who were bottle feeding. Three of the studies were funded by a pharmaceutical company, hence the quality of the evidence presented must be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that term babies with GOR given feed thickeners had nearly two fewer reflux episodes per day. Babies with GOR were also 2.5 times more likely to have no reflux symptoms if feed thickeners were used. No studies reported information on failure to thrive (i.e. poor growth). We found that babies with GOR given feed thickeners showed an improvement in an important measure of acid reflux obtained from pH study. Reflux index (i.e. percentage of time of acidic reflux of pH &lt; 4) was 5% lower in babies given feed thickeners. No major harms were reported in the eight studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Due to study design limitations, we are moderately confident in the evidence for the reduction of two reflux episodes per day. Hence, feed thickeners can be useful in term babies who are bottle feeding and have troublesome GOR.</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence for the other outcomes as low due to the small number of studies with small numbers of babies recruited. Further research is needed to determine which type of feed thickener is better and whether feed thickeners are useful in babies with GOR who are breastfeeding or preterm.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-26 00:40:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is common in infants, and feed thickeners are often used to manage it in infants as they are simple to use and perceived to be harmless. However, conflicting evidence exists to support the use of feed thickeners.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-11-27 09:44:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the use of feed thickeners in infants up to six months of age with GOR in terms of reduction in a) signs and symptoms of GOR, b) reflux episodes on pH probe monitoring or intraluminal impedance or a combination of both, or c) histological evidence of oesophagitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-26 19:55:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 22 November 2016), Embase (1980 to 22 November 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 22 November 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials<B>.</B>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-10-26 00:46:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials if they examined the effects of feed thickeners as compared to unthickened feeds (no treatment or placebo) in treating GOR in term infants up to six months of age or six months of corrected gestational age for those born preterm.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-10-26 00:48:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently identified eligible studies from the literature search. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and quality assessments of the eligible studies. Differences in opinion were resolved by discussion with a third review author, and consensus was reached among all three review authors. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-29 02:06:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials recruiting a total of 637 infants met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The infants included in the review were mainly formula-fed term infants. The trials were of variable methodological quality. Formula-fed term infants with GOR on feed thickeners had nearly two fewer episodes of regurgitation per day (mean difference -1.97 episodes per day, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.32 to -1.61; 6 studies, 442 infants, moderate-certainty evidence) and were 2.5 times more likely to be asymptomatic from regurgitation at the end of the intervention period (risk ratio 2.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 4.51; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 5, 95% CI 4 to 13; 2 studies, 186 infants, low-certainty evidence) when compared to infants with GOR on unthickened feeds. No studies reported failure to thrive as an outcome. We found low-certainty evidence based on 2 studies recruiting 116 infants that use of feed thickeners improved the oesophageal pH probe parameters of reflux index (i.e. percentage of time pH &lt; 4), number of reflux episodes lasting longer than 5 minutes, and duration of longest reflux episode. No major side effects were reported with the use of feed thickeners. Information was insufficient to conclude which type of feed thickener is superior.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-29 01:54:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux is a physiological self resolving phenomenon in infants that does not necessarily require any treatment. However, we found moderate-certainty evidence that feed thickeners should be considered if regurgitation symptoms persist in term bottle-fed infants. The reduction of two episodes of regurgitation per day is likely to be of clinical significance to caregivers. Due to the limited information available, we were unable to assess the use of feed thickeners in infants who are breastfeeding or preterm nor could we conclude which type of feed thickener is superior.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-27 09:45:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is an involuntary retrograde movement of gastric content into the oesophagus with or without regurgitation (<LINK REF="REF-Falconer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falconer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). This is a normal physiological, self limiting occurrence in healthy infants causing little or no symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). Prevalence of regurgitation or GOR in infants peaks at 4 months of age, with 50% to 85% of infants reported to have regurgitation at least once a day (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transient inappropriate relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter is the main mechanism leading to GOR in most age groups (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>). This was found to occur in preterm infants as early as 26 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Omari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omari 2002</LINK>). Pharyngeal stimulation, gastric distension, and raised intra-abdominal pressure were found to trigger the relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. The role of delayed gastric emptying, another potential mechanism, on the pathophysiology of GOR is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omari 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>With increasing frequency and severity, GOR eventually becomes pathological, although this differentiation is difficult to define. The joint recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) defined gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) as reflux of gastric contents causing troublesome symptoms or complication, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). The definition of &#8216;troublesome&#8217; symptoms in infants is vague due to the non-specific and pervasive nature of GOR symptoms, reliance on parents or caregiver to report the symptoms, and the lack of an objective gold standard. Symptoms such as regurgitation or vomiting and irritable or disordered sleep can significantly impair quality of life. In an attempt to provide some objectivity, some authors have suggested that regurgitation more than four times daily over more than a two-week period in infants between three weeks and six months old should be designated as "troublesome" (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Newborn infants (defined as infants up to 28 days of life) are an interesting group to investigate for GOR, as there are wide variations in the reported prevalence and clinical course in this age group. Neonates normally present with GOR at two to three weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-Meunier-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meunier 2014</LINK>), and suffer more frequently probably due to the liquid diet and supine posture, as compared to older infants (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2014</LINK>). This is further exaggerated in preterm infants who also have a shorter and immature oesophagus with non-peristaltic oesophageal motility (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omari-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omari 1995</LINK>), leading to poor clearance of reflux material from the oesophagus. Other groups of neonates at higher risk of GOR are those with chronic lung disease, neurological impairment, genetic conditions, or gastrointestinal tract abnormalities such as tracheo-oesophageal fistula (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2014</LINK>). Generally, newborn infants have a more benign and self limiting clinical course with improvement in symptoms at 6 months old (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2015</LINK>), and spontaneous resolution by 12 to 14 months old as they move to a more solid diet and acquire neurodevelopmental maturation, achieving a more upright posture (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, GOR and GORD are difficult to diagnose in newborn infants. Unlike with older children and adolescents where GOR is often diagnosed based on verbally reported symptoms like heartburn, clinical presentations are more variable in newborn infants. Regurgitation and irritability are the most common symptoms described by caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2012</LINK>). Other presentations are oesophagitis, haematemesis, apnoea, desaturations, bradycardia, and poor growth (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2009</LINK>). A 12-item caregiver-completed Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire Revised (I-GERQ-R) is one of the most commonly used questionnaires validated for evaluating treatment response in infants with GOR (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1996</LINK>). However, studies using the I-GERQ-R for diagnosing infants with GORD have revealed puzzling results (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). The questionnaire was found to lack specificity in differentiating infants with GORD with symptomatic infants without GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2010</LINK>). Hence, there is no one symptom or cluster of symptoms that can predict complications of GOR or treatment response in newborn infants (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). Diagnosis is inferred in an infant when investigation demonstrates a high frequency or duration of reflux episodes as well as a clear association between symptoms and milk reflux without an alternative diagnosis.</P>
<P>Lower oesophageal pH monitoring with or without multiple intraluminal impedance (MII) is used to investigate GORD. Potential of hydrogen monitoring is an objective and sensitive measure of acidic oesophageal reflux, with established normal ranges based on pH cut-off value of 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2007</LINK>). The commonly used measures in pH monitoring are reflux index (percentage of entire record with oesophageal pH &lt; 4), total number of acidic reflux episodes, number of acid reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes, and the duration of the longest acidic reflux episode. However, pH monitoring is insensitive to weak-acid or non-acid reflux, which may pose an issue in newborn infants, as their milk diet can buffer the acidic gastric content. Multiple intraluminal impedance measures changes in electrical impedance caused by movement of liquid, solid, gas, or mix bolus along the oesophagus. Hence, the combined MII and pH monitoring offers the ability to measure reflux regardless of pH as well as to determine the direction, velocity, and height of reflux. However, normal ranges of MII measures for all age groups are not well established and are not consistently reproducible (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Czinn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czinn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). These investigation techniques may also detect normal variations and are unable to predict severity of symptoms, prognosis, progression, as well as response to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). Evidence is insufficient for using other investigations like histology, endoscopy, manometry, barium studies, or nuclear scintigraphy in diagnosing or excluding GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-26 18:58:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current guidelines suggest an expectant management strategy with reassurance and parental education for the management of uncomplicated GOR (<LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>). Pharmacological management is usually reserved for infants who fail to respond to conservative management or have complicated GORD, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thickening infant feeds is a simple and commonly used method in managing regurgitation and GOR in newborn infants (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madhoun-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madhoun 2015</LINK>). Commonly used feed thickeners include cereal-based thickeners made from rice or maize, gum-based thickeners from guar or locust bean, and carboxymethyl cellulose (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>). However, there is variability in practices among healthcare professionals in the prescription, preparation, and presentation of feed thickening (<LINK REF="REF-Madhoun-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madhoun 2015</LINK>). Apart from the conventional way of thickening the feed by adding the feed thickeners into the infant&#8217;s milk or liquid, there are now commercially prepared antiregurgitation formulae that help to reduce variations in preparation. Commercially prepared antiregurgitation formulae are designed to provide energy density, osmolality, and nutritional values appropriate to the needs of infants, unlike when thickeners are added to formula feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The thickening of infant feeds is generally thought to be innocuous. However, there are case series reporting the development of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants prescribed xanthan preparations, <LINK REF="REF-Beal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2012</LINK>, or locust bean gum thickeners (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK>). Concerns regarding nutritional consequences have been raised that include impaired absorption of nutrients from feeds thickened with indigestible carbohydrate (<LINK REF="REF-Bosscher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosscher 2000</LINK>), and excessive weight gain in infants using rice cereal as thickener due to higher carbohydrate and lower protein and fat content in such compositions (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2008</LINK>). Gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and constipation are reported in infants using thickened feed (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mascarenhas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mascarenhas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other conservative management strategies such as small, frequent feeds may be impractical. This approach may also increase weak-acid and non-acid GOR episode frequency due to shorter postprandial periods (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>). Positioning the infant on a head-up slope of up to 45 degrees is commonly used in clinical practice to manage GOR (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 2004</LINK>). However, the evidence for it reducing acid GOR is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>). Positioning the infant in the prone or left lateral position has been found to improve GOR but cannot be recommended in infants without cardiorespiratory monitoring due to the well-established association between the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and prone positioning (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-26 19:01:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Feed thickener is thought to prevent reflux of gastric content into the oesophagus by increasing the &#8216;stickiness&#8217; and weight of the liquid, hence retaining the feed in the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1987</LINK>). The maintenance of appropriate viscosity and consistency of thickened feed is challenging as viscosity varies depending on the type of liquid into which the feed thickener is added (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 2011</LINK>), the dwell time, temperature of liquid, and amount of saliva (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast, addition of feed thickeners may increase the energy density and osmolarity of feeds, leading to an increase in the frequency of relaxation of lower oesophageal sphincter and a delay in gastric emptying (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>), thus worsening GOR (<LINK REF="REF-Minami-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minami 1984</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-26 19:07:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux is a frequent problem in infants, and feed thickeners, which are simple to use and perceived to be harmless, continue to be prescribed despite the lack of good-quality scientific evidence to support their use. The previous version of this review, conducted nearly 14 years ago, located no suitable studies for inclusion. This review was restricted to infants up to 28 days of age. We have expanded the age of inclusion to six months (or six months corrected gestational age for those born preterm), as GOR peaks at four months of age, and GORD continues to be a problem throughout the first half of infancy.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-11-27 09:44:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the use of feed thickeners in infants up to six months of age with GOR in terms of reduction in a) signs and symptoms of GOR, b) reflux episodes on pH probe monitoring or intraluminal impedance or a combination of both, or c) histological evidence of oesophagitis.</P>

<P>We included all randomised controlled trials that examined the effects of thickening infant formula as compared to unthickened feeds (no treatment or placebo) on GOR in infants up to six months of age (six months corrected gestational age for those born preterm). We included trials reported as abstracts provided we were able to obtain sufficient information from the abstract or by contacting the author.</P>
<P>We excluded cross-over studies. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a condition that spontaneously resolves with age, and therefore results of cross-over trials are likely to be confounded by the natural resolution of the condition. Some cross-over studies guarded against this by using feed thickener and control intervention alternately. However, residual thickened feeds may still be present in the gastric region due to insufficient washout period.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2017-10-26 19:27:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included healthy infants with signs or symptoms suggestive of GOR, or those with a diagnosis of GOR based on 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring or oesophagitis on biopsy, or both in the review.<BR/>

<P>For this update we included full-term infants less than six months old or preterm infants up to six months of age corrected for prematurity at the time of inclusion in the trial. We excluded trials including combined populations of infants within and above this age criteria if results for infants within this specified age range were not reported separately from infants above our age criteria. We attempted to contact the author for this information prior to exclusion.</P>
<P>Previous versions of this review were restricted to including only studies in full-term infants up 28 days old and preterm infants up to 44 weeks corrected gestational age. We have expanded the age range, as the majority of infants present with GOR after the first two to three weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Meunier-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meunier 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>). Reassurance and parental education are the usual first-line management for uncomplicated reflux (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>). Hence, feed thickeners are rarely started by the first 28 days of life. In addition, the prevalence of GOR peaks at four months of age, and GORD commonly continues to be a problem until six months of age, when most infants start having solids in their diet and acquire the neurological maturity to sit with support in a more upright posture (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1997</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-27 09:56:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meta-analysis of the included studies found that usage of feed thickeners reduced the frequency of regurgitation or vomiting by two episodes per day when compared to control. The evidence was of moderate quality due to serious study limitations (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was unclear risk of bias in allocation concealment and high risk of bias for blinding, as frequency of regurgitation was dependent on parental report who were likely to note the higher viscosity of the thickened formula. These limitations lowered our confidence in the effect estimate. The 95% confidence interval for the estimate of effect was narrow, consistent with a reduction of between 1.6 to 2.3 episodes per day. <LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK> had the highest weight in the meta-analysis, of 85%, due to its smaller standard deviation and larger sample size compared to the other five studies included in the analysis. However, the smaller standard deviation could be a result of using the endpoint score rather than the change from baseline due to insufficient information in the report. This finding remained after removing two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK> for the usage of endpoint scores rather than change from baseline score, and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK> due to the reporting of median rather than mean values), with more equal distribution of weight across the remaining four studies, ranging from 4% to 34%. The repeat meta-analysis of the remaining four studies found that feed thickeners reduced frequency of regurgitation or vomiting by 1.8 episodes per day with 95% confidence interval of reduction between 0.8 and 2.8 episodes per day. Although only the cornstarch- and alginate-thickened groups showed significant reduction in the frequency of regurgitation or vomiting (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), we found no significant interaction between the subtotal estimates for the type of feed thickener subgroups. This may because there are very few studies in each feed thickener subgroup.</P>
<P>We also found infants given feed thickeners to be 2.5 times more likely to be asymptomatic from regurgitation or vomiting at the end of the intervention period compared to control infants. However, this evidence was of low quality 
(
<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>
). Besides the serious study limitation mentioned above, there was serious imprecision. This analysis was derived from just two studies, including the largest study in the review recruiting 166 infants (<LINK REF="STD-Iacono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Iacono 2002</LINK>), which was reported as an abstract only. Results for whether feed thickeners improved non-regurgitation signs or symptoms were conflicting.</P>
<P>We also found usage of feed thickeners to improve the oesophageal pH probe parameters of reflux index by 5%, the number of reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes by 3.4 episodes per day, and the duration of longest reflux episodes by 12.4 minutes when compared to control. However, the evidence for these findings was of low quality due to serious study limitation (unclear/high randomisation and allocation concealment bias) as well as imprecision 
(
<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>
). The analyses were based on two trials with a total of 116 infants. Only one trial in 96 infants reported the number of reflux episodes per hour detected by oesophageal pH probe, and did not show any difference.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects reported between the control and feed-thickened groups in the majority of the included studies except for <LINK REF="STD-Iacono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Iacono 2002</LINK>, where the intervention was suspended in 14 infants (17%) in the carob flour-thickened group due to diarrhoea. The number of infants in the control group with diarrhoea was not reported in this study. Similarly, the evidence for these findings was of low quality due to serious imprecision and publication bias. None of the studies was designed to measure side effects 
(

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-11-27 09:51:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Firstly, these findings are broadly applicable only to formula-feeding term infants up to six months of age presenting with uncomplicated GOR diagnosed by clinical symptoms, including the frequency of regurgitation. These findings may not be applicable to preterm infants despite reflux being a common problem in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Drug-and-Therapeutics-Bulletin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin 2010</LINK>). The lack of studies in preterm infants may be due to the difficulty in diagnosing or measuring GOR in preterm infants as well as the lack of feed thickeners that meet the nutritional demands of preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2013</LINK>). The use of alginate in preterm infants was found to reduce the acid oesophageal exposure detected by combined pH and impedence monitoring (pH-MII) in two case control studies in 28 and 32 preterm infants, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Corvaglia-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Corvaglia 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corvaglia-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Corvaglia 2011a</LINK>), and in a pH probe cohort study in 50 preterm infants (<LINK REF="STD-Atasay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Atasay 2010</LINK>). However, there was no effect on non-acid GOR. The impact of alginate in reducing symptoms of GOR in preterm infants is unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Corvaglia-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Corvaglia 2011</LINK> found that alginate did not reduce the frequency of GOR-related apnoea, while <LINK REF="STD-Atasay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Atasay 2010</LINK> found improvement in vomiting and weight gain. <LINK REF="STD-Corvaglia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Corvaglia 2012</LINK>, a case control study of 28 preterm infants, found that specially designed preterm formula thickened with the digestible carbohydrate amylopectin reduced the number of acid GOR episodes without improving the crucial acid oesophageal exposure and non-acid GOR detected by pH-MII. In <LINK REF="STD-Corvaglia-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corvaglia 2006</LINK>, a case control study of 5 preterm infants, starch-thickened expressed human breast milk showed no effect on number of acid and non-acid GOR episodes detected by pH-MII.</P>
<P>The findings of this review may also not be applicable to infants with GOR due to neurological impairment or other medical reasons, such as cow's milk intolerance. The use of feed thickeners such as alginates in breastfeeding infants, including their efficacy and impact on breastfeeding rates, have also not been fully investigated in trials to date. This is crucial, as the prevalence of GOR in breastfeeding infants is similar to bottle-feeding infants (<LINK REF="REF-Barak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barak 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from diarrhoea reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Iacono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Iacono 2002</LINK>), the majority of studies reported no significant differences in side effects between the control and feed thickener groups. However, the studies were mainly short term, with follow-up periods of up to eight weeks, and were not powered to detect side effects. Hence, small but real differences in adverse effects may not be found without a large-scale randomised controlled trial or observational study. In addition, some reports excluded infants who had side effects from the analysis.</P>
<P>The long-term impact of excessive weight gain in feed thickener groups noted in some studies is unclear, especially with the use of non-standard thickened formula when feed thickeners are added to a standard formula at home (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hegar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hegar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moya-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2005</LINK>). This may provide an excessively high caloric density. However, there is increasing evidence that infants regulate the volume of intake depending on calorie density, although the excessive calories added due to feed thickeners are mostly in the form of carbohydrates, and the risk of high-carbohydrate but low-protein feeding remains even when the infant self regulates (<LINK REF="REF-Agosti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agosti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carver 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 2001</LINK>). The allergenicity of commercially available thickening agents is also uncertain to date, although none of the studies reported any such events.</P>
<P>The severity of GOR is usually dependent on the frequency and volume of regurgitation or vomiting, or both. Although our meta-analyses show that feed thickeners reduced the frequency of regurgitation or vomiting, the impact on volume or severity of the events is unclear due to the lack of standardisation in how these variables were reported in the four included studies that reported volume or severity of regurgitation (<LINK REF="STD-Iacono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Iacono 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-10-27 21:15:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies varied (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The included studies depended on parental report of signs or symptoms. Despite attempts to blind the parents or caregivers from the intervention, and the fact that thickened formula mainly thickens only when it comes in contact with acid in the stomach, it was likely that parents may still have noted the higher viscosity of the thickened formula compared to control unthickened feeds. This could potentially lead to overestimation of the reduction in frequency of regurgitation or vomiting and the incidence of side effects in the feed thickener group. However, this lack of blinding may be inevitable in such studies.</P>
<P>We assessed the randomisation or allocation concealment method as at unclear or high risk of bias in five of the eight included studies. This may have introduced selection bias in our analysis. There was an imbalance in the baseline characteristics of infants in the feed thickener and control groups in four studies. In three trials infants in the intervention group had a higher number of vomiting episodes per day or larger measures of regurgitation volume than infants in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2005</LINK>). Infants in the intervention group in the <LINK REF="STD-Moya-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 1999</LINK> study were older than those in the control group. These imbalances may have resulted in an overestimation of the effects of the intervention, as infants in the former three studies had more severe symptoms that were likely to respond better to feed thickeners, while older infants in the latter study were more likely to recover from regurgitation due to spontaneous resolution of the condition with age.</P>
<P>Three studies declared receiving funding from a pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2005</LINK>). We did not assess publication bias in our analysis as there were fewer than 10 included studies. Given these limitations, the strength of the evidence presented must be interpreted with caution.</P>

<P>Similiar to four previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2012</LINK>), our review found moderate-certainty evidence that feed thickeners reduce the frequency of regurgitation or vomiting per day in formula-feeding term infants up to six months of age presenting with uncomplicated GOR. Although only the cornstarch- and alginate-thickened groups showed a significant reduction in frequency of regurgitation or vomiting (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), the evidence in our current analysis was insufficient to conclude that one form of feed thickener is superior to another, which is in concordance with previous reviews. However, unlike in previous reviews, we found that feed thickeners also improved pH probe study parameters of reflux index (measure of oesophageal acid exposure), number of acid reflux episodes over 5 minutes, and duration of longest acid reflux episode, but noted no difference in number of acid reflux episodes per hour. However, the strength of evidence for this is low, as only two included studies reported pH probe study parameters.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Neu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2012</LINK> (search date 2002 to 2011) reviewed the literature for full-text articles in the English language on non-surgical treatment for symptoms of irritability in infants with GORD up to 23 months of age. Cross-over trials were included in the review. The review found three studies, and the authors concluded that infants treated with rice- and corn-thickened formula had more reduction in irritability and reflux than the control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2008</LINK> (search date up to May 2008) found that feed thickeners were moderately effective in treating GOR in healthy infants based on 14 included studies recruiting 877 infants. The review included cross-over trials and infants up to two years of age. The authors found that feed thickener improved regurgitation or vomiting and weight gain symptoms with no serious adverse effects being reported. However, apart from the duration of longest acid reflux episode, they did not find improvement in pH probe study parameters, including the reflux index. They also found no definitive evidence showing that one particular feed thickener is more effective than another.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2004</LINK> (search date up to January 2003) concluded that feed thickeners reduced the frequency and severity of regurgitation of developmentally normal children aged between 1 month and 2 years based on 8 studies recruiting 419 infants. There was no difference in reflux index obtained from pH probe parameter.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2002</LINK> (search date up to November 2000) found that feed thickeners reduced vomiting symptoms without reducing measurable reflux based on 4 studies recruiting 188 infants.</P>

<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a physiological self resolving phenomenon in infants that does not necessarily require any treatment. However, GOR becomes pathological when it causes complications or troublesome symptoms. The aim of management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) should be to reduce symptoms and prevent complications while maintaining normal growth without side effects of the treatment. However, this distinction between GOR and GORD may be unclear at times. Frequent regurgitation is a common cause of parental anxiety and referral for specialist input. The cornerstone in the management of uncomplicated GOR should be parental education and reassurance with modification of feeding frequency and volume if necessary. However, if regurgitation symptoms persist in term bottle-feeding infants, feed thickeners may be considered, as they have been found to reduce the frequency of regurgitation or vomiting by two episodes per day when compared to control treatment. The reduction by two episodes of regurgitation or vomiting per day may be of clinical significance to parents or caregivers. This therapeutic benefit of feed thickener was reproducible after removing studies with high risk of bias from our analysis. However, the improvement in pH probe parameters, especially reflux index, with feed thickeners should be interpreted with caution as there was very limited evidence available.</P>
<P>Due to the small number of studies available, our analysis provided insufficient information to conclude whether one type of feed thickener is superior to another. However, it may be prudent to use feed thickeners that have undergone clinical evaluation. Although alginate can be used in breastfeeding infants, so far there is insufficient evidence to show its effectiveness and impact on breastfeeding infants. There is also insufficient evidence to recommend the use of feed thickeners including alginate in preterm infants, as well as reported side effects that include necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Beal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-27 21:54:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the widespread use of feed thickeners such as alginates in neonatal units (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 2004</LINK>), there is a lack of evidence for the use of feed thickeners in preterm infants. The results of this review suggest that a randomised controlled trial should be carried out in preterm infants up to 44 weeks corrected age to investigate the role of feed thickeners in the treatment of GORD. A randomised controlled trial design is crucial for investigating the efficacy of any treatment for GOR, as it is well accepted that the condition improves and resolves spontaneously as the infant grows. Comparison with a parallel control group, selected by appropriate randomisation, is essential to differentiate the natural progression of the disease from the effect of the intervention. In addition, concerns about serious side effects such as necrotising enterocolitis warrant that there should be a strict safety reporting mechanism, and the intervention should be started only after infants are tolerating full enteral feeds. Feed thickeners should be specially designed to meet the nutritional demands of preterm infants. Such a study should consider objective outcomes such as pH probe study or combined pH and impedence measures, as well as clinical outcomes such as regurgitation frequency and severity, GOR-related apnoeas and desaturations, and growth to provide clinically relevant conclusions.</P>
<P>For term infants, further parallel-group randomised controlled trials exploring the effect of different types of feed thickeners would be informative. Comparison with an appropriate control must be included to differentiate between the natural progression of the disease and the effect of the intervention. Although parental reporting of symptoms of GOR may be affected by incomplete blinding, it should still be reported alongside objective measurements such as pH probe study or combined pH and impedence monitoring, as the reported outcomes are more relevant for clinical practice. The use of a validated regurgitation scoring system such as the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire Revised (I-GERQ-R) or the Vandenplas scoring system should be considered to enable comparability between studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>We have made the following changes since the last update of the review in 2002.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We expanded the age criteria for the participants from 'full-term infants less than 28 days and preterm infants up to 44 weeks corrected age&#8217; to &#8216;full-term infants less than six months and preterm infants up to six months corrected age&#8217;, because the majority of infants present with uncomplicated reflux only after the first two to three weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Meunier-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meunier 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>). Reassurance and parental education is the usual first-line management for uncomplicated reflux (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2015</LINK>), and feed thickeners are rarely started in the first 28 days of life. We used the six-month cut-off due to the natural progression of GOR, which is believed to start improving by six months of age, when the infant starts on a more solid diet and achieves neurodevelopmental maturation to maintain a more upright posture (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We included Gaviscon Infant (alginate preparation without antacid) as an eligible intervention for inclusion in the review. We excluded other preparations of Gaviscon or alginate with antacid components. Gaviscon Infant works primarily by thickening the feed and does not have antacid properties, unlike other preparations of Gaviscon. We performed a subgroup analysis to determine if the results differed when trials investigating Gaviscon Infant as feed thickener were excluded.</LI>
<LI>We streamlined the primary outcomes to three outcome measures that we felt to be important to parents, caregivers, and clinicians. They were: i) regurgitation, posseting, or vomiting; ii) failure to thrive; and iii) reflux index. We analysed the remaining outcome measures as secondary outcome measures.</LI>
<LI>We also noted number of episodes per day of: i) regurgitation, posseting, vomiting, or haematemesis; ii) respiratory symptoms (cough, apnoeas, and recurrent oxygen desaturation); and iii) bradycardias as continuous and separate outcomes. We used change from baseline measurements in preference to final measurements.</LI>
<LI>We did not assess cough as a side effect of feed thickener, as it was already considered to be a symptom of GOR.</LI>
<LI>We carried out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of change from baseline versus endpoint values on the analysis.</LI>

The latest NASPGHAN/ESPGHAN GERD guideline recommends for infants as the first step, non-pharmacological intervention including body positioning and thickened formula. The aims of this study are 1- To evaluate a clinical GER score in infants that were fed with an AR formula containing a mixed potato/corn starch 1,8 grams/100ml , ARplus formula containing 2,2 grams/100ml and a standard formula at baseline and after four weeks. 2-To evaluate the body weight variation during this period of time.Methods: Methods: 66 infants younger than 6 months old were selected to participate for this prospective randomized blind study. A clinical GER score described by Orenstein and modified by Kleinman et al, 2006 and body weight variation were performed at baseline and after 4 weeks in three groups (AR formula, ARplus formula and standard formula). All of them containing 67 Kcal/100 ml of energy and were provided by Nestl&amp;#195;&amp;#169;-Brazil.Results: Results: Median age: 103 &amp;#194;&amp;#177; 42 days. Dropout was 5/66 cases. Median weight at baseline: 5.900&amp;#194;&amp;#177;1387 grams. GER score was registered at baseline and after 28 days: AR group N=19 (initial score 18,6 &amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8220; final score:9,0 delta= - 9,6); ARplus group N=21(initial score :17,6- final score:8,0 delta=-9,6) and standard group N=21 (initial score =20,1- final score=13,8 delta= -6,24) p=0,026. Success Index was defined by the clinical score decreasing more than 6 points and it was 94,7% in AR group, 85,7% ARplus group and 57% in standard formula group (p&amp;lt;0,05 comparing AR groups with standard). Weight variation was 857 grams AR group, 830 grams ARplus group and 543 grams standard group. Delta weight between AR groups and standard was significant (Bonferroni alpha coefficient =0,02 and 0,023 respectively). For the different symptoms ARplus had better performance on refusal to eat (p=0,007), stop feeding (p= 0,007) and arching back (p=0,015).Conclusion: Conclusions: 1- clinical symptoms of GER decreased in all groups but less consistently under standard formula. AR formulas determined higher weight gain as compared to stand;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-10-28 22:52:15 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<P>Forest plot of comparison: 1 Regurgitation, posseting, or vomiting, outcome: 1.1 Number of episodes per day.</P>
<P>
<B>Assumptions</B>
</P>
<P>1. There was insufficient information in <LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK> to report the change of baseline value, hence we used the endpoint data instead. Change from baseline value was used for the remaining five studies, where P value was used to determine the standard deviation for the change from baseline value.</P>
<P>2. Frequency of regurgitation rather than vomiting was used for the <LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2005</LINK> study.</P>
<P>3. In <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1999</LINK>, median number of episodes of regurgitation was reported rather than the mean value. As the sample size was more than 25, it was assumed that median and mean were similar (<LINK REF="REF-Hozo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hozo 2005</LINK>), and the standard deviation for the mean difference was obtained using the reported P value (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. We halved control groups for <LINK REF="STD-Hegar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hegar 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moya-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 1999</LINK>, as these were three-arm trials involving one control and two intervention arms.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-29 00:07:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of the trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation and the blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors independently assessed each study. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. We added this information to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table, computer random number generator);</P>
<P>b. high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>b. high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants;</P>
<P>b. low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. low risk for outcome assessors;</P>
<P>b. high risk for outcome assessors;</P>
<P>c. unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of the data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>a. low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>b. high risk (where not all of the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>7. Other sources of bias. Did the study appear to be free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>a. low risk;</P>
<P>b. high risk;</P>
<P>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
