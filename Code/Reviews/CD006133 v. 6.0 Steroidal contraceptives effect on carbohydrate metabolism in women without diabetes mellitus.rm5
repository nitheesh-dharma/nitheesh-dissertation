<TITLE>Hormone contraceptives and how the body uses carbohydrates in women without diabetes</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-08 18:26:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormone contraceptives may change how the body handles carbohydrates (starches and sugars). Changes may include lower ability to use sugar from food and more problems with the body's insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar. Problems with blood sugar can increase risk for diabetes and heart disease. These issues have been raised mainly with birth control methods that contain the hormone estrogen.</P>
<P>In April 2014, we looked for randomized trials of how the body handles carbohydrates when using birth control methods with hormones. Outcomes were blood glucose or insulin levels. Birth control methods could contain estrogen and progestin or just progestin. The type could be pills, shots (injections), implants (matchstick-size rods put under the skin), the vaginal ring, or an intrauterine device (IUD). The studies had to compare two types of birth control or one type versus a placebo or 'dummy' method.</P>
<P>We included 31 trials. None had a placebo. Of 34 pairs of birth control methods compared, eight showed some difference by study groups. Twelve trials studied pills with desogestrel. The few differences were not consistent. Three trials looked at the etonogestrel ring. One showed the ring group had lower insulin than the pill group.</P>
<P>Eight trials looked at the progestin norethisterone. A group using norethisterone pills had less glucose change than those taking other pills. In another study, a group using the injectable &#8216;depo&#8217; (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) had higher glucose and insulin than the group using another injectable.</P>
<P>Of five new trials, two used different estrogen types. In one study, a group taking a pill with ethinyl valerate had lower glucose than a group taking a standard pill. Two other trials compared taking pills for several cycles without stopping (extended use) versus usual use. In one using a dienogest pill, the extended-use group had more glucose change. A small trial used two levonorgestrel pills, and looked at obese and normal weight women. The outcomes did not differ much between those groups.</P>
<P>In women without diabetes, hormone contraceptives have little effect on the body's carbohydrate use. Few studies compared the same types of birth control. Therefore, we cannot make strong statements. Many trials had small numbers of women, and many women dropped out. Older trials often did not report all the study methods. Many trials did not include overweight women.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-08 18:26:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In April 2014, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. The initial search also included EMBASE.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-19 20:59:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin measures.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-19 21:00:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-15 18:32:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.</P>
<P>Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from levonorgestrel COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).</P>
<P>Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).</P>
<P>Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).</P>
<P>Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17&#946;-estradiol had lower means than the levonorgestrel group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two levonorgestrel COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-28 15:48:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.</P>
<P>We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-22 17:14:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many hormonal contraceptives have been associated with changes in carbohydrate metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Dorflinger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorflinger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2003</LINK>). Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance, which are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reaven-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reaven 2005</LINK>). These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.</P>
<P>To reduce side effects of steroidal contraceptives, changes have been made in the estrogen dose and newer progestins have been developed (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Mooren-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Mooren 1999</LINK>). New formulations of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are often examined for their relationship with carbohydrate metabolism (<LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2011</LINK>). In addition, estrogens other than ethinyl estradiol have been developed for contraception (<LINK REF="STD-Agren-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Agren 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2011</LINK>), and these may have different metabolic effects. Progestin-only contraceptives do not carry the same risk of vascular complications as contraceptives that contain estrogen, so they may be recommended for women at risk for diabetes or vascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2003</LINK>). However, progestin-only contraceptives may influence carbohydrate metabolism; results from studies with varying designs have been inconsistent (<LINK REF="REF-Dorflinger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorflinger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kivela-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kivela 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Little is known about the effect of hormonal contraceptives among women at risk for metabolic problems as opposed to healthy populations (<LINK REF="REF-Dorflinger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorflinger 2002</LINK>). Glucose changes have been noted in users of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) with greater body weight (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2003</LINK>). Due to the risk of cardiovascular complications, the World Health Organization classifies combined contraceptives as category 2 for women with diabetes who do not have vascular disease and 3/4 if vascular disease is evident (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). For category 2, the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks. In category 3, use of the method is not usually recommended, unless more appropriate methods are not feasible. Category 4 implies the method should not be used under the circumstances. Progestin-only contraceptives are generally classed as category 2 for women with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). The exception is DMPA when vascular disease has been identified; then DMPA is category 3.</P>
<P>The prevalence of overweight (including obesity) has increased worldwide, along with the effects on insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Reaven-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reaven 2005</LINK>). Chronic diseases have not been emphasized in development efforts, although they are a major problem in less developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Strong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strong 2005</LINK>). Low- and middle-income countries account for 80% of deaths due to chronic disease. Overweight is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Reaven-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reaven 2005</LINK>), which may indicate increased risk for diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2003</LINK>). Overweight and obesity are generally determined with the body mass index (BMI), which is based on weight and height [BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)<SUP>2</SUP>] (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009</LINK>). BMI generally reflects the amount of fat, whereas body weight mainly addresses overall body size. Frequently used BMI categories are 25 to 29.9 (kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) for overweight and 30 or higher for obesity, although these cutoffs may not be optimal for all ethnic groups (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huxley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huxley 2005</LINK>). A Cochrane review examined the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in among women who are overweight or obese versus women in a lower weight or BMI group (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2013a</LINK>). The researchers only found three studies using BMI rather than body weight. Only one of the three studies showed a higher pregnancy risk for overweight women. The risk of oral contraceptive failure among overweight or obese women may depend on whether the assessment is based on perfect use or typical use (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We examined whether steroidal contraceptives affect carbohydrate metabolism among women without previously known diabetes mellitus. We also searched for data on women who were overweight and therefore at risk for diabetes. At the time of the initial review, no systematic review on this topic included only randomized controlled trials.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-11-16 19:55:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We generally entered the data in the units in which they were reported and the units are specified in the tables. The exception was fasting glucose for <LINK REF="STD-Ludicke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ludicke 2002</LINK>, which was converted from g/L to &#956;g/dl in order to combine the data with those from <LINK REF="STD-Rechberger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rechberger 2004</LINK>. Similar outcomes were often measured with similar units across studies, e.g., fasting serum glucose or fasting serum insulin, so the reader can examine the values across studies. Researchers may have measured the outcome based on serum, plasma, or whole blood, which can affect the absolute values. However, the primary interest for this review was the difference between groups within a study, so the actual units were less important than size of the mean difference.</P>
<P>In some cases, the insulin results from different studies were not in the same range, even when units were converted into the same system of measurement, so the data were not combined in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bowes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bowes 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gillespy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gillespy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ludicke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ludicke 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rechberger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rechberger 2004</LINK>). The researchers may have used different assays. Also, studies were not combined if different measures were used, such as plasma versus blood values. For one report (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1998</LINK>), standard deviations were calculated from the 95% CI.</P>
<P>Glucose and insulin measures were generally presented as fasting values or the area under the curve (AUC) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If the AUC data were not available, the two-hour response values were used. If change data were available, those results were used rather than values at a point in time. While several studies reported change, few included the variation data needed for analysis.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-04-24 21:49:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We tested for heterogeneity where relevant; none was evident. Fixed-effect and random-effects will give the same result if no heterogeneity exists, which is also the case if a comparison includes a single study. There is no consensus regarding the use of either model.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-04-22 17:09:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>For continuous variables, such as the mean area under the curve for glucose, the mean difference was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. RevMan uses the inverse variance approach (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). A fixed-effect model does not require the assumption of normal distribution for the effects. Fixed and random effects give the same result if no heterogeneity exists, as when a comparison includes only one study.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated. An example is the proportion of women who had blood glucose categorized as outside the normal range. The Peto OR is useful when treatment effects are small and when events are not very common (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This approach performs well under many circumstances, except when the study arms are severely unbalanced, which rarely occurs in RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). </P>

<P>A total of 31 trials met the inclusion criteria and provided sufficient data for analysis in this review. Most (N=21) compared different types of combined oral contraceptives (COCs). The COCs varied in the types and doses of progestin and estrogen. Two trials compared different regimens of the same COC (<LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiegratz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wiegratz 2010</LINK>).

<P>Most of the studies measured glucose and insulin by fasting levels or by area under the curve (AUC) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Others included C-peptide or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The percent glycosylation reflects the amount of glucose available in the prior two to six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kivela-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kivela 2001</LINK>). C-peptide levels during OGTT reflect the amount of insulin being produced by the body, and may be more accurate than insulin levels in the blood (<LINK REF="STD-Skouby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Skouby 2005</LINK>). Some recent studies included calculated estimates of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity.</P>
<P>We found little data to assess the effects of steroidal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in women who were overweight. One small trial stratified by weight (<LINK REF="STD-Beasley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 2012</LINK>). More than half of the trials (18/31) had weight restrictions as eligibility criteria, such as body mass index (BMI) less than 25 or 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or body weight within 20% of 'ideal'. Some of the included trials reported on weight gain in participants. However, weight changes have been examined for users of combination contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 2011</LINK>) and for users of progestin-only contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Duration of the trials ranged from 3 cycles to 24 months. Of the 31 trials, 15 had treatment duration of 6 or 7 cycles or 6 months and 9 trials reported durations of 12 months or 13 cycles. The remainder were 3 to 5 cycles (N=3), 9 cycles (N=2), or 24 cycles or months (N=2).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-04-22 17:22:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Due to differences in the types of progestin compared or in the doses of progestin or estrogen, only five comparisons involved meta-analysis. For many of the trials, carbohydrate metabolism was a secondary outcome. </P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-28 16:00:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Our first hypothesis appears to be supported by the results: combined hormonal contraceptives do not cause clinically important changes in carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes. In the trials that analyzed change, the amount of change was generally small. When newer formulations were compared with other COCs, including 'standard' pills like levonorgestrel 150 µg plus EE 30 µg, few differences were noted in the measures of carbohydrate metabolism. However, no trial was placebo-controlled, which is not unusual for contraceptive studies due to ethical concerns.</P>
<P>Of 34 comparisons, 31 examined compared different hormonal contraceptives, two examined different regimens, and one stratified by body mass index groups within the contraceptive groups. Eight of the comparisons showed any notable differences. These results were from trials that examined COCs containing desogestrel, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, nomegestrel acetate plus 17&#946;-estradiol; an extended regimen of a dienogest-containing COC; the etonogestrel vaginal ring; and the injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA).</P>
<P>Ten trials compared desogestrel-containing COCs versus levonorgestrel-containing COCs. A few differences were noted in three older trials, but the results were not consistent across trials, outcomes, or time points. A meta-analysis of two studies showed higher mean fasting glucose with the desogestrel preparation, while analyses within the individual studies showed a lower mean fasting glucose level and a higher two-hour glucose response. The third study showed higher mean AUC insulin with the desogestrel-COC; AUC is the area under the curve during a glucose tolerance test. These seemingly contradictory results were discussed in <LINK REF="REF-Henzl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 2000</LINK>. However, the doses of desogestrel and estrogen varied across studies and the comparison COCs varied in composition, too.</P>
<P>Drospirenone is one of the 'newer' progestins, and is derived from spironolactone (<LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2011</LINK>). Two studies of drospirenone COCs versus desogestrel COCs indicated that the effects on carbohydrate metabolism were limited and not significantly different from those of the comparison formulations.</P>
<P>Three trials examined the etonogestrel-releasing vaginal ring versus a COC containing levonorgestrel or desogestrel. Etonogestrel is the active metabolite of desogestrel. The one notable difference showed the ring group had a lower mean AUC for insulin. In addition, one trial studied an etonogestrel implant with no notable results.</P>
<P>Norethisterone is part of the estrane group of progestins, which are derived from testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2011</LINK>). The gonane group was developed later, and includes levonorgestrel and its derivatives, e.g., desogestrel and gestodene among others (<LINK REF="REF-Henzl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 2000</LINK>). These groups of progestins differ metabolically (<LINK REF="REF-Wallach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallach 2000</LINK>). Five trials examined COC preparations containing norethisterone, also referred to as norethindrone. One difference was noted in which the norethisterone-COC had a lower mean change in glucose two-hour response compared to a levonorgestrel-COC group, and that large trial had a high loss. <LINK REF="REF-Henzl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 2000</LINK> had suggested the effects of norethindrone with EE on carbohydrate metabolism were modest. In addition, three older trials examined injectables containing norethisterone. In one study, the group assigned to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) had higher means for fasting glucose, glucose two-hour response, and fasting insulin compared to the group using norethisterone enanthate. Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a part of the early group of progestins called pregnanes (<LINK REF="REF-Henzl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The five newest trials had other comparisons. Two examined newer COCs containing 17&#946;-estradiol (E<SUB>2</SUB>) or estradiol valerate (E<SUB>2</SUB>V). In one, the group with nomegestrel acetate plus E<SUB>2</SUB> had a lower mean than a levonorgestrel-COC group for incremental AUC glucose and for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Another two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest-containing COC, the extended-use group had a greater mean change in AUC glucose. One trial using two levonorgestrel COCs stratified by body mass index (normal or obese). While the BMI groups did not differ, the group assigned to the lower dose preparation showed a smaller mean change in fasting glucose. The study was small and had high losses.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-28 15:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The 34 comparisons provided adequate Information to examine the effects of various hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism. However, only 7 of 31 trials mentioned whether any individuals had abnormal values for glucose or insulin (dichotomous data). While no trial was placebo-controlled, many studies compared a newer contraceptive to an older or more commonly used one. Those trials examined whether the newer formulation had a greater effect on carbohydrate metabolism than the comparison contraceptive.</P>
<P>Data were insufficient to test our second hypothesis that progestin-only contraceptives cause changes in carbohydrate metabolism among women at risk for diabetes due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial with COCs stratified by body mass index (obese versus normal) but the study had high losses. Therefore, we still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight or obese.</P>

Another four trials had report authors from pharmaceutical companies, but the reports did not have funding information. One of the four had a statistically significant difference. While the proportion of differences appears slightly larger for those with pharmaceutical funding, the number of studies is small. In addition, the statistically significant differences did not consistently favor the experimental intervention.</P>

<P>Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. Most effects seemed to be limited, yet not consistent across the types of contraceptives studied. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. However, we still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight or obese. Most of the women in these trials were healthy and of normal weight.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-14 19:50:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Some progestins appeared to have more favorable results regarding carbohydrate metabolism, but none were clearly superior. More studies of the same contraceptives would help in making recommendations for clinical practice. Many trials had small numbers of participants and large losses to follow-up. More recent trials had improved study design and more complete reporting. Only one small study compared normal and obese women. The field needs trials that include women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight or obese.</P>

<P>Eighteen studies had sufficient data for analysis. Previously, we had included 16 with the results as reported by the investigators. In 2012, we excluded them along with two new studies, because we could not adequately compare the study groups. The descriptive results and data limitations are given below. For some trials, medians were reported rather than means, which could be appropriate for skewed data. Several had carbohydrate metabolism as a secondary outcome and the results were mentioned in the text. We wrote to investigators for additional information, but many studies were too old to obtain further data.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kuhl-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhl 1985</LINK> studied desogestrel 150 µg + EE 30 µg versus a triphasic levonorgestrel preparation.

Between-group comparisons were not available.</P>
<P>After comparing desogestrel 150 µg + EE 20 µg versus gestodene 75 µg + EE 30 µg, <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1991</LINK> reported no changes in the glucose and insulin measures at 6 or 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Rakoczi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rakoczi 1985</LINK> studied a desogestrel preparation similar to those in <LINK REF="STD-Luyckx-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Luyckx 1986</LINK>, and the triphasic levonorgestrel was the same.

<P>Additional trials studied OCs containing desogestrel versus other preparations:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2009</LINK> studied a COC containing desogestrel 150 µg + EE 30 µg versus chlormadinone acetate 2 mg + EE 30 µg. The groups were reportedly not significantly different for the outcomes measured.</LI>

At 12 months, the desogestrel group had decreases in plasma insulin (fasting and AUC) but increases in C-peptide (fasting and AUC) and in glucose AUC. The cyproterone acetate group reportedly had increases in fasting values and AUC for glucose and C-peptide.</LI>
<LI>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Oelkers-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oelkers 1995</LINK> compared three drospirenone-containing COCs versus a levonorgestrel COC: 1) drospirenone 3 mg + EE 30 µg; 2) drospirenone 3 mg + EE 20 µg; 3) drospirenone 3 mg + EE 15 µg; 4) levonorgestrel 150 µg + EE 30 µg.

<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2010</LINK> compared the effects of chlormadinone acetate (CMA) 2 mg + EE 20 µg for 24 days each cycle versus desogestrel 150 µg + EE 20 µg or levonorgestrel 150 µg + EE 30 µg for 21 days each cycle. The researchers reported the median percentage changes in the carbohydrate measures, but did not provide means and standard deviations nor any P values. Reported results included the following: AUC glucose increased about half as much in the CMA group than in the other two groups; AUC insulin decreased slightly in both the CMA and levonorgestrel group and hardly changed for the desogestrel group; and AUC C-peptide decreased slightly in the CMA group while the levonorgestrel and desogestrel groups had increases.</P>
