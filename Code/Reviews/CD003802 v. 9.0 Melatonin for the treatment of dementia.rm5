<P>There are a number of studies that suggest a relationship between decline of melatonin function and the symptoms of dementia. Meta-analysis was conducted on data from three randomised, placebo controlled trials that were designed to evaluate melatonin for managing dementia-related cognitive changes; data also were pooled from two of these trials that evaluated melatonin for managing mood and behavioral disturbances. Significantly improved outcomes were found from the meta-analysis of psychopathologic behavior and mood scale scores. Melatonin treatment may be effective for the treatment of dementia-related psychopathologic behavior disturbances. No evidence was found to support the effectiveness of melatonin for the treatment of cognitive impairment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:25:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Melatonin, a naturally-occurring hormone secreted by the pineal gland in the centre of the brain, was discovered by Lerner and colleagues at Yale University School of Medicine in 1958 (<LINK REF="REF-Wurtman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wurtman 1989</LINK>). It is biosynthesized from tryptophan via serotonin. It has a number of effects relating to a variety of bodily functions. These include circadian rhythmicity (physiological sleep onset and sleep-wake cycles) and cyclic hormone release (<LINK REF="REF-Webb-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1995</LINK>); regulation of the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Maestroni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maestroni 1993</LINK>); and more recently discovered anti-oxidant properties (<LINK REF="REF-Reiter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiter 1995</LINK>). In addition to the brain, there are also melatonin receptors on cells of blood vessels, ovaries and digestive system, though little is currently known about their functions.</P>
<P>Since melatonin is a naturally occurring substance, it is not considered a drug in most countries. However, the safety of melatonin products has not been definitely determined. Melatonin products are regulated differently in several countries. In the United States, melatonin falls under the Food and Drug Administration's Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in the category of "other dietary supplements" and is "generally recognized as safe". In Canada, melatonin is included in the Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada. Melatonin is available for sale in Canada, having met the specific licensing, manufacturing, labelling, and safety standards. In the European Union, melatonin is considered a medicine or hormone and is available only by prescription. In Australia, melatonin is an unregistered product under the Therapeutic Goods administration. However, with a prescription, it can be imported for use under the Personal Import Scheme (<LINK REF="REF-Buscemi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buscemi 2004</LINK>). It should be noted that in situations where manufacture and sale of melatonin is not regulated as a drug, preparations may contain additives that have their own pharmacological actions and potential side effects (e.g. some health food store melatonin preparations are said to contain the same impurity which causes eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome when found in tryptophan preparations) (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dementia is an acquired, persistent global impairment of intellectual function. There are various diagnostic criteria based on demonstration of acquired defects in more than one domain of cognitive function, for example: language, memory, visuo-spatial skills, emotion or personality, abstraction, calculation, judgment or executive function (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>). It is a common affliction, affecting some 8% of adults aged over 65 years, rising to 35% of those older than age 85 years (<LINK REF="REF-CSHA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSHA 1994</LINK>). Research findings have supported the use of drugs to decrease symptoms of dementia-related depression<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2007</LINK>). In addition,<B> </B>exercise and behavior management techniques have been associated with 'improved physical health' and a decrease in symptoms of depression in those with Alzheimer's Disease (<LINK REF="REF-Teri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teri 2003</LINK>). However, to date, there have been few reports of such a relationship between melatonin and cognition,<B> </B>mood and behavior in persons with<B> </B>dementia or the effectiveness of melatonin treatment for dementia-related depression.</P>
<P>There are a number of factors suggesting a relationship between decline of melatonin function and the neuropathology of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2003</LINK>). These include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Decline of serum melatonin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mishima-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishima 1994</LINK>) (to an even greater extent than in normal aging) and the breakdown of normal circadian rhythmicity (<LINK REF="REF-Auger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auger 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghali-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghali 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 1992</LINK>) in persons with dementia. The relationship between melatonin and circadian rhythmicity is well-established. The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the brain are generally accepted as the "seat" of the circadian clock in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swaab-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swaab 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yesavage-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yesavage 2003</LINK>). Entrainment of the SCN (i.e. "setting" of the biological clock) is, in large part, due to rhythmic release of melatonin from the pineal gland (<LINK REF="REF-Dubocovich-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubocovich 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Disruption in sleep patterns in<B> </B>persons with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Prinz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prinz 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2005</LINK>), the relationship between melatonin and sleep patterns (<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webb-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1995</LINK>), and the relationship between sleep and cognitive function i.e. disrupted or insufficient sleep can contribute to significant difficulties with tasks requiring mental concentration and memory function (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downey-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downey 1987</LINK>). This effect is thought to be even more pronounced in people with pre- or co-existing causes of cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 1995</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Correlation between typical areas of cerebral atrophy in certain dementias (e.g. temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease [AD]), and those areas containing melatonin receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Dubocovich-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubocovich 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fauteck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauteck 1995</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Decrease of melatonin production associated with increasing calcification of the pineal gland in persons with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Antioxidant and antiamyloidogenic properties of melatonin (<LINK REF="REF-Pierrefiche-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierrefiche 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reiter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiter 1994</LINK>); and the<I> </I>known involvement of oxidative and amyloid-mediated brain damage in the pathogenesis of AD (<LINK REF="REF-Varadarajan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varadarajan 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Breakdown in normal function of melatonin-related brain functions also may play a significant role in caregivers' ability to care for an individual with dementia. Specifically, problematic sleep-related behaviours often precipitate the decision of families to institutionalize an elderly relative with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Coffey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coffey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yesavage-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yesavage 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally, few adverse effects have been reported in human trials in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Andrade-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buscemi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buscemi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seabra-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seabra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shamir-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shamir 2000</LINK>). However, because of the many organ systems containing melatonin receptors, adverse effects could be far-reaching. Furthermore, a number of studies and animal data suggest a variety of possible side effects including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Worsening of depression (disruption of normal circadian rhythm if not "timed with light therapy and sleep-phase changes") leads to sleep disturbance, weight loss and an oral temperature decrease in those with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Carman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carman 1976</LINK>); also supported by a finding in depressed individuals, but not in controls, of a longer duration of the nocturnal period of active melatonin secretion in winter than in summer (<LINK REF="REF-Wehr-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wehr 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, because evening melatonin should produce a circadian phase advance, it may worsen early morning awakening. However, recent evidence supports the use of melatonin to improve sleep in persons with depression and the use of melatonergic receptor agonists to treat depression and seasonal affective disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasan 2009</LINK>). Melatonin use for sleep disorders is not associated with symptoms of addiction or withdrawal, although the short half life of melatonin may be associated with equivocal sleep effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hardeland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardeland 2008</LINK>). Evidence also supports melatonin treatment for depression<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Detanico-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detanico 2009</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Exogenous melatonin (or its withdrawal) may trigger or worsen manic episodes in susceptible individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Leibenluft-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibenluft 1997</LINK>), although it has also been found to improve sleep and decrease severity of manic symptoms associated with treatment-resistant insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Bersani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bersani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>High doses of melatonin may increase ototoxicity<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Erdem-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erdem 2005</LINK>)<B> </B>and<B> </B>suppress insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 1999</LINK>) although a lack of effect on insulin has also been found (<LINK REF="REF-Bizot_x002d_Espiard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bizot-Espiard 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Exogenous melatonin may reduce glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in post-menopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Cagnacci-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagnacci 2001</LINK>). However, recent evidence supports the use of melatonin to treat non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Kedziora_x002d_Kornatowska-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kedziora-Kornatowska 2009</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Melatonin has been found to increase retinal susceptibility to light-induced damage (<LINK REF="REF-Leino-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leino 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiechmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiechmann 1992</LINK>) but also<I> </I>to protect the retina from oxidative damage (<LINK REF="REF-Siu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siu 1999</LINK>). Improved opthalmic surgical outcomes have been achieved with melatonin to enhance anxiolytic and analgesic effects and to decrease intraocular pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2009</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Melatonin has been reported to have both vasoconstricting (<LINK REF="REF-Mahle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viswanathan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viswanathan 1997</LINK>) and vasorelaxing properties (<LINK REF="REF-Cagnacci-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagnacci 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 1995</LINK>)<I>: </I>it can lower blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Chuang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tom 2001</LINK>) and decrease heart rates in young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Yildiz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yildiz 2009</LINK>)<B>. </B>In animals, melatonin can constrict cerebral and coronary arteries and reduce cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Capsoni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capsoni 1995</LINK>). The arterial effect might account for several reports that melatonin causes headache, although it has also been reported to relieve headache (especially migraine) (<LINK REF="REF-Claustrat-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claustrat 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2001</LINK>). Vasoconstriction could also, theoretically, compromise cerebral circulation in older people with atherosclerosis. However, another study suggests melatonin may diminish the risk of hypoperfusion-induced cerebral ischaemia by shifting the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation to a lower pressure level, improving the cerebrovascular dilatatory reserve, and thus widening the security margin (<LINK REF="REF-Regrigny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regrigny 1998</LINK>). Melatonin also may be effective for use as an anti-convulsant (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munoz_x002d_Hoyos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munoz-Hoyos 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Melatonin appears to enhance immune function (<LINK REF="REF-Maestroni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maestroni 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reiter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiter 2000</LINK>) but may worsen such autoimmune conditions as arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Maestroni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maestroni 2001</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Little attention has been given to the safe and efficacious use of melatonin in populations who are diagnosed with dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>), although the adverse effects of melatonin have been investigated in relation to older adult diabetic population outcomes and cerebral vascular, opthalmic, and anticonvulsant use.<B> </B>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Titles and abstracts of citations obtained from the search were examined by three reviewers (LJ, VD and DF) and obviously irrelevant articles discarded. Articles were retrieved if there was a possibility of inclusion of a relevant randomized controlled trial.</P>
<P>Two authors (LJ, VD) independently assessed retrieved articles for inclusion in the review according to the criteria above. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, or if necessary referred to a third author (DF).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodology and quality</HEADING>
<P>The trial design and risk of bias were assessed by two reviewers based on The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,version 5.0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Appropriate randomization and blind assessment of outcomes<B> </B>were threshold risk of bias criteria for inclusion in the review. In addition, whether individuals<B> </B>or<B> </B>residential site<B> </B>was randomly assigned, whether participants were blind to their treatment allocation, and whether drop-out was judged to be serious enough to be a potential source of bias were assessed for use in sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>Concealment of allocation to treatment was rated by the following three categories:</P>
<P>Category A (adequate) where the report or further clarification from the original author<B> </B>described allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomized scheme; e.g., randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (ii) numbered or coded containers, e.g. in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iii) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (iv) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (v) other combinations of described elements of the process that provided assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate) where the report or further clarification from the original author<B> </B>described allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a "list" or "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or "sealed envelopes"; (iii) stating the study was "randomized" without further detail. </P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) where the report or further clarification from the original author<B> </B>described allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that was transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</P>
<P>Trials were included if they conformed to categories A or B; those falling into category C were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted from published reports or requested from the corresponding author when necessary. Summary statistics were required for each trial and each outcome. For continuous data, the mean change from baseline, the standard deviation of the mean change, and the number of participants for each treatment group at each assessment were extracted. Where changes in means and standard deviations from baseline to end point were not reported, the mean, standard deviation, and the number of participants for each treatment group at each end point were extracted if available.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomization were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data were reported in all trials,<B> </B>therefore, these<B> </B>data were analysed<B> </B>as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (sample size, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each group in each trial for change from baseline. When change from baseline standard deviations were not reported, then only the end point results were used.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis requires the combination of data from the trials. Inverse variance was used as the method of analysis. This method weights studies inversely according to the extent of the study's contribution to the pooled estimate of treatment effect. For example, larger weights are assigned to change scores with smaller standard deviations. The treatment difference for any outcome was the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials used the same rating scale or test to assess an outcome, and the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation, when they used different rating scales or tests. However, meta-analysis was not used to combine scores from different scales when the measures were derived from final endpoint and change scores (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The primary basis for selection of participants in all five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) was the diagnosis of some type of dementia. Two hundred and eighty-nine participants had a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>) or a NINCDS-ADRDA diagnosis of probable AD (<LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>), which represents 86% of the total participants in the five studies. In the fourth study, the participants had to satisfy the <LINK REF="REF-APA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2004</LINK> (1994) criteria for a clinical diagnosis of dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>). Participants had to be physically able to complete the study, which excluded those who had a severe physical disease or problems. Additional study selection information was requested from the authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> study in an email dated 18 July, 2009.<B> </B>However, to date no data has been received.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study recruited 189 residents from homes for the elderly. Forty-six were allocated to a melatonin only treatment group while 45 were allocated to a double placebo group (no melatonin, no bright light). Participants were only excluded if they did not provide consent, or if they used monoamine oxidase inhibitors, long-term nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or had severe liver or kidney dysfunction, and aphakia. Of the 189 participants randomly assigned to the 4 treatment and control arms of the study, "120 (63%) met the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer disease, 20 (11%) met the DSM-IV criteria for vascular dementia, and 24 (13%) met criteria for other types of dementia, including dementia due to multiple etiologies (9 cases), frontal-type dementia (3 cases), Lewy body dementia (2 cases), Parkinson disease (2 cases), Wernicke-Korsakoff (1 case), and dementia not otherwise specified (7 cases). Seventeen participants (8%) did not meet the criteria for dementia but stayed in the group care facility for various medical or psychosocial reasons. In 8 participants, data on medical history were insufficient to reach a reliable clinical diagnosis" (p. 2643).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Four of the studies required that participants be experiencing some type of sleep disturbance (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>). Descriptions of these sleep disturbances were provided in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> included those with AD if they averaged less than 7 hours of sleep per night (as documented by wrist actigraphy), and were noted by the caregiver to experience two or more episodes per week of disturbed night-time sleep, such as sleep latency, wandering, early wakening, and daytime somnolence. <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK> included those with a clinical diagnosis of dementia who demonstrated at least two weekly incidents of night-time agitated behavior as reported by the caregiver.</P>
<P>In all five studies, the Mini-Mental State Examination was administered to establish the severity of dementia both at baseline and the endpoint of the study. In four of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) the mean MMSE scores of participants at baseline ranged from a low of 10.3 to a high of 15.3, falling into the moderate range of cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Tombaugh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tombaugh 1992</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> study, the participants' mean MMSE score was 5.8 falling into the severe range of cognitive impairment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Before intervention with exogenous melatonin occurred, medications were stabilized in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK> study, beta-blockers were washed out for four weeks before the study, while other drugs required by participants were maintained, provided that they did not affect the symptoms of AD. In the <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK> study, participants were either not taking hypnotic medication, or were receiving the same dose of medication for at least four weeks prior to entry into the trial. Psychotropic medication was not used during the study period. The participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> study were excluded from the study if they had been using investigational or unapproved medications within four weeks of the screening visit.The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study was designed to be a 'practical clinical trial', that is, a trial that is designed to investigate the practical issues and positive outcomes of treatment in clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Tunis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunis 2003</LINK>). Hence, no restrictions on medications being started, stopped or changed during the trial period were made. Medication data was not available from the <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> study. This information was requested of the <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> authors by email on 18 July, 2009. To date, no data have been received.</P>
<P>Exogenous melatonin was administered to participants once a day at the participants' usual bedtime (<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>), at one hour prior (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>), at 20:30 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>) or at 10:00 pm (<LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>). The intervention was administered by informal caregivers, researchers, physicians or registered nurses with advanced preparation. Training was provided to all those who administered the intervention. Dosage ranged from 3 to 10 mg of immediate release (IR)<B> </B>melatonin to 1.5 to 6 mg slow release (SR) melatonin. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) divided participants into three groups: the control group, a group which received 2.5 (SR) melatonin, and a group which received 10 mg (IR) melatonin. A 3 mg melatonin treatment was used in the <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK> study. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>) administered 6 mg (SR) melatonin. The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study used 2.5 mg of a &#8220;medium-fast&#8221; release, while the <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> used a 8.5 mg immediate release and 1.5 mg time release preparation.</P>

<P>The primary goal of four of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) was to measure the effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep disorders in participants with cognitive dementia or AD. Primary outcomes in all four studies were measured objectively using wrist actigraphy. Secondary outcomes included changes in cognitive function (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>), non-cognitive function, (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>), depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functions in activities of daily living (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>). Part of the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study also focused on the effects of melatonin on the progression of cognitive symptoms of dementia, changes in psychopathologic behavior including mood,<B> </B>depressive and behavior symptoms, and limitations of activities of daily living.</P>
<P>This review primarily<B> </B>focused on the evaluation of the outcomes related to changes in cognition, mood, behavior, and function in activities of daily living. Other secondary outcomes of interest were quality of life, caregiver stress, morbidity, mortality and length of time to institutionalization. These secondary outcomes were not addressed as they were not examined in the included studies. Data relevant to the safe use of melatonin were investigated by observation and reporting of adverse events in <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> and adverse effects in <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>) but could not be pooled due to the use of different measurement constructs. <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> defined adverse events as "abnormal behavior, ache/pain, falls, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, infection, respiratory/pulmonary symptom, skin/subcutaneous tissue, and urinary symptoms" (p. 898) with an additional notation of fatigue in the placebo group. Adverse effects as defined by <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> included "dizziness, drowsiness, eye complaints, feebleness, headache, hunger, hyperactivity, inability to sleep, irritability, nausea, constipation, pins and needles, stomach ache, sweating, trembling hands, and other complaints" (p. 2653). Mean adverse effect rating data was provided by<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>, although the authors did not provide participant numbers for each of the endpoint data collection points within the melatonin treatment arm.<B> </B>Therefore, the mean number of placebo and melatonin group participants (cumulative number of participants over the 3.5 year study divided by the number of data collection points [n=8]) was used to calculate adverse effect estimates for the<B> </B>

<P>Cognitive changes were measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in all studies. Additionally, the cognitive section of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cognitive) was employed by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) was employed by <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>. Behavioral and mood changes in the participants were measured using: the Agitated Behavior Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Bliwise-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliwise 1983</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) (<LINK REF="REF-Alexopoulos-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexopoulos 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f8_rner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kørner 2006</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ) (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994 </LINK>)in <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufer 2000</LINK>), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Deyn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Deyn 2000</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>, and the ADAS non-cognitive scores (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study also used the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Affect Rating Scale (PGCARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1996</LINK>), the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDowell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDowell 1996</LINK>), and the Multi Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) (<LINK REF="REF-Helmes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helmes 1987</LINK>). Activities of daily living (ADL) in the participants were measured in <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> using the ADL Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Galasko-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galasko 1997</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> using the NI-ADL (nurse informant activities of daily living) (<LINK REF="REF-Brorsson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brorsson 1984</LINK>).

<P>Essential principles of assessing risk of bias in studies considered for inclusion in a systematic review include study design, allocation concealment, blinding of the interventions<B> </B>and outcome assessment and assessment of attrition (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forbes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forbes 2003</LINK>). Selection bias can be addressed through a randomization process that controls for potential confounding factors and comparability of baseline states of the control and intervention groups. Performance bias refers to the systematic differences in the care provided to the participants in the comparison groups resulting from causes other than the intervention. Decreasing these types of bias can be achieved through double blinding techniques where those receiving care and those providing care are unaware of the assigned intervention, and the provision of training to those providing the intervention. Detection bias refers to systematic differences between the comparison groups in assessment of outcomes. Blinding of outcome assessors limits detection bias. The length of the study and characteristics of participants must also be considered in the examination of attrition bias as systematic differences may exist in loss of participants between the comparison groups.</P>

<BR/>Authors of four of the included research studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) were contacted to obtain details of the random allocation and concealment process referred to in the published articles. To date, random allocation and concealment information has not been received from the <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK> authors. The key codes for the double blind allocation sequence in the remaining three studies were not opened until after the data analyses were completed. Pharmaceutical staff in one study labelled the placebo and melatonin medication through a random number treatment order allocation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>) used a computer generated numbering system to achieve randomised allocation to treatment or control group. <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK> also described the evaluation process for the double blind technique employed to address performance bias. Researchers, participants and care providers reported they were unaware of the nature of the drug (melatonin or a placebo) administered during the intervention phase of the research. In the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study, a research assistant external to the research study used a computer random number function to randomly assign six facilities to light treatment, six facilities to placebo light exposure and participants to double blind daily intake of melatonin. <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> reported that randomization and code development were done at the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Unit (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego. Sealed code breakers were delivered to all sites and collected following study completion. A block randomization process was applied to all ADCS study protocols. Four of the studies were rated as adequate for design and allocation concealment to intervention or control group; those who assessed outcomes were also blind to allocation to the intervention or control group (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>). All authors provided information in the publications or as requested by the reviewers detailing the procedures used to train those administering the intervention and cognitive and non-cognitive assessment instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>).

A 4% attrition rate occurred in the three included studies<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gehrman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gehrman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>) with 268 recruited and 257 completing the trials. One hundred percent compliance (n = 20 at baseline and endpoint) with the Mini Mental State Examination was achieved in <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> provided unpublished data indicating a 96% participant compliance rate (4% attrition equal between intervention and control group) (n = 157 at baseline, n = 151 at endpoint) with the administration of the cognitive and non-cognitive assessment instruments used in the study. Attrition was low at the initial six week follow-up stage of the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study (5% attrition rate, n = 91 at baseline, n = 86 at endpoint) and remained equal between the treatment and placebo groups during the three and one half years of the study. However, significant attrition did occur during each six month follow-up due to death and transfer to long term care (54% participation rate at 1 year, n= 49 at endpoint; 21% participation rate at 2 years, n = 19 at endpoint). None of the treatment attrition effect estimates reached significance within the post-hoc sensitivity analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>). In addition, missing data due to death or nursing home placement and inability of the participant to communicate were dummy coded<B> </B>to investigate their possible effects in a 'pattern mixture model'. Missing data was not imputed in the <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> study.</P>

The MMSE mean baseline scores ranged from 10.3 to 15.3, a moderate degree of dementia, as supported by data obtained from the publications of <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>, and upon request from <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK>.

One study reported that essential drug therapy was maintained, however, drugs such as beta-blockers that may affect AD were eliminated four weeks prior to the study (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> also identified that participants were excluded from this study if: (1) they received investigational or unapproved medications within four weeks of the screening visit prior to the study, (2) psychotropic sleep medication was discontinued within two weeks of the screening visit prior to the trial, or (3) melatonin was administered within two weeks of the screening visit. Medications were not altered in the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study in accordance with the design of a practical clinical trial.

<P>Data were pooled from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) based on combination of similar doses (2.5 to 3 mg), duration (4 weeks to 7 weeks) of melatonin in each study, and similarity of the measured constructs for cognition. As the same measurement scale, that is, the MMSE was used to obtain change score (as measured from endpoint to baseline) and final endpoint measures, the data were analyzed using the unstandardized mean (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> psychopathologic and functional endpoint data could not be pooled with the <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> change score data, as the measures were obtained with different scales. Although no consensus appeared to exist in the literature on melatonin dosage, support was found for the efficacy, safety and tolerance of melatonin across a pharmacologic dosage range of 1 - 10 mg in populations without dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Krinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krinsky 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> also reported that therapeutic blood levels were attained with administration of 2.5 mg (SR) and 10 mg (IR) of melatonin in pharmacokinetic studies conducted in elderly healthy subjects and elderly subjects with AD.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:25:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No significant evidence was revealed in this review for the effect of melatonin administration on cognitive impairment associated with dementia and specifically AD. Study estimates for the effect of melatonin on cognition were non-significant for the meta-analysis of MMSE change scores (melatonin 3 mg, 4 weeks at endpoint from baseline; melatonin 2.5 mg, 6 weeks at final endpoint measure; melatonin 2.5 mg (SR), 7 weeks at endpoint from baseline) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).<B> </B>The treatment effect was also non-significant for the combined ADAS-cognitive scores for melatonin 3 mg and melatonin 2.5 mg (SR), measured at 4 and 7 weeks respectively from baseline (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Significant effects were revealed for<B> </B>an improvement in psychopathologic behavior<B> </B>from data analysis of the ADAS non-cognitive scale (3 mg melatonin, 4 week change score from baseline) and the NPI (7 weeks at endpoint from baseline, 2.5 mg melatonin). The only significant findings from analyses of the longitudinal data (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>) was for a deterioration in mood, an undesirable outcome, at the 1 year final endpoint measure of 2.5 mg (SR) melatonin (Philadelphia Geriatric Center Affect Rating Scale positive) (<LINK REF="FIG-24" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 24</LINK>). The remainder of the single study estimates and combined treatment effects for mood, behavior and activities of daily living were non-significant.</P>
<P>Several factors must be examined when considering the strength of the conclusions.</P>
<P>Strength of the conclusions was supported by homogeneity of the overall study sample. Eighty-one percent<B> </B>of the participants in the studies included in the meta-analyses were diagnosed with dementia and were experiencing a moderate degree of this disease. However, the findings may not be applicable to milder or more severe<B> </B>forms of cognitive impairment. The length of time diagnosed with dementia at the time of enrolment (only <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> reported average duration of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) at time of enrolment as 4.9 years, SD 3.0 years) also may have influenced the outcomes.</P>
<P>Other explanations for the non-significant treatment effects may be related to the short time interval of the studies. Since the conditions under evaluation may continue after withdrawal of the treatment, in order to avoid carry-over effects<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), the second three week trial data from the<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 2002</LINK> crossover study were excluded from the review. In addition, differences between treatment and control groups from baseline to end of treatment may be difficult due to small increments of change and may require longer periods of time. The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> study was the only trial which included mixed-effect regression analysis for use with long-term data sets collected over 3.5 years. Several of the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> findings contrasted to the meta-analysis findings of significant melatonin effect for improved psychopathologic behavior and the single estimates of non-significant melatonin effect for a worsening of mood (Philadelphia Geriatric Center Affect Rating Scale negative scores at 6 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years). <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK> found a significant effect for increased withdrawn behavior, an undesirable outcome, from score analyses of the Multi-Observational Scale for Elderly subjects and a significant melatonin effect for a worsening of mood, and an increase in negative mood ratings from analyses of the Philadelphia Geriatric Centre Affect Rating Scale negative scores.Therefore, the meta-analysis did not derive the same mood and behavior data findings as the analyses conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>. Revman software may not capture the findings of a repeated measures design, specifically, the 'interaction effects' that are part of the mixed effect regression analysis . Regression analysis "allowed for inclusion of linear changes over time, and for modification of level (3-level nested structure of the data set), time course, and treatment effect by missing data patterns" (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>, p. 2648). Missing data due to death or nursing home placement and inability of the participant to communicate were dummy coded in this study to investigate their possible effects in a 'pattern mixture model'. Post-hoc sensitivity analysis verified that treatment effects were not affected by the dropout pattern (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies incorporated random allocation to intervention, and blind assessment of outcomes, thus meeting the risk of bias criteria for adequate design, allocation to intervention, performance, detection, and attrition bias. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>) conducted random group assignment to treatment and placebo. However, results of the sensitivity analyses<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) supported the findings of the original meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>).<B> </B>Further efforts were made in all three<B> </B>studies to control for potential confounding variables through exclusion criteria for clinically significant co-morbidity.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the primary goal of two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) was to measure the effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep disorders in participants with dementia or specifically AD. Since all participants<B> </B>in these two studies<B> </B>had a sleep disorder, this<B> </B>may have influenced the outcome scores examined in this review thus limiting the generalizability of the review. <LINK REF="STD-Asayama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Asayama 2003</LINK> proposed that melatonin may indirectly affect cognitive and non-cognitive function through an improved sleep wake rhythm. <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK> discussed the possible hypnotic effect of melatonin.</P>
<P>Several outcomes of interest were not addressed by the included studies. Longer term studies are needed to examine outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, length of time to institutionalization, and caregiver outcomes. Data was collected on adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) and adverse effects associated with the use of melatonin (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>). Data within these two studies were not combined due to the difference in measurement constructs. Single study estimates were not significant for seriousness of adverse events<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) or adverse effects in the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma_x002d_van-der-Lek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma-van der Lek 2008</LINK>). These findings suggest that there was not an increase in occurrence of adverse events and effects in the treatment group and thus, may support the safety of melatonin use. However, meta-analysis of RCT data is required to further investigate the safety of melatonin for the treatment of dementia. </P>

<P>Meta-analysis did not support the use of melatonin for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with dementia. Meta-analysis of data from psychopathologic behavior scales revealed significantly improved outcomes. These results suggest that melatonin treatment may be effective for the treatment of these dementia-related disturbances. Therefore, further research is recommended to investigate the effectiveness of melatonin for the treatment of dementia-related mood symptoms.<B>

<P>Results may be strengthened by additional longitudinal studies that examine the influence of melatonin over an extended time span.<B> </B>In addition, when cross-over designs are used, it is recommended that appropriate paired analysis be conducted and that the data be reported to allow for meta-analysis. Additional single interventions should be tested so that the effects can be clearly attributed to one intervention. Several articles could not be included in the review because of the inability to separate the effects of bright light therapy from melatonin and the non-availability of data for meta-analysis.</P>

<P>MMSE: Short, valid and reliable cognitive assessment tool that can evaluate the severity of dementia and chronological changes in functioning. Eleven task oriented items, key scale categories of orientation, memory and attention. Total attainable score is 30 indicating healthy cognitive status. Concurrent validity supported by correlations with the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale [r = .776 with the Verbal Scale, p &lt; .0001; r = .660 with Performance Scale, p &lt; .001 (Tombaugh 1992)].

<TD>
<P>ADAS-cognitive: Short valid measure of cognitive functional decline associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cognitive Scale (11 items, task oriented, r = .989 p &lt; .001, for interrater reliability, test-retest reliability, r = .915, p &lt; .001: categories include memory, language, recall, word finding difficulty, following commands). Maximum score of 70 indicates marked cognitive symptoms of AD. Significant correlation with the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Score (r = .668, df = 16, p &lt; .01) and total scale score (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>).</P>

<TD>
<P>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) used in Asayma 2003 study.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>CDR: Valid and reliable measure of dementia and cognitive ability. Categories include memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Scale rating score ranges from 0 (healthy) to 3 (severe dementia). Caregivers rate client ability from 1 to 9 (extreme debilitation). Adequate correlations support the reliability of the instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1982</LINK>).</P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) used in Singer 2003 study.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>NPI: Valid measure of psychopathological behavior associated with dementia. Ten dichotomous subscales: constructs of delusions, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, agitation, apathy, irritability/lability, disinhibition and euphoria. Concurrent validity supported by results of correlation with BEHAVE-AD and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Between rater, test-retest, and internal consistency results support reliability of the instrument. Data is obtained from caregivers. A score of 0 to 120 is obtained by multiplying the frequency of each item (rated 1 to 4) by the severity (rated 1 to 3) of each item. Higher score indicates more severe psychopathology (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>).</P>
