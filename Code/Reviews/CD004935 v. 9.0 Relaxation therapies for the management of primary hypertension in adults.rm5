<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Relaxation for high blood pressure in adults which has no clearly identified cause</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The World Health Organisation estimates that high blood pressure leads to over 7 million deaths each year, about 13% of the total deaths worldwide. If people lower their blood pressure, they are less likely to die or to have heart attacks and strokes. If someone's blood pressure is only slightly too high, they may prefer trying to lower it by changing their lifestyle rather than starting on drugs. Although we know that relaxing can counteract the short-term increases in blood pressure that are caused by stress, we don't know if a sustained programme of relaxation can produce long-term reductions in blood pressure or decrease the risk of death, heart attack and stroke.</P>
<P>Our review pooled findings from 1,198 people with blood pressure over 140/85 mmHg who were enrolled in 25 randomised controlled trials. These trials compared the effect of relaxation either with no treatment or with a dummy treatment which wasn't expected to reduce blood pressure. Overall, relaxation reduced blood pressure by a small amount: the average reduction was 5/3 mmHg, but might be anywhere between 8/5 mmHg and 3/2 mmHg. Different trials gave different &#8722; sometimes inconsistent &#8722; results. Many of the trials were not well designed or conducted. In the good quality trials, relaxation resulted in smaller average reductions in blood pressure and the results could even be consistent with an average increase in blood pressure. Even when all the trials were put together, the combined group of all the people in all the trials wasn't large enough and the trials didn't run for long enough to tell us whether relaxation could reduce the risk of death, heart attack or stroke. Few people reported side-effects of relaxation and, on average, people were just as likely to report side-effects of the comparison treatment.</P>
<P>Different types of relaxation were taught in different trials. It was difficult to disentangle their effects, especially as many trials used a combination of methods. Overall, we found no evidence that autogenic training was effective. Progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive/behavioural therapies and biofeedback seemed to be more likely to reduce blood pressure. However, some of the reduction in blood pressure was almost certainly due to aspects of treatment that were not related to relaxation, such as frequent contact with professionals who were trying to help.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lifestyle interventions are often recommended as initial treatment for mild hypertension, but the efficacy of relaxation therapies is unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of relaxation therapies on cardiovascular outcomes and blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Inclusion criteria: RCTs of a parallel design comparing relaxation therapies with no active treatment, or sham therapy; follow-up &#8805;8 weeks; participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#8805;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#8805;85 mmHg); SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. Exclusion criteria: participants were pregnant; participants received antihypertensive medication which changed during the trial.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>29 RCTs, with eight weeks to five years follow-up, met our inclusion criteria; four were excluded from the primary meta-analysis because of inadequate outcome data. The remaining 25 trials assessed 1,198 participants, but adequate randomisation was confirmed in only seven trials and concealment of allocation in only one. Only one trial reported deaths, heart attacks and strokes (one of each). Meta-analysis indicated that relaxation resulted in small, statistically significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: -5.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.2 to -2.8, I2 =72%) and DBP (mean difference: -3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.3 to -1.6, I2 =75%) compared to control. The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by duration of follow-up, type of control, type of relaxation therapy or baseline blood pressure.</P>
<P>The nine trials that reported blinding of outcome assessors found a non-significant net reduction in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.7 to 1.4, I<SUP>2</SUP> =69%) associated with relaxation. The 15 trials comparing relaxation with sham therapy likewise found a non-significant reduction in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.1 to 0.2, I<SUP>2</SUP> =63%). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In view of the poor quality of included trials and unexplained variation between trials, the evidence in favour of causal association between relaxation and blood pressure reduction is weak. Some of the apparent benefit of relaxation was probably due to aspects of treatment unrelated to relaxation.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>High blood pressure (BP), or hypertension, is associated with a variety of structural changes in the blood vessels and heart which can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal diseases. It is one of the ten leading risk factors influencing the global burden of disease and is estimated to lead to over 7 million deaths each year, about 13% of the total deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Reducing blood pressure levels is associated with significant reduction in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-PSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSC 2002</LINK>). The most common form of hypertension, occurring in around 95% of all cases, is primary hypertension which is defined as high blood pressure with no identifiable cause (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>). Secondary hypertension is high blood pressure with an identifiable cause, e.g. renal disease or endocrine disturbances. </P>
<P>There is substantial evidence that stress can lead to short term elevation of blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 1998</LINK>). The physiological response to a stressor can be described by a three stage model: a short-term alarm reaction ('fight or flight') where the body responds to a stressor with sympathetic nervous system activity leading to increased blood pressure; resistance reaction where the body continues to fight the stressor after the initial alarm reaction passes; finally, exhaustion occurs if the body is unable to maintain this resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, hypertension is a physical symptom of the exhaustion stage when the body cannot maintain resistance to a stressor (<LINK REF="REF-von-Onciul-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Onciul 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>While short term stress can lead to elevated blood pressure, the relevance of this to sustained hypertension remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 1991</LINK>). Although some researchers have observed higher blood pressure while people were at work than when they were at home and others have reported an association between systolic blood pressure and the perception of having a stressful job, no strong epidemiological evidence exists for an association between stress and sustained hypertension. The physiological mechanisms that might link stress to the development of sustained hypertension are unclear. Long term hypertension may be caused by separate factors from those which cause short term elevation of blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2003</LINK>). While short term blood pressure elevation can be attributed to sympathetic nervous system activity, long term changes may be perpetuated by vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>A number of heterogeneous therapies that aim to reduce stress and encourage relaxation have been investigated for the treatment of hypertension. The relaxation response<I> </I>is the opposite of the fight or flight phenomenon; it reduces blood pressure and lessens the harmful effects of stress (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1984</LINK>). It is often elicited by repetition of a word or phrase, while adopting a passive attitude and decreased muscular tone (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>). <I>Autogenic training</I> is a relaxation technique focusing on physical sensations of e.g. breathing or heartbeat, assisted by self-suggestion (<LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK>). It aims to elicit the relaxation response through repetitive mental focus and adoption of a passive attitude (<LINK REF="REF-Mandle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandle 1996</LINK>). <I>Cognitive therapy</I> teaches the individual to recognise and change irrational thought processes behind problematic emotions and so may modify the individual's response to stress (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 2003</LINK>). <I>Behavioural therapy </I>uses reinforcements (e.g. rewarding or not rewarding specific behaviours) to change or elicit desired behavioural responses and so may likewise be useful in helping people deal with stress (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 2003</LINK>). <I>Meditation</I> includes various techniques for focusing the individual's attention and calming their thoughts (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 2003</LINK>). <I>Guided imagery </I>requires the individual to focus on calming images with the goal of achieving relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 2003</LINK>). <I>Biofeedback </I>is a therapeutic procedure where the individual is trained to alter a physiological response (e.g. blood pressure) through receiving visual or auditory feedback about the response (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 2003</LINK>). <I>Progressive muscle relaxation</I> encourages relaxation through awareness of the sensation in the main muscle groups and is often accompanied by breathing exercises and guided imagery (<LINK REF="REF-Huntley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huntley 2002</LINK>). <I>Breathing exercises</I> require the individual to maintain slow and regular breathing which may directly influence the cardiovascular system (Grossman 2001). <I>Yoga </I>techniques usually include stretching, postural and breathing exercises and meditation (<LINK REF="REF-Engbretson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engbretson 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>We found five previous systematic reviews which included meta-analyses of a variety of relaxation therapies for treating hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK>). These meta-analyses require updating, for several reasons. Firstly, although the earlier meta-analyses ( <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>) considered a range of relaxation therapies, the recent meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK>) were restricted to autogenic training and biofeedback respectively. Secondly, these reviews provided conflicting evidence. <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK> aggregated studies of a variety of relaxation therapies and found that relaxation was associated with a very small overall reduction of 1/1 mmHg in blood pressure. <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK> found that relaxation was superior to no treatment but not to a credible sham therapy. <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK> found similar results for biofeedback. <LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK> found relaxation therapies were effective in reducing blood pressure. <LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK> found autogenic training to be more effective than sham therapy for mild-to-moderate primary hypertension. Thirdly, only one of these meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>) was restricted to studies with a minimum length of follow up (6 months); the meta-analyses of <LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK> included trials which lasted only two and three weeks respectively; those of <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK> did not report length of follow-up. Since treatment for hypertension is likely to be a life-long process, short-term studies may not be relevant to establishing the benefits of long-term treatment. Finally, some types of relaxation therapies may be effective in reducing blood pressure, while others may not (<LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>). Therefore there is a need for an up-to-date review of all relaxation treatments for lowering raised blood pressure, which excludes short-term studies and considers the possible differences between the effects of different therapies.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence about the benefits and harms of relaxation therapies for patients with primary hypertension, in order to inform decisions about recommendations for treatment.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of a parallel design that had an intervention period of at least 8 weeks and allowed an intention-to-treat analysis; "intention-to-treat" was interpreted as meaning that participants were analysed in the treatment groups to which they were assigned (see section 8.4.1 of <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>)</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults over 18 years of age, with elevated blood pressure (a minimum of 140 mmHg for SBP or 85 mmHg for DBP), without a known primary cause. The inclusion criterion for diastolic blood pressure is slightly lower than the standard (90 mmHg) for hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-JNC-VII-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC VII 2003</LINK>), in order to include individuals at the lower end of the spectrum of raised blood pressure. <BR/>We excluded:<BR/>

<LI>studies of pregnant women, since hypertension during pregnancy is often due to syndromes such as preeclampsia, with a pathophysiology very different from that of other forms of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>studies including participants on antihypertensive medication which was allowed to vary during the course of the study, since the results of such studies are difficult to interpret. </LI>

<BR/>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were screened independently by two reviewers and those studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Copies of the full text of potentially relevant references were obtained and their eligibility was assessed by one of two methods: one reviewer was primary assessor and decisions were checked by a second reviewer or assessments were done independently by two reviewers. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion or by appeal to a third reviewer. </P>

<U>Quality assessment</U>
</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality of included trials was assessed independently by two reviewers using the following criteria:</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>We coded the blinding of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes</LI>
<LI>no</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Randomisation</B>
<BR/>We coded the randomisation of participants to intervention groups as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate e.g. a computer-generated random sequence or a table of random numbers;</LI>
<LI>inadequate e.g. date of birth, clinic id-number or surname;</LI>
<LI>unclear e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>We coded the concealment of allocation sequence from treatment providers and participants as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (A) i.e. where the allocation sequence could not be foretold;</LI>
<LI>inadequate (B) e.g. a method of allocation which allowed treatment providers to predict which arm of the trial the next participant was assigned to;</LI>
<LI>unclear (C) e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Loss to follow-up</B>
<BR/>We recorded the number of participants in each intervention arm whose blood pressure was not reported at the end of the study. We noted if loss to follow-up was not reported.</P>
<P>Two reviewers independently abstracted endpoint data and data describing the trial quality, study population (country in which the study was conducted, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline: age, gender, ethnicity, mean blood pressure, whether previously treated with antihypertensive drugs), and interventions (treatment provider, type of relaxation therapy; duration of intervention and follow-up) using a pre-specified form. Differences were reconciled by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. All corresponding authors were contacted for missing endpoint data: three replied supplying us with unpublished data (<LINK REF="STD-Canino-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Canino 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murugasan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Murugasan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schein 2001</LINK>); two letters were returned as they did not reach the intended recipient; one author replied but was unable to supply the requested data.</P>
<P>We categorised the components of active interventions as: biofeedback; cognitive/behavioural therapy (including meditation, yoga and guided imagery); progressive muscle relaxation, or autogenic training.</P>

</B>The findings of included trials were aggregated in meta-analyses using Review Manager 4.2.8. </P>
<P>We planned to meta-analyse deaths, heart attacks and strokes, if more than one trial reported the outcome, by calculating a relative risk for each outcome for each trial and combining these using a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>For blood pressure, the mean difference (and standard deviation) between final blood pressure for relaxation and control interventions for both SBP and DBP was calculated. If standard deviations of final values were not available, change scores were used if their standard deviations were available. If trials had more than one treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Achmon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Achmon 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafner-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hafner 1982</LINK>), we used a weighted mean of the outcome for all treatment arms; for trials with more than one control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Canino-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Canino 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frankel-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Frankel 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LaGrone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">LaGrone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seer-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Seer 1980</LINK>) we likewise used a weighted mean of the outcome for all control arms. Mean differences were weighted according to the precision of each trial and combined in meta-analyses using a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>), to estimate an overall pooled mean difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Sub-group analyses were performed grouping the trials by:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>duration of follow-up: &lt;6 months; 6 months and over;</LI>
<LI>type of control: sham therapy, no active treatment; </LI>
<LI>whether the active intervention included: biofeedback, cognitive/behavioural therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training. </LI>
</UL>
<P>For trials with two control arms (both sham therapy and no active treatment: <LINK REF="STD-Canino-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Canino 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frankel-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Frankel 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seer-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Seer 1980</LINK>), these sub-group analyses compared half of the participants in the treatment group with the sham therapy group and half with the no active treatment control group. Likewise, for trials with two active intervention arms of different types (<LINK REF="STD-Achmon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Achmon 1989</LINK>), half the participants in the control group were compared with one active intervention arm and half with the other.</P>
<P>Although not specified in the original protocol, trials were also sub-grouped by whether the initial mean blood pressure among participants was above or below the median for all trials, as it seemed plausible that trials in which participants had a higher initial blood pressure would be more likely to show an effect of relaxation. Additionally, the comparison of biofeedback with control was sub-grouped by type of control (sham therapy/no active treatment) for comparison with the systematic review of <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding trials which did not report (i) adequate concealment of allocation, (ii) blinding of the outcome assessor. Further sensitivity analyses were performed imputing standard deviations to those trials for which they were unavailable, using the highest and lowest SBP and DBP standard deviations for intervention and control in the primary meta-analysis. </P>
<P>We assessed the tolerability of the intervention by calculating the difference in the rate of withdrawal in treatment and control arms, using a random effects model to calculate a pooled risk difference. We used the same methods to assess adverse events.</P>

<U>Identification of included studies</U>
</B>
<BR/>The search strategy found 2,404 potentially relevant references which we electronically screened (see Additional Figures: <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We excluded 2,260 references and retrieved 144 references, describing 134 studies, for detailed evaluation. We excluded 105 of these studies for the following reasons: not randomised (27 trials); antihypertensive medication varied during the trial (21 trials); normotensive participants (17 trials); unclear if participants were normotensive or hypertensive (1 trial), no control group (13 trials); less than 8 weeks follow-up (12 trials); no outcome BP reported (6 trials); data allowing an intention to treat analysis not reported (4 trials); participants were children (1 trial); comment/editorial (1 study); no control group outcome BP reported (1 trial); crossover design (1 trial) - see<B> </B>table<B> </B>

</B>) included other arms which were not considered in this review. One trial was a 2 X 2 factorial trial (<LINK REF="STD-Adsett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Adsett 1989</LINK>), so we aggregated the relaxation intervention and control over the other interventions (&#946;-blocker and placebo). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1996</LINK>) randomised communities rather than individuals, so the numbers of participants were adjusted to allow for this cluster randomisation (see section 8.11.2.2 of <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>). </P>

Imputing the highest standard deviations, this meta-analysis of 28 trials, assessing 1,330 participants, found statistically significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference: -5.7 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.4 to -3.1) and DBP (mean difference: -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.6 to -2.0), confirming the findings of the primary analysis. Imputing the lowest standard deviations, similar results were obtained for SBP (mean difference: -5.9 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.7 to -3.1) and DBP (mean difference: -4.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.0 to -2.1). <BR/>

<BR/>The one trial which reported adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1988</LINK>) compared an active intervention which combined progressive muscle relaxation and biofeedback with no intervention. It enrolled 134 participants of whom 31 (23%) were lost to follow-up. Based on the reported change scores, we estimated that relaxation was associated with statistically significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference: -12.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -17.8 to -6.2) and DBP (mean difference: -4.1 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.4 to -0.9) compared to control. However, participants in the relaxation group had a significantly higher baseline BP (145/89 mmHg) than those in the control group (136/86 mmHg). This baseline imbalance was thoroughly considered by the trial investigators and remained after including and excluding various sub-groups of participants and also when comparing blood pressure readings taken prior to the baseline measurement. Because of the differences in initial blood pressure, the investigators carried out an analysis of covariance which adjusted for differences in blood pressure at entry. This analysis found relaxation was associated with net reductions in both SBP (mean difference: -7.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -12.6 to -2.0) and DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.2 to 0.7) which were less marked than those which we found and statistically significant only for SBP.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>
<U>Summary of findings</U>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The primary meta-analysis of 25 randomised controlled trials assessing 1,198 participants, with between eight weeks and 5 years follow-up, found that interventions to promote relaxation were associated with a small, statistically significant reduction in both SBP and DBP. The random effects model which we used assumes that the effect of treatment differs in different populations but that these effects cluster around a mean: this estimated mean was a reduction in SBP of 5.5 mmHg, (95% CI: 2.8 to 8.2) in participants receiving a relaxation intervention compared to those receiving a control intervention, with a concomitant reduction in DBP of 3.5 mmHg (95% CI: 1.6 to 5.3). However, this estimated reduction of 5/3 mmHg is probably an over-estimate of the effect of relaxation, as poor quality trials and comparisons with non-intervention controls generally over-estimate the effects of treatment, as discussed below. The combined sample was too small and the trials were too short-term to assess whether relaxation could reduce the risk of death, heart attack or stroke.</P>
<P>When relaxation was compared with a sham therapy &#8722; designed to mimic many of the components of the active treatment, but not the component thought to be effective &#8722; the mean reductions in blood pressure were smaller and not statistically significant. This is consistent with the evidence that sham therapy alone can reduce a continuous outcome by between 0.2 and 0.5 standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-Hrobjartsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrobjartsson 2001</LINK>), possibly due to therapeutic effects of the relationship between the participant and the treatment provider. Hence it seems likely that the actual effect of relaxation on blood pressure is less marked than estimated by our primary meta-analysis. </P>
<P>Most included trials were not of good quality. Inadequate concealment of allocation and lack of blinding are often associated with an exaggeration of the effects of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Restriction to the nine trials (assessing 498 participants) that reported blinding of the outcome assessor resulted in mean reductions in SBP and DBP which were smaller than those estimated by the primary meta-analysis and not statistically significant. The one included trial (assessing 103 participants) that reported adequate concealment of allocation yielded results which were similar to the primary meta-analysis, but this trial did not blind outcome assessors. </P>
<P>Progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation with biofeedback and cognitive/behavioural therapies (such as teaching strategies for stress management and anger control) were all associated with statistically significant net reductions in blood pressure. As biofeedback was most frequently used in combination with progressive muscle relaxation, it is unclear which strategy &#8722; or if only the combined strategies &#8722; might be effective. We found little evidence that autogenic training reduced blood pressure. </P>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity between the estimated effects of relaxation in the various trials: between 70% and 80% of the variation between trials could not be explained by sampling variation. This heterogeneity does not appear to be due to bias in outcome assessment, as trials which blinded outcome assessors showed a comparable level of heterogeneity. Nor does it appear to be due to differential withdrawal from treatment or loss to follow-up, which was similar in treatment and control groups. Some possible factors &#8722; duration of follow-up, type of control, initial blood pressure and type of relaxation therapy &#8722; were evaluated by sub-group analyses but, for each factor considered, the treatment effects in the sub-groups were not significantly different and moderate or substantial heterogeneity remained within each sub-group. Therefore other, unidentified factors must largely explain the variation in findings of trials; this is not surprising, given the differences in the active and control interventions used and the differences between participants enrolled in the different trials &#8722; individuals may vary substantially in how they respond to relaxation therapy.</P>
<P>Funnel plots showed little evidence of publication bias. The rates of adverse events, withdrawal from treatment for any reason and withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events were similar in relaxation and control groups. The proportion of participants lost to follow-up was similar in relaxation and control groups and so loss to follow-up is unlikely to have introduced bias in the estimated effect of relaxation. <B>

<B>
<U>Strengths and weaknesses of review</U>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The review was limited by the design of the included trials. As many trials used a combination of strategies to encourage relaxation, it is difficult to ascribe the outcomes to specific components of the therapy. We were not able to evaluate whether the effects of different components were additive.</P>
<P>Some trials that used several relaxation strategies in the active intervention also used the components of these strategies which were thought to be ineffective in lowering blood pressure as the control intervention (i.e. sham therapy); this is a valid design for evaluating the relaxation strategy hypothesised to be effective, despite the use of components of these sham therapies as active interventions in other trials.</P>
<P>
<I>External validity</I>
<BR/>Trials that are conducted in tightly controlled research environments may yield results which are not relevant to real life clinical situations. This aspect of trials may be assessed by whether the setting, the patients recruited, the people delivering the intervention, their training and support and the monitoring of the participants are representative of clinical practice or of a research setting. Although lifestyle interventions for mild-to-moderate hypertension are likely to be of most interest to patients in primary care, only four trials were performed in primary care settings. Furthermore, only 11 trials recruited participants from primary care settings, through primary care physicians, the workplace, or community screening. These participants usually had mild hypertension: many trials excluded patients with heart or renal disease, previous heart attacks or strokes, angina, diabetes and other serious medical disorders. Most of these trials used therapists, physicians or nurses to deliver the intervention, but a few (<LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1991</LINK>) used researchers. The intervention was usually delivered in weekly group sessions lasting between 30 minutes and an hour, but some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Vera-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Vera 1997</LINK>; Irvine 1991; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1996</LINK>) treated participants individually. Participants were usually monitored at baseline, the end of treatment and the end of follow-up, but in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 1996</LINK>) ten physician sites volunteered to monitor patients' blood pressure free of charge. Hence fewer than half the included trials were typical of routine clinical practice. </P>
<P>None of the included trials reported the costs of implementing the intervention, although the excluded trial of <LINK REF="STD-Patel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1981</LINK> reported that providers of relaxation therapy spent a total time of less than an hour per participant during an eight week course. </P>
<P>We divided the trials into two sub-groups in eight different ways and compared two outcomes (SBP and DBP) in each of these sub-groups. Therefore many hypothesis tests were performed on the same set of trials and it is likely that one or two of these appeared to be statistically significant just by chance (see section 8.8.1 of <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<I>Use of antihypertensive medication</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>We excluded from our review 21 trials in which participants were taking antihypertensive medication which could vary during the course of the trial. If relaxation were effective in reducing blood pressure and changes in antihypertensive medication were allowed, it is likely that a higher proportion of participants in the control group than the relaxation group would start on or increase their dose of antihypertensive medication. As antihypertensive drugs generally have a much more marked effect in lowering blood pressure - typically of the order of 9/5 mmHg for single drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>) - than the effect postulated for relaxation, the inclusion of trials allowing such medication could result in an under-estimate of the real effect of relaxation. Although exclusion of such trials is likely to yield a less biased estimate of the effect of relaxation, it will also result in a wider confidence interval for the estimated effect due to the smaller number of included trials. Hence the decision about whether to include or exclude trials that allow antihypertensive medication to vary is essentially a trade-off between bias and precision. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The efficacy of relaxation in the management of hypertension could best be assessed by trials which are long enough and large enough to detect a difference between relaxation and control arms in deaths and cardiovascular events. However, such long and large trials are more likely to allow participants to start on antihypertensive medication, or increase an existing dose; indeed it would not be ethical in such trials to withhold such medication. Hence the decision to exclude from review trials which allow antihypertensive medication to vary may have resulted in exclusion of some potentially informative studies. </P>
<P>In particular, the excluded trial of <LINK REF="STD-Patel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1981</LINK> enrolled 204 currently untreated participants, followed them up for 4 years and reported deaths and cardiovascular events. Although it allowed participants to start taking antihypertensive medication, about the same proportion did so in the relaxation and control groups (18% and 20% respectively), so this is unlikely to have resulted in bias. However, it was similar in design to the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Patel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1988</LINK> in that it did not have an active control group or blinding of outcome assessors; it reported a similar reduction in blood pressure in the relaxation group. </P>
<P>The difficulties of obtaining an unbiased estimate of the effect of relaxation treatment on blood pressure when some participants use varying doses of antihypertensive medication could be addressed by modification to the design of trials. Trial protocols could exclude participants if they start on (or change their dose of) antihypertensive medication, but include their last blood pressure measurements before exclusion. Alternatively, in large trials the efficacy of relaxation could be evaluated by survival analysis, treating starting on (or increasing) antihypertensive medication as a failure, with death and cardiovascular events as competing risks (<LINK REF="REF-Collett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collett 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Comparison with other meta-analyses</U>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Five major meta-analyses of RCTs of relaxation therapies for hypertension have been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK>). These included different trials from our review because of the different time period for reporting of trials, different inclusion criteria, different judgements about whether individual trials were randomised, controlled and maintained any antihypertensive medication at a constant dose. They also used different methods of analysis: in particular, all analysed change scores whereas we preferred final values, since the difference between change scores in treatment and control groups is a biased estimator of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Three meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK>) used weighted mean difference methods, as our review did. Although they used different methods in other aspects of their meta-analyses, they obtained similar results to our review:</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of follow-up</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK> reported the findings of a fixed effects model used to aggregate the results of eight RCTs (six of which were included in our meta-analyses) that had at least 6 months follow-up and were conducted in hypertensive people aged 45 years or over; the threshold for hypertension was not defined. This meta-analysis found that relaxation was associated with a very small overall reduction of 1/1 mmHg in blood pressure. When we restricted our meta-analysis to the 12 studies with at least 6 months follow-up, we found similar small reductions in SBP and DBP (mean differences of -4.0 mmHg, 95%CI: -7.6 to -0.5 and -1.9 mmHg, 95%CI: -3.8 to -0.1 respectively). </P>
<P>
<B>Sham therapy/non-intervention controls</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK> used a random effects model to aggregate the findings of 26 RCTs (12 of which were included in our meta-analyses) in people with DBP between 90 and 114 mmHg. This meta-analysis found that relaxation therapies were superior to no treatment but not to a credible sham therapy. This is consistent with our findings of significant overall reductions in blood pressure in 13 trials which compared relaxation with non-intervention controls, but smaller non-significant reductions in blood pressure in 15 trials which compared relaxation with sham therapy. </P>
<P>This meta-analysis also reported that trials in which baseline blood pressure assessments were made during a period of a day or less found, on average, much larger net reductions in blood pressure than those with longer baseline periods. </P>
<P>
<B>Biofeedback</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK> used a random effects model to aggregate the findings of 22 RCTs (11 of which were included in our meta-analyses) of biofeedback in people with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg. This meta-analysis found that biofeedback was superior to no treatment but not to a credible sham therapy. We found significant overall reductions in both SBP and DBP for six trials which compared biofeedback with non-intervention controls and similar reductions &#8722; significant for SBP but not for DBP &#8722; for eight trials which compared biofeedback with sham therapy respectively. Our results differed from those of <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK> largely because of a different classification of the treatment and control groups in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Achmon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Achmon 1989</LINK>, which reported very large reductions in blood pressure (24/13 mmHg) in the biofeedback group compared to the control group. </P>
<P>
<B>Autogenic training</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Stetter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetter 2002</LINK> used standardised mean difference methods which assume that all the variability between trials is due to differences in the measurement scale and that all trials have a similar amount of natural variation, which may not be true. As blood pressure was measured on the same scale in all trials, we would argue that weighted mean difference methods should be preferred. Stetter's review aggregated findings of four RCTs (one of which was included in our meta-analyses) of autogenic training for mild-to-moderate primary hypertension and found that it significantly reduced blood pressure immediately after treatment. However, based on three RCTs, Stetter's meta-analysis found &#8722; as our review did &#8722; that autogenic training had no significant effect on hypertension at the end of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Linden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 1994</LINK> meta-analysed the change in blood pressure between baseline and end of follow-up in participants who received a relaxation intervention, but did not compare this change score with that in a control group. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Biological plausibility</B>
</P>
<P>Blood pressure is determined by the rate of blood flow produced by the heart, blood volume and the resistance of the blood vessels, which is produced mainly in the small arteries and is known as peripheral vascular resistance. The physiological regulation of blood pressure is complex, resulting from actions of the kidneys, central and autonomic nervous systems, hypothalamic pituitary axis, vascular endothelium and other pathways. Acute rises in blood pressure due to stress are thought to result from the action of adrenaline on the sympathetic nervous system. Furthermore, it has been suggested that adrenaline produced in the acute phase may be stored and released over a more sustained period (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1976</LINK>). However, it is more plausible that chronic hypertension is mediated by factors which increase peripheral vascular resistance. Vascular remodelling, involving changes in blood vessel architecture, endothelial dysfunction and alterations in renal regulation of fluid balance, through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, are thought to be key components of this process (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2003</LINK>). In addition, modulation of glucocorticoid activity may also have a role (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 1991</LINK>). It is likely that these systems do not work in isolation but are interlinked by complex feedback mechanisms. <BR/>
<BR/>Behavioural methods of relaxation therapy aimed to reduce blood pressure through direct control of either the blood pressure or the physiological processes involved in its regulation, whereas psychotherapeutic methods aimed to alter reactions to stress, thus indirectly lowering blood pressure. It is possible that stress reduction could work as a long-term strategy to decrease blood pressure through effects on known blood pressure regulatory mechanisms, for example through decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity or plasma concentrations of cortisol and aldosterone (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1981" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1981</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In view of the poor methodological quality of studies included in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the efficacy or lack of efficacy of relaxation techniques for primary hypertension.</P>
<P>Some relaxation therapies may reduce blood pressure by a small amount in some patients. There was substantial variation between the effects of relaxation therapies in different populations and we were unable to identify the characteristics of patients in whom it was likely to be effective. Some of the reduction in blood pressure apparently associated with relaxation is probably due to the non-specific effects of treatment, such as frequent contact with treatment providers. Progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback and cognitive/behavioural therapies were the relaxation therapies most likely to be effective; there was little evidence that autogenic training was effective. </P>
<P>Even if relaxation results in a reduction in blood pressure, the average reduction is probably less than 5/3 mmHg. We found no direct evidence that relaxation decreases the risk of morbidity and mortality. In contrast, drugs can singly reduce SBP by about 9.1 mmHg (95%CI: 8.8 to 9.3) and DBP by about 5.5 mmHg (95%CI: 5.4 to 5.7) (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>), and are known to have sustained and consistent effects and to reduce morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2003</LINK>). However, as hypertension is a common condition, even small changes in blood pressure in a large proportion of the population could prevent a large number of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-PSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSC 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Since there is no good evidence that relaxation therapies result in meaningful reductions in blood pressure, patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension who prefer non-pharmacological interventions may wish to consider alternative strategies - such as diet, exercise, and restriction of intake of alcohol and salt - which result, on average, in small reductions in blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_rgens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jrgens 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1998</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Despite calls since 1978 for improvements in the methodological quality of trials of relaxation for hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canino-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Canino 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frankel-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Frankel 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacob-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jacob 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakao 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seer-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Seer 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Canter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canter 2004</LINK>), in particular for larger sample sizes from representative populations, longer baseline periods for screening of potential participants, control "placebo" treatments that simulate the non-specific aspects of treatment, control of antihypertensive medication used by participants and blinding of outcome assessors, all the trials contributing to the evidence base were methodologically flawed. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated relaxation in settings such as primary care practices, community services or workplaces which are relevant to routine implementation. </P>
<P>Any future research should address the basic methodological issues, focus on primary care settings and use a design which deals with possible changes in levels of antihypertensive medication in an appropriate way.</P>
