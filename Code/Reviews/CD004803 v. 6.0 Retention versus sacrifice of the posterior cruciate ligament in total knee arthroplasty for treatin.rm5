<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-13 11:24:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration have conducted a review of two types of knee replacement surgery for people with knee osteoarthritis. In one type, the posterior cruciate ligament is kept and in the other, it is removed. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 17 studies with up to 1810 patients.</P>
<P>
<B>The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved during total knee replacement surgery:</B>
</P>
<P>- this may not improve their range of motion, pain, function and patient satisfaction compared with removing the ligament.</P>
<P>We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, especially rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include infection, pain, and the need to have further surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>What is osteoarthritis and what is the posterior cruciate ligament?</B>
</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone may grow abnormally to try and repair the damage and make things worse. For example, it can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee.</P>
<P>In some people, damage and pain in the knee from arthritis may be severe enough to require surgery. In total knee replacement surgery, a surgeon removes the damaged joint surface and replaces it with a metal and plastic implant.</P>
<P>The posterior cruciate ligament provides support and stable movement of the knee. In total knee replacement surgery, the posterior cruciate ligament can be kept in place or removed. This choice depends on the condition of the ligament, the type of total knee replacement selected or preference of the surgeon. When the ligament is removed, a special peg is used to provide stability and give your knee forward and backward movement with the tibia stabilised in relation to the femur.</P>
<P>
<B>What happens to people who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed during total knee replacement surgery</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Range of motion </B>(range of motion is the distance your knee can move from being bent to being fully extended. A lower range of motion is worse; you can&#8217;t bend or stretch your knee fully)</P>
<P>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had 2 ° less range of motion compared to those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance <BR/>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed had a range of motion of 118 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 °<BR/>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had a range of motion of 116 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 °</P>
<P>
<B>Knee pain (lower score means worse pain)</B>
</P>
<P>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their pain to be the same as those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance</P>
<P>
<I>- </I>People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their pain to be 48 on a scale of 0 to 50</P>
<P>
<B>Health related quality of life and functional measures (higher means worse)</B>
</P>
<P>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 1 point worse than those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance</P>
<P>
<I>- </I>People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 16 on a scale of 0 to 100</P>
<P>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed rated their quality of life to be 15 on a scale of 0 to 100</P>
<P>
<B>Patient satisfaction (lower means worse)</B>
</P>
<P>- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their satisfaction the same as those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance</P>
<P>
<I>-</I> People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their satisfaction to be 8 on a scale of 0 to 10</P>
<P>
<B>Complications and the need to have further surgery</B>

<P>The functional and clinical basis on which to choose whether or not to retain the posterior cruciate ligament during total knee arthroplasty surgery remained unclear after a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis in 2005, which contained eight clinical trials. Several new trials have been conducted since then. Hence, an update of the review was performed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-12-20 06:36:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our aim was to assess the benefits and harms of retention compared to sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:35:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An extensive search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Current Contents Connect and Science Direct. All databases were searched, without any limitations, up to 6 December 2012. References of the articles were checked and citation tracking was performed.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-18 02:33:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing retention with sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:36:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were collected with a pre-developed form. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors (WV, LB). The level of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach. Meta-analysis was performed by pooling the results of the selected studies, when possible. Subgroup analyses were performed for posterior cruciate ligament retention versus sacrifice using the same total knee arthroplasty design, and for studies using a posterior cruciate ligament retaining or posterior stabilised design, and when sufficient studies were available subgroup analyses were performed for the same brand.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:52:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventeen randomised controlled trials (with 1810 patients and 2206 knees) were found, described in 18 articles. Ten of these were new studies compared to the previous Cochrane Review. One study from the original Cochrane review was excluded. Most new studies compared a posterior cruciate ligament retaining design with a posterior stabilised design, in which the posterior cruciate ligament is sacrificed (a posterior stabilised design has an insert with a central post which can engage on a femoral cam during flexion).</P>
<P>The quality of evidence (graded with the GRADE approach) and the risk of bias were highly variable, ranging from moderate to low quality evidence and with unclear or low risk of bias for most domains, respectively.</P>
<P>The performance outcome 'range of motion' was 2.4 ° higher in favour of posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice (118.3 ° versus 115.9 °; 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference 0.13 to 4.67; P = 0.04), however the results were heterogeneous. On the item 'knee pain' as experienced by patients, meta-analysis could be performed on the Knee Society knee pain score; this score was 48.3 in both groups, yielding no difference between the groups. Implant survival rate could not be meta-analysed adequately since randomised controlled trials lack the longer term follow-up in order to evaluate implant survival. A total of four revisions in the cruciate-retention and four revisions in the cruciate-sacrifice group were found. The well-validated Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) total score was not statistically significantly different between the groups (16.6 points for cruciate-retention versus 15.0 points for cruciate-sacrifice). One study reported a patient satisfaction grade (7.7 points for cruciate-retention versus 7.9 points for cruciate-sacrifice on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being completely satisfied) which did not differ statistically significantly. Complications were distributed equally between both groups. Only one study reported several re-operations other than revision surgery; that is patella luxations, surgical manipulation because of impaired flexion.</P>
<P>The mean functional Knee Society Score was 2.3 points higher (81.2 versus 79.0 points; 95% CI of the difference 0.37 to 4.26; P = 0.02) in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing group. Results from the outcome Knee Society functional score were homogeneous. All other outcome measures (extension angle, knee pain, adverse effects, clinical questionnaire scores, Knee Society clinical scores, radiological rollback, radiolucencies, femorotibial angle and tibial slope) showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. In the subgroup analyses that allowed pooling of the results of the different studies, no homogeneous statistically significant differences were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:03:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality and the quality of reporting of the studies were highly variable. With respect to range of motion, pain, clinical, and radiological outcomes, no clinically relevant differences were found between total knee arthroplasty with retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament. Two statistically significant differences were found; range of motion was 2.4 ° higher in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing group, however results were heterogeneous; and the mean functional Knee Society Score was 2.3 points higher in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing group. These differences are clinically not relevant.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:16:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:09:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease leading to degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Clinically, patients with knee osteoarthritis present in general with disabling knee pain and impaired knee function. At some point during the disease the only remaining treatment is surgery with a total knee arthroplasty.<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:15:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total knee arthroplasty is the resurfacing of the joint articulating surfaces. During total knee arthroplasty surgery several structures involved in the knee joint are either retained (for example the posterior cruciate ligament), replaced by artificial structures (for example patella resurfacing), or discarded (for example the anterior cruciate ligament and possibly the posterior cruciate ligament). The distal femur and proximal tibia are cut and replaced by a femoral and a tibial component. Between these components a polyethylene insert is placed. See <A HREF="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/11/167/figure/F1">Figure total knee arthroplasty components</A> (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For total knee arthroplasty it is desirable to reproduce the natural movements of the knee while maintaining stability from extension to flexion. In patients in whom the posterior cruciate ligament can be retained, this ligament can provide these requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Lombardi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombardi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihalko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihalko 1999</LINK>). Moreover, the posterior cruciate ligament is supposed to have different types of mechanoreceptors detecting joint position (proprioception) and joint motion (kinaesthesia) (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelissen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelissen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanik--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Swanik 2004</LINK>). However, the structural integrity of the posterior cruciate ligament of an osteoarthritic knee may be lost due to mucoid degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Nelissen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelissen 2001</LINK>). When the posterior cruciate ligament is retained in total knee arthroplasty, some studies have shown a lack of posterior femoro-tibial translation (for example the naturally occurring movement of the distal femur on the tibia, also known as rollback) with knee flexion (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 1994</LINK>). This is thought to be attributable to inadequate balancing of the posterior cruciate ligament in flexion during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Emodi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emodi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Most-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Most 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nozaki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nozaki 2002</LINK>). Balancing of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of choosing the insert thickness and component sizes in a way that the posterior cruciate ligament is adequately tensioned in flexion but relaxed in extension. When posterior cruciate ligament balancing has not been performed adequately, the patient might have a suboptimal total knee arthroplasty, which often produces pain (<LINK REF="REF-Pagnano-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagnano 1998</LINK>). If the posterior cruciate ligament is too loose, the patient might present with instability (<LINK REF="REF-Pagnano-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagnano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waslewski-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waslewski 1998</LINK>). If the posterior cruciate ligament is too tight, the patient suffers from limited flexion and the polyethylene insert is subjected to high stresses and wear (<LINK REF="REF-Migaud-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migaud 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagnano-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagnano 1998</LINK>). A release of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used in cases with a tight ligament and difficulty to perform knee flexion during the procedure.</P>
<P>In many instances, however, the posterior cruciate ligament is sacrificed in the surgical procedure and another arthroplasty design is used. Sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament results in an increase in the flexion gap (the flexion gap is the gap between the cut posterior parts of the distal femur and the cut proximal tibia when the knee is flexed) (<LINK REF="REF-Baldini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihalko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihalko 1999</LINK>). This increase is generally compensated for with thicker polyethylene inserts or larger femoral components. Sacrificing the posterior cruciate ligament leads to an increase in the extension gap as well (the extension gap is the gap between the cut distal femur and the cut proximal tibia when the knee is in extension) (<LINK REF="REF-Baldini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldini 2004</LINK>). The size of these gaps has to be in such a way that the ligaments in and around the knee joint are balanced in order to achieve stability after placement of the arthroplasty. Several adjustments in total knee arthroplasty design exist to compensate for the absence of the posterior cruciate ligament. The posterior stabilised design is most commonly used. This design has a cam post mechanism to substitute for the function of the posterior cruciate ligament and permits rollback of the femoral component on the tibial component during flexion. Other knee systems use deep dish inserts with a high anterior rim as a brake against posterior subluxation of the tibia.</P>
<P>Factors influencing the choice of sacrifice or retention of the posterior cruciate ligament are the degenerative status of the ligament, knee deformities, the type of implant used, or the personal preference of the surgeon. <LINK REF="REF-Lombardi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombardi 2001</LINK> proposed a decision tree based upon the patient's history, the clinical examination, and the intraoperative findings (<LINK REF="REF-Lombardi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombardi 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:16:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised studies comparing posterior cruciate ligament retention with sacrifice have been conducted from the early 90s up to now (<LINK REF="STD-Seon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Seon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shoji 1994</LINK>). In 2005, when the original Cochrane systematic review on this topic was published, these studies combined in a meta-analysis could not find a clear difference between the two treatments. It was impossible to give clear advice on whether to retain or to sacrifice the posterior cruciate ligament (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2005</LINK>). In this extensive update the question remains whether the study results allow for pooling and whether the pooled results favour retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament.</P>

<P>One review author (WV) conducted the literature search and retrieved the references to be evaluated. Two review authors (WV, LB) independently selected the trials to be included in the review. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. When no consensus could be reached, a third review author (WJ) was available for the decisive vote. A pre-developed and tested data extraction form was used to extract data from the selected studies. Items collected were: study design features, population data, statistical analysis techniques, intervention characteristics, and all reported outcome parameters including results. All data was entered into Review Manager 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>). When a selected article was written in a foreign language, the data extraction form was sent to a translator via the Cochrane Musculoskeletal group. A second form was used to assess the risk of bias (see below) and the clinical relevance of the selected studies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-09 12:19:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selected studies were closely examined by two review authors working independently (WV, LB). Risk of bias was assessed according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration in risk of bias tables (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). To detect selection bias, performance bias and attrition bias, several items were evaluated in all selected studies. The risk of selection bias was judged by assessing how the randomisation sequence was generated and by assessing the way the allocation of treatment was concealed. Risk of performance and detection bias was judged by evaluating the blinding (of personnel, patients and outcome assessors) in the studies. The risk of attrition bias was assessed by judging the completeness of the data, including the follow-up rates. Finally, the risk of reporting bias was assessed by judging if all (relevant) outcome measurements were reported. The possible judgments that could be made were low risk of bias, high risk of bias and unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>Besides the general comparison of total knee arthroplasties with and without sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament, several subgroup analyses were performed. First, as in the original Cochrane review, studies evaluating the effect of posterior cruciate ligament retention and sacrifice using the same design total knee arthroplasty (the posterior cruciate ligament retaining design) were considered in a subgroup analysis. Secondly, the studies evaluating the effect of posterior cruciate ligament retention and sacrifice comparing a posterior cruciate ligament retaining arthroplasty design with a posterior stabilised posterior ligament sacrificing design were considered in a subgroup analysis. When other design modifications than posterior stabilisation were studied, these were considered in separate subgroup analyses.<BR/>

<P>When it was unclear if findings in the meta-analysis were robust to the decisions made in the process of obtaining them, this was tested in a sensitivity analysis. For example, when data for a specific outcome measure were not adequately reported the analysis was performed with and without inputed outcome values. Findings were considered 'robust' when they did not change significantly. Moreover, outcomes of the meta-analyses were compared with the pooled outcomes from the studies with the lowest risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence and summary of findings tables</HEADING>
<P>For the outcome measures range of motion, flexion angle and knee pain, the primary outcome measures, beneficial effects were evaluated. To evaluate harmful effect differences between the two treatment groups we evaluated the occurrence of complications. Results were presented in 'summary of findings' tables. As prescribed by The Cochrane Collaboration, a quality of evidence assessment was performed using the GRADE approach (with GRADEpro software (version 3.6)).</P>
<P>The different grades of evidence according to the GRADE working group are as follows.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 13:28:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By thoroughly updating the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2005</LINK>) we were able to add 10 studies, described in 11 articles, to the analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Aglietti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aglietti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Andrade 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harato-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harato 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Seon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Victor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yagishita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yagishita 2012</LINK>). Only two outcomes differed statistically when all selected studies reporting similar outcomes were pooled. The range of motion was 2.4 ° higher and the functional Knee Society score was 2.3 points higher in the group with sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament. Complications were reported in 11 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aglietti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aglietti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Catani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harato-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harato 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yagishita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yagishita 2012</LINK>). Complications varied from anterior knee pain and femoral notching to deep infection. Most complications occurred equally frequently in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing and retaining groups (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). A remarkable finding in <LINK REF="STD-Harato-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harato 2008</LINK> was that the posterior cruciate ligament retaining group showed seven cases (6.3%) of a stiff knee, defined as &lt; 90 ° of flexion, compared to one case (0.9%) in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing group.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses showed statistically significant differences in range of motion and in the Knee Society functional score. Although the evidence originates from a meta-analysis of more than one randomised controlled trial, one should be aware that the effect is still unstable and sensitive to the inclusion of new studies. Moreover, the mean difference in range of motion of 2.4 ° and in mean Knee Society functional score of 2.3 points are considered clinically not relevant (<LINK REF="REF-Pijls-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijls 2011</LINK>). The table 'Assessment of clinical relevance' (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) shows that most reported outcomes are not clinically relevant. The original review also showed a statistically significant mean difference in the Hospital for Special Surgery score of 1.6 points (P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2005</LINK>) in favour of posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice arthroplasty. This difference, small and clinically not relevant, has disappeared in this review.</P>
<P>In order to have an impression of the difference in pain experienced between both groups we extracted data on pain from all studies. Four studies reported data on pain (<LINK REF="STD-Harato-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harato 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yagishita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yagishita 2012</LINK>). All four presented the pain score as derived from the Knee Society Knee score. No study showed different scores per answer of the Knee score so it is not entirely clear how these pain scores were derived. Two studies used the VAS to evaluate the pain experienced by patients yielding no differences between retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament (<LINK REF="STD-Aglietti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aglietti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yagishita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yagishita 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence, graded with the GRADE approach, ranged from moderate to low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). No harmful outcomes were presented in the summary of findings tables in this review due to the absence of reporting of sufficient data.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 13:31:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of our broad and thorough search we were able to find 10 additional studies to the previous review, increasing completeness of the evidence. Overall, outcome measures studied in the selected studies give solid indications on the clinical, functional and radiological features one might be interested in after total knee arthoplasty. Unfortunately, patient-oriented outcomes such as patient satisfaction were hardly ever studied. An exception is <LINK REF="STD-Misra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2003</LINK>, who asked patients to grade their satisfaction on a scale from one to 10.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that randomised controlled trials are described as providing the least biased evidence, the mean survival rate of total knee arthroplasty cannot be easily investigated by randomised controlled trials. Long term follow-up evaluations in observational cohort studies are valuable alternatives. A survivorship analysis report on a large cohort of 11,606 total knee arthroplasties showed a mean survival rate at 10 years after surgery of 91% (95% CI 90 to 92) in the posterior cruciate ligament retention group and 76% (95% CI 62 to 86) in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing posterior stabilised group (<LINK REF="REF-Rand-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2003)</LINK>. Abdel et al found similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Abdel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdel 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the more recent years, the high demands in performance of total knee arthroplasty in certain ethnic (for example squatting position) and religious (for example prayer position) groups as well as in younger patients who require greater magnitudes of knee flexion has led to the development of newer implants. Together with the continuing process of optimising stability and kinematics in total knee arthroplasty, high flex posterior stabilised and bi-cruciate stabilising designs were introduced. Long term follow-up studies have yet to prove whether those implants indeed show improved results compared to the more established design types. In this review, <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Seon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Seon 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yagishita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yagishita 2012</LINK> studied high flexion total knee arthroplasties.</P>

Catani (<LINK REF="STD-Catani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Catani 2004</LINK>), Misra (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2003</LINK>) and Tanzer (<LINK REF="STD-Tanzer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tanzer 2002</LINK>) were regarded as high quality studies. However, The Cochrane Collaboration nowadays discourages the use of scales assessing the quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). To assess quality and risk of bias, risk of bias tables were used as advocated by The Cochrane Collaboration. Several items were evaluated, first the method of generation of randomisation sequence. This should be based on chance and should be reported clearly to avoid doubt about bias. Together with the method of concealment of treatment allocation these items indicate the risk of selection bias. Treatment allocation has to be completely at random; knowledge of the next allocation by the care provider could result in an 'awkward' patient either being at risk of being illegally excluded from the trial or of being assigned to the other treatment group. This will lead to an overestimation of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). A valid randomisation technique is applied just before the treatments are given, thus ensuring unpredictable allocation. There are several techniques to keep the allocation unpredictable, such as sealed envelopes or a telephone call to a research centre for the treatment allocations. It was chosen to include quasi-randomised trials in the review as well. Quasi-randomisation is randomisation based on odd or even chart numbers, dates of birth, alternating sequences, day of hospital admission etc. The risk of selection bias in this kind of randomisation is higher compared to pure randomisation. Another item is blinding. In most surgical trials blinding of the surgeon is impossible. However, the patients and the observers measuring the endpoints can be blinded for the studied intervention. Well-blinded studies reduce risk of performance and detection bias. Furthermore, incomplete outcome data raise the possibility that the outcome is biased. When almost all anticipated outcome data are available the risk of attrition bias is low. Additionally, selection-by-indication bias was taken into account. This can only be corrected for if the degree of preoperative flexion contracture, valgus or varus deformity, is mentioned in the articles. Unfortunately the selected studies did not report these factors, except for one study that stated that a valgus or varus deformity in excess of 15 ° was an exclusion criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration encourages the use of the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>). This GRADE approach defines "the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the quantity of specific interest" (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials are considered as yielding high quality evidence. However, this grade can be downgraded to moderate, low or very low quality due to limitations in the design suggesting the likelihood of bias, indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency in the results, imprecision of the results, and a high probability of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Results were presented in the summary of findings tables. The Cochrane Collaboration encourages review authors to present the most important outcomes in these tables, including both beneficial and harmful outcomes. In this review serious adverse effects (for example serious complications) would be a harmful outcome, however the amount of data from the selected studies were not sufficient.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence, graded with the GRADE approach, was low for range of motion, and moderate for the outcomes flexion angle and knee pain. In the subgroup analysis of posterior cruciate ligament retention and sacrifice with the same (cruciate-retaining) arthroplasty design the evidence was graded &#8216;very low&#8217; for the outcome range of motion. In the other subgroup analyses (cruciate-retaining versus posterior stabilised) the evidence was moderate for the outcome range of motion (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of bias estimations are displayed for all selected studies in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' risk of bias tables. The studies regarded as having the least risk of bias from the current selection of articles are Chaudhary (<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2008</LINK>), Kim (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>), and Misra (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2003</LINK>). Except for <LINK REF="STD-Misra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2003</LINK> these are newly added studies. There seems to be a positive trend towards better methodologically performed and reported studies in the more recent years. However, because of the incomplete description of the methodology of the trials it was difficult to assess whether the methodology was inaccurate or the description of the methodology was just lacking information. None of the selected studies could be judged on all four items described above. Selection bias items were not described in 53% of the articles (9/17), performance bias in 41% (7/17), and attrition bias in 24% (4/17) of the studies. The summary of findings tables show the results of the quality appraisal by the GRADE approach. All outcomes were downgraded from high quality to moderate or even low quality.</P>
<P>Reporting of external funding could influence the likelihood of publication of the study. From the selected studies only one industry funded study was found (<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2008</LINK>). One study reported a non-commercial grant from the National Council of Science (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>). Eight studies did not describe external funding (<LINK REF="STD-Aglietti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aglietti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Andrade 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harato-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harato 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shoji 1994</LINK>).

<P>This review has several strengths and limitations. As mentioned before, randomised controlled trials are not the best studies to evaluate implant survival (for example 10 or 15 year survival) because follow-up is usually too short in trials. Since implant survival is an important outcome after total knee arthroplasty this is a limitation. Furthermore, we could not present information on patient experience and satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty because these data were not presented in the selected studies. Even in a systematic review, publication bias can never be ruled out with certainty. We applied a relatively broad search strategy in multiple databases. Nevertheless, some references could not be indexed in the databases; therefore we also used citation tracking and we checked the reference lists of the included articles. Screening the international trials registers via the portal of the World Health Organization (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/trialsearch">www.who.int/trialsearch</A>), four trials, tagged with an ongoing status, were found (<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12609000960257" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12609000960257</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN05635855" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN05635855</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN82612978" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN82612978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Boom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van den Boom 2009</LINK>). For one of these studies, the study protocol was published ahead of starting the trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Boom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van den Boom 2009</LINK>). No clinically relevant differences and only two statistically significant differences were found comparing the two groups in our meta-analyses, this might be due to a power problem. In the next update of the review these four studies can possibly overcome this problem.</P>
<P>This systematic review with meta-analysis was composed in accordance with the criteria of the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) (<LINK REF="REF-Liberati-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liberati 2009</LINK>). This is a revision and expansion of the QUORUM statement (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses). Another strength is that we applied a broad and extensive search strategy.</P>

<P>Similar to the randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials selected in this review, other orthopaedic literature on this topic shows inconclusive results. Range of motion, for example, is the parameter most often measured. Only two randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Catani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Catani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Straw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 2003</LINK>) found a statistically significant difference, favouring posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Stiehl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehl 1997</LINK>) found a superior range of motion for a posterior cruciate ligament retaining total knee arthroplasty and another study (<LINK REF="REF-Maloney-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maloney 1992</LINK>) for a posterior stabilised design. However, both studies showed a higher preoperative range of motion for the group with the superior results. Hirsch (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1994</LINK>) found a superior range of motion for a posterior stabilised design over posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice in a total knee arthroplasty without posterior stabilisation. Preoperative range of motion is believed to have a large influence on the postoperative results. Therefore, improvement of range of motion should be calculated and reported as well. The method of assessment of range of motion was not described in all reports. The measurement of range of motion is notoriously inaccurate if performed clinically (<LINK REF="REF-Kafer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kafer 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical rating scales are considered not very sensitive tools to evaluate the difference between two implant designs when only total scores are reported. WOMAC and KOOS scales are better validated and hence are preferred instruments for use in clinical trials. The studies in this review did not find any difference. Other non-randomised studies show the same results; several studies found no difference on the Hospital for Special Surgery score between a posterior cruciate ligament retaining and a posterior stabilised design (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinciguerra-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinciguerra 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Technically relevant outcome measures are the outcomes anterior-posterior stability and contact position. These measurements were not addressed in any of the studies. One laboratory study concludes that proper balancing is imperative to achieve proper rollback (<LINK REF="REF-Most-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Most 2003</LINK>). De Jong et al found an average contact point between the femur and tibia at the posterior two-thirds of the anteroposterior distance of the tibia and assumed that this is also the correct contact point for a replaced cruciate retaining knee implant and a correctly balanced posterior cruciate ligament (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2010</LINK>). Balancing of the posterior cruciate ligament is technically more difficult due to the oblique orientation of the posterior cruciate ligament in flexion and a strong 3 to 5 mm anterior translation of the tibia with a 2 mm increase of the insert thickness (<LINK REF="REF-Christen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heesterbeek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heesterbeek 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies using fluoroscopy suggest that participants having a posterior stabilised total knee arthroplasty have less abnormal knee kinematics in deeper flexion and greater flexion than participants having a posterior cruciate ligament retaining total knee arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Udomkiat-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udomkiat 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Victor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolterbeek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolterbeek 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolterbeek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolterbeek 2011</LINK>). As mentioned before, the posterior cruciate ligament is reported to have proprioceptive properties (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelissen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelissen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanik--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Swanik 2004</LINK>). Another study found no difference in proprioception between a posterior cruciate ligament retaining and a posterior stabilised design (<LINK REF="REF-Cash-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cash 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1996</LINK> found no difference in proprioception in moderate grades of osteoarthritis, but in higher osteoarthritis grades the posterior cruciate ligament retaining group performed better than the sacrificing group.</P>
<P>Gait analysis could provide additional but generally unvalidated results. In this review we did not find any randomised controlled trials evaluating gait analysis. Dennis et al found in two (fluoroscopic) studies that posterior cruciate ligament retaining and posterior stabilised arthroplasties have similar kinematic patterns in early flexion activities such as gait (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2004</LINK>). Bolanos et al performed gait analysis on posterior cruciate ligament retaining and posterior stabilised arthroplasties and found no statistically significant differences in range of motion or knee flexion moments during a level gait (<LINK REF="REF-Bolanos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolanos 1998</LINK>). A recent study showed no differences in gait analysis parameters between posterior cruciate ligament retention and posterior stabilised total knee arthroplasty with the ligament resected in both treatment arms (<LINK REF="REF-Joglekar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joglekar 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ishii-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishii 1998</LINK> found increased abduction and adduction and increased proximal and distal translation during gait analysis for the posterior stabilised design, which may indicate decreased stability; however the results did not differ significantly.</P>
<P>There are other issues to be considered in total knee replacement surgery like the choice of what kind of bearing system is to be used. <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2004_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2004(2)</LINK> performed a Cochrane systematic review to answer this question, this review is currently in update phase. Another question is whether or not to use cement on the implants, and <LINK REF="REF-Nakama-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakama 2012</LINK> has performed a Cochrane systematic review to answer this question. We refer to these reviews for more in-depth information on these issues.</P>

<P>Based on this update of a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis, no clear and relevant differences were identified between either retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament, or between retention and sacrifice accompanied by a posterior stabilised design. The studies found to support any conclusions on this comparison are still of limited quality. The technique of posterior cruciate ligament balancing is very demanding and complicated, and was not carefully described in the identified trials. Furthermore, the preoperative deformity of the knee might necessitate certain soft tissue releases for correct alignment, thus making it impossible to retain the posterior cruciate ligament (that is severe flexion contracture, valgus contracture). Techniques to improve balancing of the posterior cruciate ligament during total knee arthroplasty are still ongoing as this is a specific focus within total knee arthroplasty surgery. When these techniques are developed and described in sufficient detail renewed scientific experiments in patient series should be undertaken.<BR/>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-09 13:48:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Total knee arthroplasty is a successful procedure. To improve an already successful procedure we need to look at small details. We believe that the treatment of the posterior cruciate ligament during surgery remains one of those details. Therefore, choices regarding retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament should be thoroughly investigated in adequately and well-developed trials. The inability to apply surgeon blinding in these trials increases the need for independent and blinded outcome assessments. Also, after the surgical procedure, the patient cannot be changed to the other group and any revision implies that the treatment has been discontinued, so the quality criteria 'intention to treat' and 'compliance' should be used for cost effectiveness analysis but cannot be used for an analysis of the performance of the study. This should be taken into account. The quality of reporting of the trials is still poor; 33% to 66% of the risk of bias items were marked as 'unclear risk'. Sufficient information about the patient population was lacking in the majority of the studies. The degree of preoperative deformity was not mentioned. The selection criteria used should be given as well as the result of this selection procedure. This is essential for other clinicians to decide if the results of the trial are applicable to their own patient populations. In the field of knee surgery, the use of well-validated clinical rating scales such as the KOOS or WOMAC scale is important and they should be used more frequently, in the correct form.</P>
<P>Equally important is the description of the treatments applied. In the field of knee arthroplasty a few specific characteristics should be mentioned. These are the mobility of the insert (for example fixed, mobile), the status of the posterior cruciate ligament, whether either the tibial or femoral component has been cemented, the coating of the implant, the posterior tibial slope, and whether the patella has been resurfaced. The choice of the outcome parameter in a randomised trial is often of specific interest for a specific study. In studies evaluating the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee arthroplasty this should be range of motion (flexion), stability, and contact position. When more generally accepted outcome parameters are also used, the trials can be grouped together in future systematic reviews. Trials should be set up to assess the outcome parameters at uniform time intervals for all patients, before and at more than one time after the surgery. This increases the chance that identical follow-up times can be constructed from different trials. At the least, the short term outcome should be assessed at one and two years and the long term outcome at five and 10 years. It is equally important that the assessed variables are presented for the follow-up times as well for all subgroups. Besides these more technical outcome measures of total knee arthroplasty, more attention should be given to outcomes such as patient experience, quality of life and satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty.</P>
