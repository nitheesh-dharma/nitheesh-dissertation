<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-25 09:39:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastric cancer, one of the malignant tumours in the gastrointestinal tract and with high morbidity among cancers, can easily lead to death once it progresses to an advanced or late stage. There are few interventions which can postpone or stop the malignant course of the illness. However, some kinds of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) have been used as an alternative therapeutic measure to treat many gastric cancer patients in China, and might be effective as an auxiliary therapy for this illness in its advanced or late stages. Our primary investigation showed there was no assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving the quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxic and side effects caused by the chemotherapy, or reducing short-term mortality. Limited, weak evidence showed that four injections of the TCMHs Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of leukopenia, and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen for adverse events in the digestive system, but no significant differences in the rate of short-term remission. Most of the included studies were of low quality and valid comparisons were scarce, meaning that more trials are needed for meta-analysis to draw definite conclusions about their benefits.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-25 09:39:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>In general, therapeutic prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) for gastric cancer consist of a group of herbs (commonly seven to 15 kinds of herbs). Some, such as Rhizoma Curcumae, Herba Hedyotis Diffusae, Rhizoma Paridis, Astragali radix, Radix Clematidis, and Fructus Bruceae, are commonly used as direct anti-tumour agents and others, such as Tangerine peel, Milk vetch root, Pilose asiabell root, Spatholobus stem, Chinese angelica root, Flos Carthami, and Red sage root, can be added to the main prescription as supporting treatments to decrease the side effects or toxicity of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ning-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ning 1985</LINK>) or to improve the curative effect. This is described as 'strengthening the body resistance, restoring normal functioning of the body to consolidate the constitution, relieving the depressed liver and soothing the stomach, invigorating qi and enriching the blood, removing the poisonous quality of any substance and resolving the stasis'. These are the terms used in traditional Chinese medical theory (<LINK REF="REF-Gu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gu 1995</LINK>). Unfortunately, there still seems to be no special herbs or recipes that have been found to have special effects on certain kinds of cancers, so these same TCMHs can be used for other malignant tumours such as oesophageal carcinoma, hepatocarcinoma, or pulmonary carcinoma. At present, TCMHs are not recommended to treat benign tumours, such as polyps, because such diseases can be cured effectively by surgery.</P>
<P>Medicines in complex prescriptions can be given by oral administration or intravenous drip, and there are many case reports showing that patients have been treated effectively with TCMHs administered either orally or intravenously, or by both methods (<LINK REF="REF-Duan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duan 2002</LINK>). The combination administration is based on the special diagnostic modes of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpation, which mainly depend on the experience of doctors and are very different from western diagnostic methods. Although many trials appear to demonstrate that TCMHs might have some effectiveness on cancer, there is no evidence showing that TCMHs could replace surgery or radio-chemotherapy for cancer in its early stages. At present, TCMHs are mainly used as an auxiliary therapy and a palliative treatment with routine therapeutic methods for advanced or late cancer, including gastric cancer.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-24 21:29:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Although many cancers can be cured in the early stages, once they progress to advanced or late stage (that is once widespread metastasis is confirmed by medical techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (X-CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or histologic examination) there are few interventions which can postpone or stop the malignant illness leading to death. Although bio-therapies, such as gene therapy, immune therapy, bone-marrow transplantation, etc, have made some progress in some kinds of advanced or late cancers, the mortality rate of most common late malignancy tumours (such as carcinomas derived from the digestive tract, gastric cancer, hepatocarcinoma) is still high. Both the morbidity and mortality of gastric cancer rank second of all malignant tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2004</LINK>), varying from 30 per 10&#8309; to 80 per 10&#8309; and 15.9 per 10&#8309; to 32.4 per 10&#8309;, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2001</LINK>), in different countries and regions. According to the statistical data, China, Japan, and Chile are countries with high risk of morbidity and mortality, and the United States, Canada, and European countries are those with low risk (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-24 21:35:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>TCM is a common alternative therapy in China for late-stage cancer, and all the herbs cited in this review can be found in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Dictionary. TCM has its own theories and systems for diagnostic and therapeutic methods for malignant tumours. It is thought that gastric cancer, called ye-ge (similar to dysphagia) (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1989</LINK>), is caused mainly by overactive emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, anxiety, and fear) and eating or drinking too much, resulting in internal stasis of Yangqi and consumption of Yin fluid. Yin-Yang theories of TCM, derived from Taoism, state that there are two substances, Yin and Yang, in the human body and that they should match each other to keep the balance, otherwise the body is at risk of all kinds of diseases. According to matched control research, it is shown that highly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2000</LINK>) is similar to insufficiency of the spleen (Yang), or lack of coordination between the liver and the spleen; and poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma is similar to deficiency of both qi and blood, or stagnancy of qi and blood stasis. In TCM, qi means something similar to air. The theories of TCM believe there is a kind of air running throughout the entire human body, not only in the lungs but in every organ of the body, and some people can feel its existence through breathing exercises; though this viewpoint has not been proven by modern western science.</P>
<P>In traditional Chinese medicinal theory, therapeutic strategies aimed at late or advanced gastric cancer include three basic principles (<LINK REF="REF-Ji-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ji 1989</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>replenishing and strengthening the vital-qi;</LI>
<LI>reducing phlegm and resolving stasis;</LI>
<LI>clearing away heat and toxic material.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-24 22:37:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>According to the principle that treatment of a disease should deal with both the symptoms and causes at the same time, some categories of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) are used according to the Chinese medicinal typing of advanced or late gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 1997</LINK>) as alternative interventions. It is generally acknowledged that in its early stages gastric cancer can be cured with surgery, so alternative interventions (including TCMHs) are unnecessary. Once metastasis develops (that is in advanced or late-stage disease) and the opportunity for surgery is lost, the cancer can not be cured. Therefore alternative interventions, including TCMHs, are used either alone or as auxiliary therapies with radio-chemotherapy or bio-therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Though the basic research on TCMHs is still weak, and most of the active ingredients are not extracted and confirmed at present, It is believed that some TCM herbs (including Astragulus membranaceus, dandelion herb, cassia twig, Poria, magnolia bark, chaenomeles fruit, costus root, barbat skullcap, lyrate nightshade, Chinese actinidia root, Coix seed, globethistle, hornet nest (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 1999</LINK>), and others such as bighead atractylodes rhizome, Oldenlandia diffusa Roxb (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2001</LINK>), Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Allium sativum L As2O3) could inhibit the proliferation of gastric tumour cells (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2002</LINK>). Some basic research showed that isoverbascoside (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2001</LINK>), found in Pedicularis strata, has the effect of cleaning up multifarious oxyradicals. This could transfer the growth signal in the gastric cancer cell thus inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer. Astragulus membranaceus, a commonly used herb (<LINK REF="REF-Shen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shen 2007</LINK>) can down-regulate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-2 in the gastric cancer cells. Radix Astragali specifically inhibits the growth of gastric cancer cells in vitro, but it is mainly cytostatic and not cytotoxic and does not induce apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2003</LINK>). Another result from a pilot study suggests that a polysaccharide isolated from Echinacea purpurea herba cell cultures might be effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced leukopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Melchart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melchart 2002</LINK>); and the extract from Radix Curcumae, obtained by steam distillation, has a chemopreventive effect on gastric cancer induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, the alkaloid Matrine can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells in vitro; the apoptosis induction appears to be through up-regulating Fas/FasL expression and activating caspase-3 enzyme (<LINK REF="REF-Dai-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dai 2009</LINK>). Aidi injection, a commonly used TCM recipe in China, appears to have the effect of inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, including gastric cancer cells, but the effect is uncertain and needs to be assessed more thoroughly (<LINK REF="REF-Sa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sa 2003</LINK>). Other TCMHs can improve immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Bu-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bu 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 1996</LINK>), for example Fuzhenghuayu Recipe can improve the function of T-cells and inhibit metastasis after surgery in patients with gastric cancer. Some herbal recipes are believed to reduce the incidence of atypical hyperplasia in the gastric mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Qiu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 1993</LINK>), and many TCMHs (including Sijunzi decoction, As2O3, Radix Astragali seu Hedysari, Bulbus Alliican) lead to apoptosis of gastric cancer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2001</LINK>) by inducing expression of gene P53, P21. Huoxuehuayu recipe has the same effect, by inducing over-expression of Bcl-2 and inhibiting the expression of epidermoid growth factor receptors (EGFR).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-03-24 21:50:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>TCMHs have been used widely and for many years to treat gastric cancer. Much clinical experience has been summarised and the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) appeared in 1986 (<LINK REF="REF-Zeng-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 1986</LINK>). Most of the literature about TCMH for gastric cancer, especially the RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2006</LINK>), have concluded that the TCMHs have positive effects on quality of life, prolonging the life span, and alleviating adverse events caused by routine chemotherapy, but the effectiveness and adverse effects of TCMHs have not been assessed systematically. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of TCMHs for eradicating gastric cancerous cells and to determine whether TCMHs can improve the patient's general condition and prolong the average life span compared with routine clinical therapy for late or advanced gastric cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</P>

<P>Where appropriate, we combined the extracted data (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>) from the various trials by calculating a pooled estimate of the odds ratio using the method of Mantel-Haenszel, the relative risk and risk difference, and the 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous data. We used both fixed-effect and random-effects models. Where outcomes were measured as continuous data in a standard way across studies, we calculated the weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval using a random-effects model.

<P>The intervention (TCMHs) consisted of patented herbal medicine and self-produced herbal compounds.

The period of administration varied from two weeks to one year, with a median period of one to three months. The specific dosage (range 10 g to 50 g) of the herbs and the regimens, which commonly consisted of seven to 15 herbs, are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>, but some authors did not specify the dosage of herbs because of commercial or technological secrecy. In the 80 trials, there were more than 200 categories of herbs used for treating gastric cancer in the advanced or late stage. The frequency (&#8805; 20%) of the most commonly used TCMHs in the 80 trials was: Radix Astragali seu Hedysari 50.0% (40/80), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae 30.0% (24/80), Poria 30.0% (24/80), Radix Codonopsis Pilosulae 30.0% (24/80), Rhizoma Zedoariae 20.0% (16/80), Semen Coicis 20.0% (16/80).</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the 80 included studies was very poor (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Other than mentioning that the studies were randomised, none of the trials gave any information that would allow a formal assessment of quality. Most of the articles described the method of randomisation that was used, but none of the trials described double blinding or the methods used for blinding. Only five trials provided a description of withdrawals or dropouts (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1997</LINK>). None of the studies mentioned allocation concealment. In China, the results of clinical trials are given more importance than the methodology, especially if the methodology is known within the academic circle; so the methodology is not described in detail. We contacted the authors of the included studies by letter to request further data, but we received no response.</P>

<P>4.2. The authors of the three trials did not report on side effects. No trials followed up the patients, and no trials concluded that there was a statistical difference in life expectancy (MST) between the intervention group and control group. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010</LINK>) concluded that the patients in the intervention group had improved their QOL and alleviated the cancerous ache following treatment in the short term compared with patients in the control group. Other measures such as mortality and TTP were not provided and could not be analysed.</P>
<P>In the other 57 trials, the different intervention measures prevented pooling of data in a meta-analysis, and subgroup analysis on the herbs could not be performed. There were four types of clinical trials included: formulas of TCMHs with western medicine versus the same western medicine in the intervention group (type I group, 42 trials), western medicine with formulas of TCMHs versus the same formulas of TCMHs (type II group, six trials), formulas of TCMHs versus another formula of TCMHs (type III group, two trials), formulas of TCMHs versus western medicine (type IV group, seven trials).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-24 23:54:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the recipes for TCM (including TCMHs) have screened some herbs, such as Radix Astragali seu Hedysari, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Radix Codonopsis Pilosulae, Rhizoma Zedoariae, etc, the effectiveness of TCM for gastric cancer in an advanced or late stage still needs further confirmation by more trials.</P>
<P>Eighty trials with 6857 advanced or late-stage gastric cancer patients were identified. Most trials were of low quality and used TCMHs plus chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone (65 trials). Others included TCMHs plus western therapeutic methods compared with the same TCMHs (type II, seven trials), TCMHs compared with another TCMH (type III, two trials), and TCMHs compared with western therapeutic methods (type IV, six trials). Except for four trials of Huachansu, six trials of Aidi, seven trials of Fufangkushen, three trials of Shenqifuzheng, we could not pool the other 57 results because no more than two used the same intervention or outcomes.</P>
<P>TCMHs with or without chemotherapy in the 57 trials showed a statistically significant difference for the improvement of mortality in nine trials, quality of life in 16 trials, rate of remission in 11 trials, discontinuation from treatment in three trials, leukopenia in five trials, and vomiting and nausea in one trial. The pooled results from the four injections of TCMHs, Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng, showed statistically significant differences for improvement of leukopenia; and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen for adverse events in the digestive system; but no significant difference in the rate of short-term remission.</P>
<P>A standard, generally accepted formula of TCM should be used for gastric cancer in an advanced or late stage in large-scale, randomised, double blind and multi-centre trials in China.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-03-24 23:56:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Although the results, including those of the meta-analysis and description, implied that TCMHs may have some curative effects for advanced or late-stage gastric cancer, obtaining more TTP or MST and fewer toxic and side effects than the commonly used western medicine for chemotherapy mentioned above, it is still too early to draw the conclusion that the TCMHs have definitive curative effects for advanced or late-stage gastric cancer because of the methodological limitations of the data from the trials. Information on allocation concealment, side effects, adverse events, and follow-up have not been provided adequately for research. All of the primary data should be offered for further analyses, regardless of the positive or negative conclusions of the clinical trials.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-03-25 00:00:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>The RCTs should be designed strictly, for example to use the same medicine, same dosage, same course in the controlled group; and when including patients with different levels of illness (stage III or IV) the trial should use stratified randomisation. At the same time, the method of allocation concealment for clinical trials should be clarified by the authors. In the 80 included studies, only seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2010</LINK>) mentioned that they used a random number table (or drawing straws, envelope concealment), without any special explanation. An urgent mission in the TCM field for gastric cancer is to change the current reporting practices of the study authors. Even if the method of allocation concealment is clear to some, it should be elucidated completely in the article for the purpose of further analysis.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-03-25 00:01:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>The journal editors responsible for publication should ask the authors to include information about the methods of the trials and authors should not be permitted to omit these contents. Details of follow-up and adverse events should also be provided, regardless of whether they occurred or not.</P>
<P>It should be noted that although meta-analysis could not be carried out for most of the trials on Huachansu, because most of the trials were not strictly RCTs, the TCMH Huachansu has been used widely for many years in China. The main components of Huachansu include extracts from the skin of the Chinese toad.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-03-28 12:57:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>Because the classical therapeutic regimen for advanced or late-stage gastric cancer is chemotherapy, and almost all of the researchers in TCM circles are aware of this, choosing it as the active comparator in the control group makes the efficacy of TCHMs more convincing than if they had been compared with placebo. The trials were all designed as equivalence trials and no placebo controlled trials were carried out. Some researchers believe their self-made formulas of TCMHs for gastric cancer in an advanced or late stage to be more effective than some patented TCMHs, so in the type II group some commonly used patented medicines of TCMHs were chosen as the active comparators in the control group. Other relevant reviews about TCMHs for breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2007</LINK>), TCMHs for colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2008</LINK>),<B> </B>and TCMHs for lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Rui-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rui 2008</LINK>) all showed that TCMHs may alleviate the chemotherapy-related side effects or adverse events, but the evidence is too limited to make any confident conclusions. More high quality studies are needed.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-25 00:05:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-25 00:04:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>This review did not provide assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving the quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxic and side effects caused by the chemotherapy, delaying the time to progression, prolonging the median survival times, or reducing short-term mortality. Limited and weak evidence showed that Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng, when used together with chemotherapy, improved leukopenia; and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen also improved the adverse events in the digestive system caused by chemotherapy but did not improve the rate of short-term remission (complete remission or partial remission). Limitations were due to most of the included studies being of low quality and the scarcity of valid samples. Large, well designed clinical trials are required urgently before any confident conclusions can be drawn about the value of TCMHs for advanced or late-stage gastric cancer.</P>
<P>At present, the general evidence is insufficient to suggest that clinical practice should be changed on the basis of these results.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-25 00:05:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>A standardised formula of TCMHs should be developed and used for all trials of advanced or late-stage gastric cancer in China. Data from large, randomised, double blind, multi-centre trials are required to confirm the benefit and safety of TCMHs for treatment of advanced or late-stage gastric cancer. These trials should use standardised outcome measures for efficacy and should include an assessment of adverse events. All the trials should provide adequate follow-up periods so that long-term efficacy and safety can be assessed.</P>
