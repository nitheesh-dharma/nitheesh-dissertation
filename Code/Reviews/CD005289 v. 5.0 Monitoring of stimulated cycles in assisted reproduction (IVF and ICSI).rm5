<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-07 10:35:14 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Review question: can ultrasound alone be used safely without adding estradiol blood test measurements to monitor women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation during IVF and ICSI? We reviewed the evidence on monitoring women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation as part of IVF or ICSI by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) only versus traditional combined monitoring (TVUS) and blood hormone (estradiol) levels.</P>
<P>Background: assisted reproduction techniques such as IVF and ICSI involve ovarian hyperstimulation. The ovaries are artificially stimulated to produce follicles and then ovulation (release of a mature ovum or egg) is induced so that eggs can be retrieved for use in either IVF or ICSI to produce embryos in the laboratory. Traditionally women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation prior to ovulation induction have been monitored by TVUS and measurement of the hormone estradiol level in their blood. The aim of monitoring is to detect the optimum time to induce ovulation (by the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin or luteinising hormone) and to determine an adequate response to ovarian hyperstimulation to allow egg retrieval, but importantly also to identify women at risk of the potentially serious rare condition of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). It has been suggested that a simplified protocol of monitoring by TVUS alone may reduce unnecessary anxiety and operational costs during IVF and ICSI.</P>
<P>Study characteristics: we included six randomised controlled trials conducted in the UK, France, Spain, Israel and the US, including 781 women. They compared monitoring with TVUS only versus TVUS plus serum estradiol concentration in women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF and ICSI treatment. The evidence was current to May 2014.</P>
<P>Key results: none of the six studies reported our primary outcome of live birth rate. Pooled data showed no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rate between monitoring with TVUS only and monitoring with TVUS plus estradiol measurement (odds ratio (OR) 1.10; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54; four studies; N = 617; I = 5%; low quality evidence). Our findings suggest that compared with women with a 34% chance of clinical pregnancy using monitoring with TVUS plus serum estradiol, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using TVUS only was between 29% and 44%. There was no evidence of a difference in<I> </I>OHSS between the two arms (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.48 to 2.20; six studies; N = 781; I = 0%; low quality evidence), suggesting that compared with women with a 4% chance of OHSS using monitoring with TVUS plus serum estradiol, the OHSS rate in women monitored by TVUS only was between 2% and 8%.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence: the evidence was of low quality. Limitations included imprecision and potential bias due to unclear randomisation methods, allocation concealment and blinding, as well as differences in the treatment protocols. Quality assessment was hampered by a lack of methodological descriptions in several studies. Two studies reported funding by pharmaceutical companies, whereas the remaining four studies did not report their sources of funding.</P>

<P>Traditional monitoring of ovarian hyperstimulation during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment has included transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) plus serum estradiol levels to ensure safe practice by reducing the incidence and severity of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) whilst achieving the good ovarian response needed for assisted reproduction treatment.

<P>With this update, four new studies were identified resulting in a total of six trials including 781 women undergoing monitoring of COH with either TVUS alone or a combination of TVUS and serum estradiol concentration during IVF or ICSI treatment.</P>
<P>None of the six studies reported our primary outcome of live birth rate.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-05 19:05:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review update found no evidence from randomised trials to suggest that combined monitoring by TVUS and serum estradiol is more efficacious than monitoring by TVUS alone with regard to clinical pregnancy rates and the incidence of OHSS. The number of oocytes retrieved appeared similar for both monitoring protocols. The data suggest that both these monitoring methods are safe and reliable. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because the overall quality of the evidence was low. Results were compromised by imprecision and poor reporting of study methodology. A combined monitoring protocol including both TVUS and serum estradiol may need to be retained as precautionary good clinical practice and as a confirmatory test in a subset of women to identify those at high risk of OHSS. An economic evaluation of the costs involved with the two methods and the views of the women undergoing cycle monitoring would be welcome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-05 19:31:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall aim of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in assisted reproduction is to achieve pregnancy and ultimately live births. A successful outcome from IVF and ICSI is dependent upon a preliminary phase of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) using exogenous gonadotrophins. The aim of COH is to produce multiple follicles and thereafter to induce follicle maturation. Ovulation is then induced by administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or luteinizing hormone, which then allows optimal and multiple opportunities for subsequent fertilisation. However, during this process of COH and induction there exists the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which is the most serious iatrogenic complication of ovarian stimulation. There is debate over whether women should be monitored during COH using a combination of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and serum estradiol measurements or by TVUS alone.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-05 19:22:52 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of achieving clinical pregnancy and ultimately live births must be balanced with the risks associated with assisted reproductive techniques, and specifically those related to ovarian hyperstimulation. OHSS is a systemic condition associated with development of a large number of follicles and is a potentially fatal condition (<LINK REF="REF-Delvigne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delvigne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schenker-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schenker 1978</LINK>). OHSS can lead to ascites, pleural and pericardial effusion, haemoconcentration, venous thromboembolism, hepatorenal failure and coagulopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Borase-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borase 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delvigne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delvigne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schenker-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schenker 1978</LINK>). It has been suggested that the condition is related to the release of vasoactive chemicals from the ovaries during COH and ovulation induction, which leads to increased vascular permeability and thus fluid shifts extravascularly (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 2006</LINK>). However, the exact aetiology remains unknown. The incidence of OHSS is estimated to range from 0.2% to 2.7% of all assisted reproductive cycles, including intra-uterine insemination (<LINK REF="REF-Asch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asch 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferraretti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferraretti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDougall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDougall 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nygren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nygren 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roest-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roest 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smitz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smitz 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-05 19:25:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>COH is monitored by means of TVUS in order to gain information on the number and size of developing follicles and to determine the optimal time for hCG administration prior to oocyte retrieval. Some fertility units measure serum estradiol concentration alongside TVUS during the course of COH to provide added information about the ovarian response and the potential risk of hyperstimulation. Combined monitoring with TVUS and serum estradiol concentrations has been suggested to be the gold standard for monitoring stimulated cycles in IVF and ICSI procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Rizk-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizk 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-07-05 19:30:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number and size of follicles visualised at TVUS provide an estimate of ovarian response and hCG is used to trigger ovulation when a certain number of follicles reach a certain size. Estradiol, which is produced by developing follicles, provides additional information which is believed to further improve the decision making process; follicle maturity is supported by adequate estradiol levels while there is an increased risk of OHSS in the presence of very high levels. The overall aim is to ensure optimal stimulation of the ovaries and to reduce the incidence and severity of OHSS whilst obtaining a successful treatment outcome.</P>
<P>TVUS monitoring alone has been reported to provide more accurate information on follicular number and size than can be obtained by serum estradiol concentration alone in women with anovulatory infertility undergoing gonadotrophin induction therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Haning-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haning 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardiman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardiman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoham 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>A cohort study comparing TVUS only versus TVUS plus hormonal determinations, including serum estradiol concentrations, for ovarian monitoring in women undergoing IVF reported no differences in live birth rate and the incidence of OHSS, and there was a significant economic benefit in the TVUS only monitoring protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Murad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murad 1998</LINK>). Another cohort study reported that TVUS alone, performed during COH in IVF and intra-uterine insemination, predicted 88% of cycle decisions as compared to 100% of cycle decisions that were predicted using combined monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Confino-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Confino 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>One non-randomised study reported no differences in IVF outcomes and incidence of OHSS between women whose ovarian response was monitored by TVUS and serum estradiol concentration on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration and women who were monitored with TVUS only and had the serum estradiol concentration checked if the risk of OHSS was deemed to be high (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2002</LINK>). A more recent non-randomised study compared combined monitoring with ultrasound monitoring only in women undergoing IVF and ICSI and reported equivalence in results between the two arms for the primary outcome of number of mature oocytes at egg retrieval (<LINK REF="REF-Vandekerckhove-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandekerckhove 2014</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-05 19:31:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The need for combined monitoring during COH in IVF and ICSI is controversial. It has been suggested that close monitoring is time consuming, expensive and inconvenient for the woman (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rainhorn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rainhorn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1992</LINK>). Simplification of IVF therapy by minimal monitoring has been reported to have no adverse effects on treatment outcome and the incidence of OHSS (<LINK REF="REF-Abdalla-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdalla 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roest-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roest 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1994</LINK>) and some IVF programs have abandoned the use of the hormone assay completely (<LINK REF="REF-Kemeter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemeter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vlaisavljevic-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlaisavljevic 1992</LINK>). This review is important to couples, clinicians and researchers because if there is evidence that estradiol measurements are unnecessary, hospitals and clinics could change their protocols thus reducing associated costs and anxiety to the couple undergoing IVF or ICSI.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design and setting</HEADING>
<P>The six included studies were all RCTs published between 1994 and 2012 (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>) and conducted in UK (N = 1), France (N = 1), Spain (N = 1), Israel (N = 2) and the US (N = 1). One was a multi-centre study involving four assisted conception units (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>). None of the trials specifically reported that the participants included egg donors. We did not identify any cross-over trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The studies included 781 women (sample size ranged from 50 to 297), 394 in the control groups and 387 in the intervention groups, with an overall age range between 23 and 42 years. Two studies included only women admitted for the first IVF attempt (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>) and two studies included women who had had less than three previous unsuccessful IVF cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>). Women for ICSI were excluded from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>) and so were women with a previous history of serious OHSS (<LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>). Most participants were women with subfertility problems due to tubal factors, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), male factors or unexplained infertility.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In this review, ovarian monitoring in the intervention group was conducted by TVUS only; and that of the control group by TVUS plus serum estradiol concentration. All six studies reported the use of TVUS to measure follicular growth. Details of COH protocols were not available for every study, and they differed in the use of agonist or antagonist gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH). Three studies based the protocol used and dose according to individual response (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>) or as preferred or determined by the clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>). In one study, all women had hormonal assays and ultrasound examinations but the results were only made known to the clinicians after oocyte retrieval (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Primary outcomes: none of the six included studies reported the primary outcome of live birth rate. One study reported the ongoing pregnancy rate per cycle initiated (<LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-05 22:15:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were no data on live births. With respect to pregnancy outcomes, in pooling the data of these six trials involving 781 women we found no evidence that cycle monitoring by TVUS alone was any less effective or efficacious than combined monitoring by TVUS plus estradiol assay. However, this interpretation was limited by the imprecision of the findings and the overall low quality of the included studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-01 13:39:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Although the pooled results of these six studies suggest that TVUS alone may potentially be a satisfactory monitoring tool for women undergoing COH for IVF or ICSI, the overall completeness and applicability of the evidence is limited.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported our primary outcome of live births and all of the studies were of low methodological quality. One weakness was the variability of the inclusion criteria for participants. The studies included women undergoing their first IVF attempts (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>) as well as women who had already received three previous IVF attempts (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>). Women for both IVF and ICSI were included in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>) and women for ICSI were excluded in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>), as were women with previous serious OHSS (<LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>). Women undergoing ICSI (that is those with partners with male factor problems) may be younger than those receiving IVF. These different patient selection criteria may have led to bias in the results due to different responses to treatment. Excluding those with previous OHSS may lead to a spuriously lower proportion of women with this condition in a subsequent cycle. Women were enrolled for a single treatment cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>), for more than one cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>), and three studies did not report the number of cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>). The different inclusion criteria for women participating in the studies included in this review limit its generalisability.</P>
<P>Likewise, the criteria for stimulation protocols varied between the studies and it is not clear how this difference would influence the outcomes. In three studies all women were treated with a standardised protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>) and in two trials differing protocols were offered depending on clinical assessment and physician preference (<LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>). One study described a standardised protocol with all women receiving GnRH analogues initially and with 35% to 36% of the women receiving further GnRH antagonists depending on predefined criteria of estradiol level or presence of one follicle &#8805; 13 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, the timing of TVUS in cycles varied between studies though the significance of this is uncertain and likely reflects the individual local protocols.</P>
<P>There was a lack of definitions for the outcomes assessed. For the three studies which presented the definitions of clinical pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>) they differed, ranging from 'fetal sac (with or without fetal heart activity) visualised by US on day 28 to 42 after hCG' (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>) to 'as confirmed by a fetal heartbeat determined by TVUS; approximately 32 days after embryo transfer' (<LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>) and 'presence of an intra-uterine gestational sac at US' (<LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>). The definition of OHSS was not presented in any of the studies and it was uncertain if the reported cases of 'severe' OHSS in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>) were similar in nature. This lack of uniformity and consistency in outcomes definitions is an important shortcoming as there is potential for the assessed outcomes to be different, thus affecting the generalisability and applicability of the evidence.</P>
<P>Some studies either did not report or were unable to provide information to allow computation of outcomes 'per woman' when 'per cycle' data only were reported. This resulted in two studies being excluded from the analysis for the outcome on pregnancy rate (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>), further limiting the evidence base, its generalisability and applicability. Our attempts to contact the authors were unsuccessful and we received no response.</P>
<P>Cycle monitoring with both TVUS and estradiol measurement is likely to involve higher costs (to cover technicians and laboratory costs, outpatient attendance) when compared with TVUS alone. Hormonal assays involve repeated venepuncture, which may cause stress and anxiety to women. However, it is unclear if women would be more satisfied with combined monitoring and because of a placebo effect with the perception that they are being monitored more closely. In future research it would be useful to know which monitoring protocol women were more satisfied with.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-01 13:37:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Using GRADE methods, the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for all comparisons (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The main reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence were risk of bias and imprecision. The methodological quality of the included studies was poor. This was largely due to some studies failing to describe their methods in adequate detail, such as methods of randomisation and allocation concealment and patient characteristics, resulting in the small quantity of relevant usable data that was available. In addition, five of the six studies did not conduct data analyses based on the ITT principle. Our efforts to contact study authors for further information were unsuccessful.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The addition of new trials in this update enables the aggregation of outcomes data, especially for pregnancy rate per woman. The methodological quality of the trials was variable (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Population and treatment characteristics could influence the success of the IVF treatment. It is difficult to determine whether or not there was significant clinical heterogeneity as there was a lack of methodological details, particularly in the pilot study presented as a conference abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>). Overall, the included studies appeared to investigate a shared research question with the same intervention and comparator. Five of the six included studies took place in assisted reproduction units (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rongieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rongieres 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiser-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blinding was variably reported in the studies. Women may feel either anxious or reassured if they receive combined monitoring and in this context an unblinded design would be potentially beneficial to measure certain outcomes. However, women's perception of anxiety or reassurance from venepuncture for estradiol measurement is unlikely to influence live birth and pregnancy rates. Assessor blinding would reduce performance and detection bias in oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer when they are not aware of the women's allocation status. In one study, women in the intervention and control groups received combined monitoring and results of the estradiol levels were made known to the clinicians after oocyte retrieval (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>). Studies whereby women are not blinded to their monitoring regime may be of clinical interest in the future.</P>
<P>There was a possibility that some of the randomised women may not have reached oocyte recovery stage due to cycles cancelled for inappropriate COH (either an under or over response). This is important in trials where ovarian response may be affected by the monitoring regimen. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lass-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lass 2003</LINK>) nine women left the study before the hCG injection, six due to failure of human rFSH treatment, one because of risk of OHSS, one received saline instead of hCG, and one woman failed to follow the drug protocol. In this study a total of 42 women (14.1%) did not reach the embryo transfer stage, although the reasons for discontinuing treatment did not differ between the two groups.</P>
<P>For the reporting of number of oocytes retrieved per woman, it was not clear from the included studies that the means reported for oocytes correctly included zero counts for those with cancelled cycles. This would have the effect of both increasing the mean and reducing the standard deviation (SD), therefore exaggerating the statistical significance of the comparisons. Lack of this information from the studies and the authors increases the uncertainty of data reliability. In addition, the interpretation of US may potentially differ because it involves some degree of inter-observer variability, especially in units where successive scans may be performed by different personnel.</P>
<P>We contacted all authors for missing and additional information about their studies but received no response. One author responded that the data were no longer available due to the long time lapse from when the study was conducted, 20 years ago.</P>

<P>We did not exclude studies on the grounds of language and included one Spanish and one French study. One study was a conference abstract. Despite our efforts to contact authors, we were unable to obtain further information from them and some bias in the review process could have arisen due to the inclusion of trials with insufficient information on methods and outcome data and where authors did not respond to our enquiries.<BR/>

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-05 22:53:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent systematic review of six studies reported that, compared to TVUS plus hormonal measurement, monitoring COH with TVUS only was unlikely to substantially change the chance of achieving clinical pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing IVF treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Martins-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2013</LINK>). They included five studies, all of which were included in this review except for one (<LINK REF="STD-Strawn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strawn 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>One RCT that compared combined monitoring with traditional two-dimensional (2D) US versus automated three-dimensional (3D) US reported comparable outcomes for clinical pregnancy, number of oocytes retrieved and number of fertilised oocytes (<LINK REF="STD-Raine_x002d_Fenning-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Raine-Fenning 2010</LINK>). This suggests that traditional 2D US is no more or less efficient than 3D ultrasound for monitoring stimulated cycles in assisted reproduction.</P>
<P>A recent study to validate the saliva-based estradiol assay for intra- and inter-assay variability found that it was associated with improved patient satisfaction and reduced anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Zimon-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimon 2013</LINK>), and this method may provide an equivalent but 'patient-friendly' alternative to serum-based assessment. However, in the absence of any effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data from RCTs comparing the effects of serum estradiol and saliva-based estradiol assays, the non-invasive saliva-based estradiol assay would still incur anxiety and costs. Serum estradiol may be perceived as a more reliable parameter, especially in women at risk of OHSS in whom decisions on cycle cancellation or elective freezing of oocytes or embryos may need to be taken. However, as the findings of this review show that current evidence is limited, high quality RCTs to assess monitoring methods would be welcome. A cycle monitoring protocol including both US and serum estradiol concentrations may need to be retained as precautionary good clinical practice and in a subset of women as a confirmatory test to identify those at high risk of OHSS, such as women with a history of OHSS or with polycystic ovaries, those exposed to ovulation induction, and younger women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>No formal cost analysis was reported in these studies. The studies reviewed were not designed to test the cost-effectiveness of the two interventions. However, it was suggested that avoiding serum hormone determination might save over USD 150 (at early 1990 prices) in each cycle and this would compensate for the cost of the GnRHa (<LINK REF="STD-Golan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Golan 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review update found no evidence from randomised controlled trials to suggest that combined monitoring by TVUS and serum estradiol is more efficacious than monitoring by TVUS alone, with regard to clinical pregnancy rates and the incidence of OHSS. The number of oocytes retrieved appeared similar for both monitoring protocols. The data suggest that both of these monitoring methods are safe and reliable. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because the overall quality of the evidence was low. Results were compromised by imprecision and poor reporting of study methodology. A combined monitoring protocol including both TVUS and serum estradiol may need to be retained as precautionary good clinical practice and as a confirmatory test in a subset of women to identify those at high risk of OHSS.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-05 22:55:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To find a difference in an important but rare outcome such as OHSS, a large randomised controlled study requiring the recruitment of approximately 5000 women is needed for each randomised arm, and this would pose a great methodological challenge. Based on the quoted risk of OHSS following IVF in Europe of 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Ferraretti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferraretti 2012</LINK>) and a hypothetical trial of an intervention for reduction of OHSS with a clinically meaningful effect size, meaning to halve this risk (from 1% to 0.5%) with 90% power and 95% confidence (alpha = 0.05), the trial would need 4675 women in each randomised arm. However, an economic evaluation of the costs involved in these two monitoring methods and assessing the views of the women undergoing cycle monitoring would be welcome.</P>
