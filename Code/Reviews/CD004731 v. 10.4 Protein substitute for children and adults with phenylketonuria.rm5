<TITLE>The impact of protein substitute on the nutrition status, growth, and neuropsychological performance of children and adults with phenylketonuria</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 14:08:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with phenylketonuria (PKU) who follow a low-phenylalanine diet are required to take protein substitute to ensure adequate consumption of protein, energy, and other nutrients. The need for protein substitute has been established through clinical experience and observational data. Randomised, controlled trials are needed to confirm this need as well as its proper dosage and frequency of use. We performed a systematic review of randomised control trials investigating the impact of the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute on physical and neuropsychological outcomes in the treatment of PKU. Trials of children and adults diagnosed with PKU in the newborn period who were treated early and continuously were included. We planned to pool the results of the trials to estimate treatment effect. Three trials met the inclusion criteria for the review. One trial evaluated the impact of protein substitute versus no protein substitute on neuropsychological status, plasma amino acid concentrations, and nutrient intake. The remaining two trials investigated the impact of differing dosages of protein substitute on plasma amino acid concentrations and nutrient intake. No trials investigating daily protein substitute distribution were eligible for inclusion in the review. Results are presented in text form only since adequate information for data pooling was not provided. The investigators will be contacted for further information. Currently data are insufficient to reach any conclusions regarding the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute in the treatment of PKU. Further randomized or controlled clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for the effectiveness, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute in the treatment of PKU.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-08 16:04:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Phenylketonuria is an inherited metabolic disorder characterised by an absence or deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. The aim of treatment is to lower blood phenylalanine concentrations to the recommended therapeutic range to prevent developmental delay and support normal growth. Current treatment consists of a low-phenylalanine diet in combination with a protein substitute which is free from or low in phenylalanine. Guidance regarding the use, dosage, and distribution of dosage of the protein substitute over a 24-hour period is unclear, and there is variation in recommendations among treatment centres. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2008.</P>

<P>Three trials (69 participants) are included in this review. One trial investigated the use of protein substitute in 16 participants, while a further two trials investigated the dosage of protein substitute in a total of 53 participants.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-18 11:47:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>No conclusions could be drawn about the short- or long-term use of protein substitute in phenylketonuria due to the lack of adequate or analysable trial data. Additional data and randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the use of protein substitute in phenylketonuria. Until further evidence is available, current practice in the use of protein substitute should continue to be monitored with care.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Phenylketonuria</HEADING>
<P>Phenylketonuria (PKU) (PKU; OMIM 261600) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that, if untreated, can lead to severe mental retardation, eczema, seizures, and behavioural disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Paine-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paine 1957</LINK>). PKU is most often caused by a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.1) (PAH) gene, resulting in little to no liver PAH activity. Consequently, phenylalanine metabolism is impaired, plasma concentrations of phenylalanine rise above 120 µmol/L (2 mg/dL), and the brain and other tissues have increased concentrations of phenylalanine (<LINK REF="REF-Scriver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scriver 2001</LINK>). Treatment of PKU necessitates the initiation of dietary phenylalanine restriction and tyrosine supplementation within the first few weeks of life to prevent disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Bickel-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bickel 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pietz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietz 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite successful treatment, lack of diet adherence has been linked to elevated plasma phenylalanine levels and adverse sequelae throughout the lifespan of people with PKU, particularly children and females of childbearing age (<LINK REF="REF-Pennington-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fehrenbach-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehrenbach 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Legido-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legido 1993</LINK>). Relaxation of the diet leads to poor performance in school, decreased attention span, and lower intellectual function (IQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Krause-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krause 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1995</LINK>). Effects on the unborn foetus of a pregnant mother with uncontrolled PKU are reminiscent of foetal alcohol syndrome: small head size, mental retardation, heart disease, growth retardation, and facial dysmorphia (<LINK REF="REF-Lipson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rouse-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouse 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phenylketonuria affects people throughout the world with varying incidence and severity, and many countries routinely screen newborns for PKU (<LINK REF="REF-Waisbren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waisbren 2007</LINK>). Given the more than 531 mutations already identified in the PAH gene (<LINK REF="REF-PAH-database-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">PAH database 2007</LINK>), there is a wide variation in disease severity, with residual PAH activity ranging from less than 2% up to 70% of full activity (<LINK REF="REF-Guldberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guldberg 1998</LINK>). Individuals with classical PKU exhibit very low or no PAH activity, and plasma phenylalanine concentrations exceed 1000 µmol/L when untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Scriver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scriver 2001</LINK>), whereas those with milder forms of PKU, termed hyperphenylalanaemia, have partial PAH activity, and plasma phenylalanine concentrations do not exceed 1000 µmol/L when untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Scriver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scriver 2001</LINK>). In the present review the term PKU encompasses both classical PKU and hyperphenylalaninaemia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dietary Management of PKU</HEADING>
<P>The ultimate goal of diet management is to achieve plasma phenylalanine within recommended concentrations while maintaining adequate nutrition for normal growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>). First used to manage PKU in 1951 (<LINK REF="REF-Bickel-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bickel 1953</LINK>), the cornerstone of the treatment is restriction of dietary phenylalanine, plus a protein substitute to supply missing essential amino acids and sometimes other nutrients.</P>
<P>The average dietary intake of phenylalanine in the US among all ages and both sexes is 3.4 g/day (3400 mg/day) (<LINK REF="REF-DRIs-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRIs 2002</LINK>). For people with PKU, the amount of phenylalanine in the diet must be restricted, depending upon the level of PAH activity, to maintain recommended plasma phenylalanine concentrations. Those with classical PKU must reduce dietary phenylalanine to 0.2 to 0.5 g/day (200 to 500 mg/day) whereas those with hyperphenylalanaemia can tolerate more than 0.5 g/day (500 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Scriver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scriver 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over-restriction of phenylalanine can lead to poor growth, mild to moderate osteoporosis, and other effects of malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Hanley-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibinga-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibinga 1971</LINK>). Thus, small portions of foods containing low or moderate amounts of protein, including fruits, vegetables, grains, potatoes, and specialized low-protein foods, are recommended to provide the amount of phenylalanine tolerated by each individual. With the exception of many fruits and vegetables, one gram of protein in food contains approximately 50 mg of phenylalanine (<LINK REF="REF-Weetch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weetch 2006</LINK>). A diet restriction limiting phenylalanine to 250 mg, therefore, would allow for a total of 5 g of natural (intact) protein per day. To comply with this restriction, foods high in protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, milk, nuts, and eggs, are generally eliminated from the diet and a synthetic protein substitute (called a medical food or amino acid mixture) lacking phenylalanine supplies much of the essential amino acid needs.</P>
<P>Protein substitute typically provides 52% to 80% of total dietary protein (<LINK REF="REF-Gropper-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gropper 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>) and the majority of essential and conditionally essential amino acids. In many cases these products also contain carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and minerals. New varieties of protein substitutes are emerging to improve adherence, touted as having better taste, convenience, energy and nutrient contents, variety of choices, and packaging. Restriction of dietary phenylalanine without an adequate supply of protein substitute has been associated with inadequate intakes of multiple nutrients, including vitamin B12, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, folate, magnesium, and protein ((<LINK REF="REF-Gropper-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gropper 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), which can lead to deficiencies (<LINK REF="REF-Hanley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aung-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aung 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2000</LINK>) and poor growth (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whether the protein needs are greater for people with PKU continues to be an area of debate. Observational studies of children with PKU aged two months to fifteen years have shown adequate and consistent growth in height over time when consuming protein, a large proportion of which comes from protein substitutes, at levels at or above general population recommendations. Adequate growth is defined as attaining a height-for-age percentile within the normal range, and consistent growth is defined as following a consistent height-for-age growth curve over time (<LINK REF="REF-Kindt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Acosta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acosta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dobbelaere-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobbelaere 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huemer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huemer 2007</LINK>). If protein needs are increased in this population, it is likely due to the bioavailability, biological value, and net protein utilization of the protein source (i.e., protein substitute) (<LINK REF="REF-Kindt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Przyrembel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Przyrembel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoeksma-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoeksma 2005</LINK>). People with PKU consuming free amino acids have shown increased urinary nitrogen (N) loss, and healthy adults have shown increased oxidation and decreased overall protein synthesis compared with comparison groups consuming the same amount of N from intact protein (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Metges-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metges 2000</LINK>). However, a recent study of adults with PKU taking free amino acid-based protein substitute and adults without PKU taking protein from intact sources, both at 0.8 g protein equivalent/kg body weight/day infused intravenously (Note: the gram weight of free amino acids was multiplied by a factor of 0.8 to calculate protein equivalency), showed no differences in protein turnover, oxidation, and net protein balance (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijn 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is considerable agreement that consumption of protein substitute should be evenly spread throughout the day to optimise protein utilization for anabolism and to control plasma phenylalanine concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 1999</LINK>). In one study, people with PKU typically consuming one to two doses of protein substitute shifted to three equal doses of protein substitute for one day; this shift resulted in a decrease in total urinary N excretion of 4% to 28%, controlling for N intake in eight of ten free-living participants. In turn, N balance increased or stayed constant for nine of ten participants (<LINK REF="REF-Schoeffer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoeffer 1994</LINK>). Adding support to this finding, Herrmann and colleagues also found decreased total urinary N excretion, controlling for N intake, when a patient consumed a third of her daily protein substitute at a time compared with the entire daily protein substitute at once. Maximum <SUP>13</SUP>C-exhalation, indicating amino acid oxidation, was also lower in the five hours after taking only a third of the daily protein for breakfast (<LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Importance</HEADING>
<P>Since treatment guidelines vary both between and within different countries (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>), justification for the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute is essential for optimal, cost-effective treatment of PKU. In this review, we will investigate data obtained from relevant randomised, controlled clinical trials in an attempt to resolve discrepancies in treatment guidelines. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yi 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>A post hoc change was made to the interventions previously outlined in this review. Initially the intervention was to compare a high dose of protein substitute (greater than or equal to 3 g of amino acids per kg per day based on the highest dose recommended by Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines) with a lower dose (less than 3 g of amino acids per kg per day). This was changed as it was recognised that this practice has changed and continues to change since the publication of the MRC guidelines, and lower protein substitute doses than those quoted in the MRC report are being used (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-01-09 14:07:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each trial included in this review contained small numbers of participants. In a future update of the review, it may be possible to include more data from these trials if provided by the authors.</P>
<P>Although the Schindler trial conducted an intent-to-treat analysis on the primary outcome measures, two participants were excluded from the analysis of nutrient intakes due to missing data. The exclusion of these data may increase the risk for bias in these results, however the impact on the overall trial findings is likely to be low.</P>
<P>Although little evidence has been found to support the use, the dosage, and the distribution of doses of protein substitute, this does not mean that these products are ineffective. Rather, the data available are insufficient to reach any conclusions regarding its use. Clinical experience and observational data have revealed that without protein substitute many people with PKU would not take sufficient protein to facilitate normal growth or body maintenance and control of blood phenylalanine. It is important to ascertain the quantity and quality of protein substitute required, as well as the frequency of administration to ensure optimal health, quality of life, and efficient use of healthcare resources. Improving the evidence to guide the use of protein substitute in PKU is helpful not only for the treatment of PKU, but as a model for the treatment of other aminoacidopathies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusions can be made about the short- or long-term use of protein substitute in PKU due to the lack of adequate trial data. Current practice in the use of protein substitute should continue to be observed and monitored with care until further evidence is available from current and future included trials. Likewise, people with PKU should continue to take the amount of protein substitute as advised by their healthcare professionals.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large RCTs are needed to investigate the use of protein substitute in PKU. Due to the relatively small numbers of people with this condition, it is recommended that a multicentre approach be adopted. It is important that both long- and short-term outcomes are considered in future trials. To assist in ensuring the appropriateness of future trials, it would be useful to involve people with PKU and their caregivers in the design of the trials.</P>
