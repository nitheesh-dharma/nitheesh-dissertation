<TITLE>Regular antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in young children with sickle cell disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:09:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effects of prophylactic antibiotic regimens for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People living with SCD are especially prone to respiratory and blood infections. These infections are often caused by a germ (bacteria) known as <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</I> otherwise known as pneumococcus, which can cause many types of serious illnesses. Individuals with SCD can get infections more easily than unaffected persons because their spleen (organ that filters blood) does not work correctly, and also because damaged tissue and bone resulting from SCD can harbour bacteria. Infection prevention is therefore one of the major ways to improve the health of persons living with SCD and reduce the risk of death. The highest risk of infection occurs in children under three years old, but the special vaccines that help to prevent illnesses with <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>are of limited use in this young population. Therefore, regular antibiotics in addition to these special vaccines are needed to prevent infection. As risk of infection decreases with age, there might be a time when preventative antibiotic treatment can be discontinued.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 19 December 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We gathered evidence for this Cochrane Review by examining three clinical trials with over 800 children included.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All three clinical trials showed a reduced rate of pneumococcal infection in children with SCD receiving penicillin preventatively. Two of these trials looked at whether treatment was effective. The third trial followed on from one of the early trials and looked at when it was safe to stop treatment. Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. However, there were problems with children keeping to the treatment schedule and with the development of antibiotic resistance. The quality of the evidence for both primary and secondary outcomes (end result) was judged to be low.</P>
<P>We conclude that penicillin given preventatively reduces the rate of pneumococcal infections in children with SCD under five years of age. The risk of infection in older children is lower, and the follow-on trial did not show a significant increase in risk when regular penicillin was halted at five years old. Further research is needed to look at how commonly bacteria develop that are resistant to treatment and how clinically important this is.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) are particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2014.</P>

<P>To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD in relation to:</P>
<P>1. incidence of infection;</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-04-26 10:53:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform. Additionally, we carried out handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search: 19 December 2016<I>.</I>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-04-26 10:53:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-10-04 10:37:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:09:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Five trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials (880 children randomised) met the inclusion criteria. All of the included trials showed a reduced incidence of infection in children with SCD (SS or S&#946;0Thal) receiving prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-quality evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-quality evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:10:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The evidence examined suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:16:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:10:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic haemoglobin disorder, caused by inheritance from both parents of an altered beta-globin chain gene. The abnormal haemoglobin within red blood cells causes them to deform when they give up oxygen. These dense, sickle shaped cells are easily destroyed, leading to haemolytic anaemia, thus oxygen carriage is reduced. They can also adhere to the lining of the blood vessels, which results in tissue and organ damage leading to complications, such as severe pain crises, stroke and splenic infarction. Approximately 60,000 African-Americans, 10,000 persons in the UK and one in 60 persons in West Africa now suffer from the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickman 1999</LINK>). Globally, there are 250,000 new births with SCD per year. Despite improved care and services for people with SCD in developed countries, the average life expectancy for men and women with homozygous disease (SS) is 42 years and 48 years respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1994</LINK>). Infection is the major cause of death in children under the age of three years (<LINK REF="REF-Leikin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leikin 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Persons living with SCD are particularly susceptible to infection, most commonly infections of the respiratory tract and septicaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>). This is partly due to splenic dysfunction, which reduces the ability of the immune system to clear circulating antigens. In addition, abnormalities have been suggested in components of the immune system such as complement, immunoglobulins, leucocyte function and cell-mediated immunity, further disabling the response to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>). Tissue damage and bone necrosis may also harbour infectious agents. These abnormalities result in an increased risk of encapsulated bacterial infections such as pneumococcus, and an increase in <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> (<I>H influenzae</I>), <I>Neiserria meningitidis</I>, <I>Staphylococcus aureus </I>and <I>Escherischia coli </I>septicaemias (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are different forms of SCD, depending on inheritance of various mutated genes which result in differing types of haemoglobin genotypes. If the S gene is inherited from both parents the child will have homozygous SCD (SS), whereas inheritance from one parent in combination with a different altered beta-globin chain gene can lead to many other forms of the disease. The most common are haemoglobin SC disease (SC), haemoglobin S-beta thalassaemia zero (S&#946;0Thal) and haemoglobin S-beta thalassaemia plus (S&#946;+Thal). People with each of these diseases are affected to different extents with the symptoms of SCD, but susceptibility to infection is most apparent with SS and S&#946;0Thal.</P>
<P>Infection occurs in persons with SCD from infancy, with the highest risk before the age of three years, and significantly lower risk in older children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zarkowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarkowsky 1986</LINK>). Although comprehensive vaccination programmes are in place in developed countries, some vaccines, in particular the customary pneumococcal vaccines (unconjugated polysaccharide capsular antigen), are of limited use in children less than three years old due to suboptimal antibody responses. While it has been noted that early diagnosis and treatment of SCD has decreased mortality and morbidity rates in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1995</LINK>), the 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' (<LINK REF="REF-Leikin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leikin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zarkowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarkowsky 1986</LINK>) observed that from 1980 to 1981 the incidence of pneumococcal septicaemia in children under three years old was 10 per 100 patient years, with a 30% fatality rate. Approximately 4.5% of the children in the trial experienced at least one episode of bacteremia (<LINK REF="REF-Zarkowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarkowsky 1986</LINK>). As a result of the vulnerability of children to pneumococcal infection, an effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen is needed.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-10-19 23:06:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Possible regimens to prevent pneumococcal infection involve daily oral use or monthly intramuscular injections of penicillin. Compliance with prophylactic antibiotics is poor in many areas (<LINK REF="STD-Berkovitch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkovitch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 1991</LINK>) and resistance (pneumococcal) could occur through prolonged or intermittent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Chesney-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesney 1992</LINK>), potentially resulting in greater morbidity and mortality. Penicillins can also result in hypersensitivity reactions including, rarely, anaphylaxis and encephalopathy, which can be fatal (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2001</LINK>). However, serious adverse drug reactions are unusual.</P>
<P>As children get older they have a reduced risk of pneumococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lobel-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobel 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1966</LINK>). Therefore, there is a possibility that a prophylactic regimen could be modified or stopped later in childhood. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:10:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The purpose of this review was to determine if prophylactic antibiotics are effective in preventing pneumococcal infection. In addition we aimed to explore if there is an appropriate age when treatment can be safely withdrawn, without increasing the risk of infection. We also examined whether there are any potential adverse effects of long-term prophylaxis on the individual or in the community. This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Five trials (880 randomised children) were found of which three met the predefined inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one trial, 265 children with homozygous sickle cell disease were recruited from outpatient clinics of the University Hospital of the West Indies, and 23 subsequently withdrew (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). Children with a previous history of pneumococcal infection or splenectomy were excluded. Children were aged between six months and 36 months at recruitment. They were randomised into one of four groups, to receive monthly intramuscular penicillin injections or nothing, plus either pneumococcal vaccine or <I>H influenzae</I> type B vaccine. Penicillin prophylaxis was withdrawn at the age of three years, as the authors thought that older children might not be compliant to the painful injections, although these participants were still analysed in the groups to which they had been assigned. The trial lasted for five years. A misprint in the primary publication made treatment group numbers difficult to establish, as the numbers given do not add up to the trial cohort. However, the authors were contacted and the numbers confirmed (37 in the group receiving <I>H influenzae</I> type B vaccine alone, rather than 27 as printed).</P>
<P>The 'Prophylaxis with Oral Penicillin in Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia' clinical trial was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial. A total of 215 children with homozygous SCD from the USA were randomised to receive oral prophylactic penicillin, 125 mg twice daily, or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). They were aged between three months and 36 months at the start of the trial, and all had pneumococcal vaccination at one and two years of age. Children were excluded from the trial if they were receiving long-term transfusion therapy or antibiotics, or if they were allergic to penicillin. The trial was terminated eight months earlier than scheduled, after the occurrence of 15 cases of pneumococcal septicaemia, 13 in the placebo group and two in the penicillin group, showing an 84% reduction in pneumococcal septicaemia with penicillin prophylaxis (P = 0.0025).</P>
<P>A further trial in the USA by the same group, aimed to evaluate the consequences of discontinuing penicillin prophylaxis in children with SS or S&#946;0 sickle cell disease at the age of five years (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). A small proportion of children was involved in both PROPS and PROPS II (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). Children with a previous history of pneumococcal infection or splenectomy were excluded. A total of 400 children were randomised to either continue on penicillin prophylaxis, or have it replaced with an identical placebo, to determine the incidence of pneumococcal infection on stopping penicillin at age five years. The children were all around five years old (mean 5.1 years) and had been taking penicillin prophylactically for at least two years. All children had received pneumococcal vaccination within the 12 months preceding the start of the trial.</P>

<P>It is critical to examine the quality of evidence provided by each included RCT. The risk of bias assessment has been expanded in this review update. Each specific type of bias is outlined and a judgement made. Evidence supporting the likelihood that a particular type of bias may be present is provided by referring to the particular area of text as was published. Additionally, for this update, a new domain of risk bias assessment has been added, this domain looks at selective reporting (reporting bias).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>In the John trial, participants were randomised a total of 265 children were randomised to the four study groups. No details were given of the method of randomization (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). We are therefore unable to fully assess the risk of selection bias. Therefore, the adequacy of sequence generation is classified as 'unclear risk'.</P>
<P>In the first PROPS trial, the PROPS data co-ordinating center generated the randomization numbers for each clinical site and with the help of the program office, directed patient - entry assignments by means of telephone contact. Sealed envelopes that were stored at the clinical centres were available as a back up for randomization when telephone contact was not possible, but they were rarely used. The randomization schedules were prepared with the use of blocked randomization within each clinic to ensure balance in numbers between two groups (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). The method of randomization is clearly stated hence this study is therefore considered to have a 'low risk' of bias for this domain.</P>
<P>In a further PROPS trial, randomisation was by permuted block method, stratified by clinical site and years of previous penicillin use (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). The risk associated with the adequacy of random sequence generation was 'low risk'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>In the John trial, it was reported that the group allocation was changed due to the protocol for injected penicillin prophylaxis groups being inconvenient to some families who lived at remote addresses, or due to age of participants at recruitment so that the duration of penicillin treatment would have been too short to assess (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). A total of 16 participants (6.6%) were therefore reassigned to groups which did not receive penicillin prophylaxis. The groups were uneven, with significantly more participants in the penicillin groups (143 in penicillin group compared to 99 in control group). We have therefore classified this as 'high risk' for this domain.</P>
<P>In the first PROPS study, a central co-ordinating centre directed participant entry assignment over the telephone (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). Sealed envelopes were also held at the clinical centres in case the central office could not be reached, to maintain allocation concealment. Therefore, we have assessed the risk of bias for allocation concealment as 'low risk'.</P>
<P>In a further PROPS trial, randomisation was by permuted block method, stratified by clinical site and years of previous penicillin use (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). It was unclear whether allocation concealment had been performed and we have therefore assessed this trial as having an 'unclear risk' of bias for this domain.</P>

<P>The John trial was not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). This clinical trial is considered to be at a low risk for performance bias as the lack of blinding is is not likely to affect outcome.</P>
<P>In the first PROPS trial, the participants and centre personnel were blinded to allocation, and placebo tablets looked almost identical to penicillin (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). Therefore, this trial is considered low risk for performance bias.</P>
<P>In the further PROPS trial identical placebo tablets were used to maintain double blinding of the participants and centre personnel, therefore, this trial was also considered to be at a low risk for performance bias (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the John trial, full baseline data for participant characteristics were not given (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). "The trial was terminated prematurely in 25 children owing to splenectomy in 20, emigration in four, and the clinical decision to use prophylactic penicillin in one child with recurrent pneumococcal meningitis In these cases results up to the time of leaving the study were included in the analysis. There were seven deviations from the protocol caused by refusal to take penicillin after two and four injections (two), death before institution of randomised treatment (one), failure to treat with penicillin because of an error in age (one), inadvertent administration of penicillin to patients joining the study between 31 and 35 months of age (two), and removal to an inaccessible address, so that penicillin had to be stopped (one)." Aditionally, The study groups were also uneven with more participants in the penicillin group (143 in the penicillin group compared to 90 in the control group) and an "Intention to treat analysis was also undertaken" after participants were reassigned to protocol groups. Therefore, we have assessed the risk of bias due to attrition as 'high risk'.</P>
<P>In the 1986 PROPS trial, 219 participants were recruited from 23 centres throughout the USA (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). Four participants subsequently withdrew due to revisions of diagnosis, but 23 of these were subsequently withdrawn, mostly due to revision of genotype; these individuals had no severe infections and were not included in subsequent analyses. The trial was terminated early due to extreme results. There is therefore a possibility that the reported results may have been over-estimated and the risk of attrition bias was assessed as 'high risk'.</P>
<P>In the further PROPS trial, 400 participants were recruited from 18 centres in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). The characteristics of participants in each group were similar at baseline. Four children died after randomisation, but other withdrawals are not reported, and it is unclear whether an intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken.

There was an overall incidence of six pneumococcal isolations in 99 participants (280 patient years at risk) in the placebo groups, compared to seven events in 143 participants (400 patient years at risk) in the penicillin groups (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>), odds ratio (OR) 0.80 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.45) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, all of these latter events occurred after the participants had stopped taking penicillin after their third birthday.</P>
<P>In the PROPS trial there were two cases of confirmed pneumococcal infection in 105 participants in the penicillin group compared to 13 of 110 in the placebo group (P = 0.0025, quoted from trial article), OR 0.14 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.66) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>Meta-analysis for these two trials, which addressed initiation of treatment, had an OR of 0.37 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.86) (low-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) showing a significant reduction of pneumococcal infection in those children treated with penicillin (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children in one of the trials also received either pneumococcal vaccination or <I>H influenzae</I> type B (Hib) vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). Since the groups were unbalanced in numbers, differences in the infection rates between the vaccination groups could affect the results of analysis of penicillin versus no penicillin. However, analysis of infection rate in children receiving pneumococcal vaccination and HIB vaccination showed no statistical difference (test for subgroup differences: Chi = 0.36, df = 1 (P = 0.55), I = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), therefore it does not seem that the imbalance of participants between these groups should affect the overall analysis of penicillin versus no penicillin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Penicillin prophylaxis versus withdrawal of penicillin prophylaxis</HEADING>
<P>In the PROPS II trial, which investigated withdrawal of penicillin prophylaxis compared to continuing, two events of pneumococcal infection occurred in the penicillin group, and four in the placebo group, OR 0.49 (95% CI 0.09 to 2.71) (low-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). In addition, there was a case of <I>H influenzae</I> in each group, a case of salmonella in the penicillin group, and two cases of group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). The difference between infection frequencies between the groups was therefore not statistically significant.</P>

<P>In the PROPS trial, there were no deaths due to pneumococcal infection in the penicillin group, but three in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). In addition, one child in the placebo group died as a result of fulminant <I>H influenzae</I>, OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.11) (low-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Shortly after termination of the trial another child, from the penicillin group, also died from infection. Analysis of pneumococcal deaths only also has wide overall CIs, OR 0.15 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.85) (not shown in graph) (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the PROPS II trial, no deaths were associated directly with infection, but there were two fatalities in the penicillin group due to acute sickle chest syndrome, and two in the placebo group due to stroke, OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.14 to 7.10) (low-quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">All results</HEADING>
<P>No significant difference in number of deaths between participants treated with penicillin prophylaxis and those not treated is seen for either initiation or withdrawal of penicillin. The wide CIs in both trials indicate considerable uncertainty between a highly protective effect and a large increase in risk of death. This uncertainty reflects the small number of deaths in these two trials, and thus for more conclusive data on all causes of mortality larger or longer trials are required.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:16:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The PROPS trial was a well-conducted trial, including 215 children with homozygous SCD (SS), and shows a significantly reduced risk of pneumococcal infection in those receiving prophylactic penicillin (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). Due to the early termination of the trial, there is a possibility that the reported results may have been over-estimated and the risk of attrition bias was assessed as 'high risk'. The results of the John trial appear to support these findings in a different population, than the West Indies, and using a different dose and route of administration, with no cases of pneumococcal infection occurring in those children who were receiving penicillin (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). Accordingly, most advisory health committees recommend early diagnosis of sickle cell disease in order that penicillin prophylaxis can be commenced in infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 2000</LINK>). The PROPS II trial</P>
<P>The PROPS II trial (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>) followed on from the first PROPS trial (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>) to answer another important clinical question: if penicillin prophylaxis is to be given routinely to children with sickle cell disease, when is it safe to stop? The trial authors randomised SS and S&#946;0Thal children to withdrawal or continuation of penicillin prophylaxis at five years of age, as previous studies have shown that the risk of infection is lower in older pre-school children (<LINK REF="REF-Zarkowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarkowsky 1986</LINK>). Findings in the PROPS trial showed a risk of pneumococcal infection of 1.5 per 100 patient years in those receiving penicillin, and 9.8 per 100 patient years in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). In contrast, rates were significantly less in the PROPS II trial, with only 0.67 per 100 patient years in the placebo group, and half that in the penicillin group (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). Thus rates of infection after the age of five years are shown to be lower, whether or not the child receives penicillin, and therefore children with sickle cell anemia who have neither had a prior severe pneumococcal infection or a splenectomy and are receiving comprehensive care may safely stop prophylactic penicillin therapy at 5 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). without a clinically important increase in the risk of infection. For comparison, rates of invasive pneumococcal infection in the general non-sickle population in the USA are 0.0232 per 100 patient years, and 0.0352 per 100 patient years in the two to four year age group, dropping to 0.0039 after the age of five years (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>). In the trial by John, penicillin was stopped at three years of age (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). A cluster of four cases of pneumococcal infections occurred within 11 months of this, perhaps suggesting that these children are still very susceptible to infection, and that penicillin should be continued until they are older.</P>
<P>Adverse effects reported in the included trials were minimal. Compliance with the daily oral penicillin regimen is, however, known to be poor (<LINK REF="STD-Berkovitch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkovitch 1998</LINK>). The PROPS trial attempted to quantify the levels of compliance through pill counts and urine analysis, but too few data were collected for any conclusions to be drawn (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). Monthly intramuscular injections of penicillin overcome the problem of not taking pills, but require regular monthly interactions with the healthcare system. A lack of compliance with keeping these appointments is a real problem, particularly in rural, under-resourced areas. Additionally, the pain caused by intramuscular injections may not be acceptable to older children (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). Also, there is some uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the depot preparations in the second half of the four-week period (<LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 1982</LINK>), although this did not seem to present a clinical problem in the included trial (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Increasingly, the concern of antibiotic resistance is an issue for long-term antibiotic use. Infective organisms, which are resistant to antibiotics, are a growing problem in all areas of health care, and, although the impact of prophylactic antibiotic therapy on resistance is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Anglin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anglin 1984</LINK>), in general prolonged antimicrobial therapy is not encouraged (<LINK REF="REF-Pai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pai 2000</LINK>). In the PROPS II trial resistant organisms were isolated (<LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). Observational studies have also shown a high level of colonization of resistant organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Daw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daw 1997</LINK>). In practice, the risks of pneumococcal infection to the individual should be balanced against the problem of resistant organisms to the population.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:05:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The results of the trial by John show that a prophylactic penicillin regimen is also feasible in resource-limited countries (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). The cost is variable but this has been quoted at a median cost of USD 0.31 for 2.4 million IU vials of powdered benzathine benzylpenicillin in a 2010 report from the United Nations Children's Fund (<LINK REF="REF-Wyber-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyber 2013</LINK>). Also, monthly injections may aid compliance, providing individuals attend clinics regularly. The practicalities of implementing such a program in very rural and remote or under-resourced areas were illustrated in the trial, as several participants had to be moved from the penicillin groups due to inability to reach a medical centre every month. Children in different countries are exposed to different environmental factors, viral/bacterial risks and access to other medicines. This must be borne in mind when applying results of trials to difference settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:57:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Three studies were eligible for inclusion, with sample sizes ranging from 215 to 400 children (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-II-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS II 1995</LINK>). The findings of the first PROPS trial was not in conflict with, but supported the results of, the John trial (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>). Of note, the route of administration for both trials differed, in the earlier trial the parenteral route was chosen, while in the latter trial penicillin was given orally. Additionally, during the John trial, which was five years in duration, penicillin was terminated after each child's third birthday. This may have been a limitation of this trial. It was, however, noted that for the period of administration of intramuscular penicillin, children on this arm of the study had no pneumococcal infections. The quality of the evidence for both primary and secondary outcomes were judged to be low, see summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial reports of the first PROPS trial provided a rigorous risk of bias assessment and all risk of bias domains could be adequately assessed. The risk of bias assessment showed that in regards to the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROPS-1986" TYPE="STUDY">PROPS 1986</LINK>) ,there were some domains which were unclear, mainly due to inadequate reporting of the methods of randomization and allocation concealment and also in the reporting of outcome data (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). A high risk of bias as a result of allocation concealment (one of three studies) and incomplete outcome (one of three studies) was also reported. The existence of other sources of bias apart from those discussed and illustrated was not proven during the conduct of this review.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-06 13:57:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>It is known that there was potential for bias to be introduced into the review and one of the ways the authors sought to reduce bias, as a result of study selection, was to have clear inclusion criteria to guide the extensive search strategy which was undertaken, This extensive search with suitable terminology increased the likelihood that all relevant studies were identified,</P>
<P>The methods used in assessing the risk of bias was one of the strengths of this review. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool provided a clear and uniform protocol for a rigorous 'risk of bias' assessment. Additionally, a two author review of the risk of bias allowed for greater reliability of this assessment.</P>
<P>One limitation of this review is that limitations in the reporting of the methodology did not allow complete risk of bias assessment for all studies. Where possible, the review authors tried to contact trial authors for clarifications, which assisted in the process and reduced the instances of an unclear assessment.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:58:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In the included trials, the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccines in children with SCD was questioned. A Cochrane Review has been undertaken to investigate pneumococcal vaccines in sickle cell disease (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>). For polysaccharide vaccines, two included trials found no evidence that incidence of pneumococcal infection was reduced in young children (under three years old) receiving the vaccine, but they were associated with increased minor adverse reactions. For the more recently introduced conjugate pneumococcal vaccines, there was evidence from three trials of an increased immune response, but no trials were identified which investigated the incidence of pneumococcal infections in children specifically with sickle cell disease (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>). However, trials undertaken in healthy children and children with HIV did demonstrate a significant decrease in risk (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klugman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klugman 2003</LINK>). Such recent improvements in pneumococcal vaccines may reduce the requirement for antibiotic prophylaxis.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Penicillin prophylaxis reduces the incidence of pneumococcal infections in children with sickle cell disease (SS or S&#946;0Thal) under the age of five years. The risk of infection in children older than five years is lower, and the PROPS II trial did not show a significant increase in the risk on withdrawal of prophylactic penicillin at this age. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Observational data may help to elucidate the risk of infection in children when penicillin prophylaxis is withdrawn. In addition, further research into prevalence and clinical importance of resistant organisms is needed.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of 265 children were randomised to the four study groups, but 23 of these were subsequently withdrawn, mostly due to revision of genotype.</P>
<P>"The trial was terminated prematurely in 25 children owing to splenectomy in 20, emigration in four, and the clinical decision to use prophylactic penicillin in one child with recurrent pneumococcal meningitis In these cases results up to the time of leaving the study were included in the analysis. There were seven deviations from the protocol caused by refusal to take penicillin after two and four injections (two), death before institution of randomised treatment (one), failure to treat with penicillin because of an error in age (one), inadvertent administration of penicillin to patients joining the study between 31 and 35 months of age (two), and removal to an inaccessible address, so that penicillin had to be stopped (one)." Aditionally, the study groups were also uneven with more participants in the penicillin group (143 in the penicillin group compared to 90 in the control group) and an "Intention to treat analysis was also undertaken" after participants were reassigned to protocol groups.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>219 participants were recruited from 23 centres throughout the USA. Four participants subsequently withdrew due to revisions of diagnosis of genotype; these patients had no severe infections but were not included in subsequent analyses. The baseline characteristics of the children in each group, including history of palpable spleen or infection, were similar. The trial was terminated early due to extreme results. Because of this, there is a possibility that the reported results may be over-estimated.</P>
