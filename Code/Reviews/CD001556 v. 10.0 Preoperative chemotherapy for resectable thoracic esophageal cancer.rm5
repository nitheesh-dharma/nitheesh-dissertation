<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>In patients who have cancer of the esophagus that is potentiallly removable by surgery, does the use of chemotherapy before surgery result in improved survival?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cancer of the esophagus often is not discovered until it is at quite an advanced stage. This means that even removing the tumor through surgery is not very successful, and many people die within five years. Chemotherapy (cancer-fighting drugs such as cisplatin) has been used before surgery to try to shrink the tumor, making it easier to operate on and stopping it from spreading. Therefore, chemotherapy may help people to live longer.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review included information from 13 randomized studies and combined results from 2122 patients to answer our question regarding survival.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review of 13 trials, including patients with esophageal cancer of any cell type, found some evidence that cisplatin-based chemotherapy may help them to live longer. However, chemotherapy may introduce side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>This review used information from randomized studies that is considered to represent the highest quality of evidence.</P>

<P>The primary outcome was survival, which was assessed with the use of hazard ratios. This is an amendment to the original review, which used risk ratios to assess survival at yearly intervals. Hazard ratios (HRs) have now been introduced to summarize the complete survival experience in a single analysis.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified a total of 13 randomized trials involving 2362 participants. Ten trials (2122 participants) reported sufficient detail on survival to be included in a meta-analysis for the primary outcome. Preoperative chemotherapy improves overall survival (HR 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.96) and is associated with a significantly higher rate of complete (R0) resection (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19).</P>
<P>No evidence suggests that the overall rate of resection (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01), tumor recurrence (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22) or nonfatal complications (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.06) was different for preoperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone. Trials reported risks of toxicity with chemotherapy that ranged from 11% to 90%.<BR/>

<P>In summary, preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery offers a survival advantage compared with surgery alone for patients with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer, but the evidence is of moderate quality.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-24 12:46:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Esophageal cancer is the sixth most frequent cause of cancer death and is responsible for more than 286,000 deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Pisani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisani 1999</LINK>). Age-standardized mortality rates (world population) in males range from 1.8 per 100,000 in West Africa to 19.8 per 100,000 in China and 28.9 per 100,000 in South Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Pisani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisani 1999</LINK>). Although it accounts for only 2.2% of all cancers, the incidence of esophageal cancer is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Cancer-Care-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cancer Care 2009</LINK>). Blot et al reported a greater than 100% increase in the occurrence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, and the rise in rate among white North American males has exceeded that of any other malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Blot-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blot 1991</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unfortunately, many patients present with widespread disease such that only palliative therapy is possible. Little controversy exists regarding treatment of this patient group; however, those who are potentially curable present as a challenge for both patient and physician. Surgery is the treatment of choice for most patients with localized esophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-DeMeester-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMeester 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lerut-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerut 1998</LINK>), but curative resection is possible in only 15% to 39% (<LINK REF="REF-Law-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lerut-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerut 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orringer-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orringer 1993a</LINK>). Failure of surgery to cure clinically localized esophageal cancer is due to the high frequency of lymph node involvement and distant metastases before symptoms occur. Preoperative (neoadjuvant or induction) chemotherapy has been used in an attempt to decrease tumor activity, increase resectability, and improve disease-free and overall survival. Treatment is aimed at eradicating micrometastatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Goldie-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldie 1984</LINK>) and potentially downstaging cancers to enhance resectability.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several studies have investigated whether preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery leads to improved cure rates, but individual reports have been conflicting. Six meta-analyses of randomized trials have been performed in an effort to resolve the dispute. The review by Bhansali et al of 12 randomized trials and eight historical control studies of chemotherapy, with and without radiation, found a gross overestimation of treatment effect in studies using historical controls as compared with randomized trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bhansali-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bhansali 1996</LINK>). These review authors found no survival benefit from cisplatin-based adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in esophageal cancer. Unfortunately, this review included a heterogeneous mix of trials that were exploring very different questions about the treatment of patients with esophageal cancer and should not have been combined. Our initial Cochrane review of preoperative chemotherapy for resectable esophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Malthaner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malthaner 2001</LINK>) concluded that no survival advantage was associated with chemotherapy. Subsequently, Urschel et al summarized 11 randomized trials of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancer and similarly concluded that no survival benefit was apparent for chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Urschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Urschel 2002</LINK>). The Medical Research Council (MRC) has published the largest randomized trial to date, which found a dramatically significant survival advantage for individuals treated with preoperative chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>). Our subsequent Cochrane review concluded that preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery appeared to offer a late (five-year) survival advantage compared with surgery alone for resectable thoracic esophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Malthaner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malthaner 2003</LINK>). However, induction chemotherapy has associated toxicity and treatment morbidity that may contribute to perioperative mortality. Kaklamanos and colleagues summarized seven trials and concluded that a modest survival advantage is suggested for patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, as compared with surgery alone (<LINK REF="REF-Kaklamanos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaklamanos 2003</LINK>). An apparent increase in treatment-related mortality was noted, mainly for patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Gebski and colleagues summarized eight randomized controlled trials that compared survival benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone (<LINK REF="REF-Gebski-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gebski 2007</LINK>). Results of this analysis suggest an overall survival benefit at two years with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery compared with surgery alone.</P>
<P>In all reviews conducted before 2005, estimates at yearly time points were used when trials were combined. When a randomized controlled trial with survival-type data is described, it is recommended that appropriate summary statistics include the log hazard ratio and its variance (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). The log hazard ratio has been specifically designed for comparison of two survival curves, because it is the only summary statistic that allows for both censoring and time to an event. A method that compares the numbers of events in each group or the odds of survival at one or two fixed points in time is inefficient and could lead to inappropriate conclusions. An explicit systematic update of the role of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer using hazard ratios (HRs) was therefore warranted. Our subsequent Cochrane review presented data as a summary HR, and review authors concluded that preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery may offer a survival advantage over surgery alone, but that the evidence was still inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Malthaner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malthaner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the publication of our most recent Cochrane review, a large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>) and updates of two large previously published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>) have been published, demonstrating a survival advantage of chemotherapy plus surgery over surgery alone. In addition, a large individual patient meta-analysis, considered to represent the highest level of evidence, was reported in abstract form, demonstrating a small, but significant, benefit of chemotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone for both overall and disease-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2007</LINK>). In light of these new data, an update of our previous review is warranted.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As planned in the protocol, we used a scale validated for assessing the quality of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). This scale assesses the methods used for randomization, blinding and handling of dropouts in a trial. Two review authors independently evaluated trials meeting the inclusion criteria by using the Jadad method. Each appraiser was given a scoring sheet that included a detailed description of the scoring system. We resolved discrepancies by consensus. We did not use the scores to weigh the results in any way. We used quality scores to categorize trials in the sensitivity analysis. This type of scoring system is associated with danger of confusing the quality of reporting of trials with the quality of the trial design. We used this scale cautiously and with reservations.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the primary outcome of survival, we extracted HRs and their standard errors, when possible, for each trial. When these were not reported directly, we estimated the HR and associated statistics by using an Excel spreadsheet developed by Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London.</P>
<P>We used the HR to compare survival, so the complete survival experience can be summarized in a single statistic. This was an amendment to the original protocol and review, wherein survival was compared by using risk ratios (RRs) at five time points at yearly intervals. The amendment means that the primary outcome can now be analyzed using a single test, reducing the risk of spurious false-positive results obtained from multiple testing. An HR summarizes the survival rate over the entire period of follow-up and so can be used to estimate the treatment effect at any time point. The HR is a measure of risk of death in the treatment group (preoperative chemotherapy and surgery) versus the control group (surgery alone), such that a number less than one favors treatment. Secondary outcomes of local and distant recurrences may also have been analyzed using HRs, but unfortunately very few trials reported a time-to-event analysis of these outcomes, so they were summarized using RRs.</P>
<P>Resection was defined as any resection - curative or palliative. Complete resection was defined as absence of microscopic disease at the resection margins (R0). Response to chemotherapy was defined as a clinical decrease in the size of the tumor while a complete (pathologic) response occurred, when no microscopic disease was found in the resected specimen. Local-regional recurrence was defined as isolated local recurrence, and distant recurrence was defined as recurrence only at a distant site. Local and distant recurrence occurred when tumors were found at both locations. Preoperative death was defined as death occurring before surgery, and postoperative death included 30-day mortality and death occurring during the same hospitalization period. Anastomotic leaks included both clinical and radiographic leaks. Pulmonary complications included pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. Cardiac complications included dysrhythmia, infarction, and congestive failure. Infection involved the wound, the urinary tract, or sepsis. Quality of life results included any assessment of dysphagia.</P>
<P>The risk ratio (RR) was the measure of effect for rates of resection, tumor recurrences, and treatment morbidity and mortality. It was selected as the most 'user friendly' outcome for participants and clinicians. The RR was calculated as treatment (preoperative chemotherapy and surgery) versus control (surgery alone), such that a number greater than one favored treatment for good outcomes (resection rate), and a number less than one favored treatment for bad outcomes (recurrence, morbidity). Each outcome (HR or RR) is presented as a point estimate along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) and P value.</P>

<P>We assessed the heterogeneity of trial results by using a visual plot as described by L'Abbe (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abbe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbe 1987</LINK>) and by conducting formal statistical testing. We assessed clinical homogeneity by examining baseline and demographic variables to ensure that studies included similar populations. Qualitatively, we examined tables of comparisons and graphic displays of trial outcomes to look for similarities. We summarized outcomes by using HRs and RRs. We examined the plots to identify possible outliers and to explore trends in outcomes due to differences in methods, participant populations, or interventions.</P>
<P>We carried out a formal test of heterogeneity by using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (Q) for homogeneity, as described by Peto (<LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1994</LINK>), as well as the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The number of degrees of freedom of Q was equal to the number of studies minus one. An arbitrary P value &lt; 0.1 for the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test or I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50% or both were selected to denote potential lack of homogeneity such that care was needed in interpreting the results.</P>

<P>We combined data from various trials by calculating a pooled estimate of HRs and RRs using The Review Manager software of The Cochrane Collaboration. We used the more conservative random-effects model, as specified in the protocol, because clinical heterogeneity among trials was observed (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). The main analysis included all trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria, wherever the relevant outcome was reported. This was possible for the primary outcome of survival and for secondary outcomes of resection, rates of resection, tumor recurrences, and greatest number of treatment morbidities. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to determine whether conclusions were changed when different trials were included in the analysis: Inclusion criteria were varied and the analysis repeated.</P>

<P>This review is based on 13 randomized trials and 2307 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ancona-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ancona 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baba-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Law-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Law 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maipang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maipang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlag-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Schlag 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stilidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stilidi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Sample sizes in the included trials ranged from 36 to 802 participants. One trial, which was reported only in abstract form, found a disease-free survival advantage for chemotherapy but reported percent survival only at three years (<LINK REF="STD-Stilidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stilidi 2006</LINK>). Roth et al randomly assigned 39 participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus from a single center (<LINK REF="STD-Roth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1988</LINK>). The experimental group received cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin chemotherapy before surgery, and cisplatin and vindesine after surgery, and control groups underwent surgery alone. This is the only included trial in which all participants received postoperative chemotherapy in addition to preoperative chemotherapy. Study authors reported no overall difference in survival but a survival benefit in the subgroup of participants who responded to chemotherapy and did not have weight loss greater than 10%. This post hoc subgroup analysis must be interpreted with caution because it involved small numbers of participants and limited power. Postoperative complications and resectability rates were similar in these groups. This small study used an old chemotherapy protocol. Bleomycin is toxic to the lungs and is no longer used for treatment of patients with esophageal cancer.</P>
<P>In a multicenter Scandinavian trial, Nygaard et al randomly assigned 186 participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus to four treatment groups: Group 1, surgery alone; Group 2, preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and bleomycin and surgery; Group 3, preoperative radiation (35 Gy) and surgery; or Group 4, preoperative chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1992</LINK>). Reported three-year survival was significantly higher in the pooled groups receiving radiotherapy as compared with the pooled groups not receiving radiotherapy. No significant difference in survival was noted in the group given preoperative chemotherapy versus group not given chemotherapy. Only Groups 1 and 2 were analyzed in this review. This was another small study that used the outdated bleomycin chemotherapy.</P>
<P>In another single-center trial from Germany, Schlag randomly assigned 46 participants with squamous cell carcinoma to receive surgery alone or preoperative cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Schlag-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Schlag 1992a</LINK>). The chemotherapy did not influence resectability nor overall survival of participants with localized esophageal cancer, but it was associated with considerable side effects and a high postoperative mortality rate. This was also a small study, but investigators used a more current standard chemotherapy combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.</P>
<P>In the fourth trial, Maipang et al reported on a single-center experience from Thailand that included 24 randomly assigned participants with squamous cell carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Maipang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maipang 1994</LINK>). The experimental group received preoperative cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine followed by surgery, and the control group underwent surgery alone. Early survival appeared better in the control group, but overall survival time differences were not statistically significant. This was another small study that used bleomycin and contributed to the lack of encouraging results.</P>
<P>Law et al randomly assigned 147 participants with squamous cell carcinoma to preoperative cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil followed by surgery or surgery alone in Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-Law-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Law 1997</LINK>). They reported no differences in reported perioperative mortality and no overall reported survival advantage. Analysis of extracted data showed no differences at one year and at two years but significant improvement in survival with chemotherapy at three, four, and five years. Participants who responded to chemotherapy had improved survival, and nonresponding participants had increased mortality. Local-regional disease was reduced with chemotherapy. The complete pathologic response was only 7%.</P>
<P>The second-largest trial was a multicenter North American Intergroup trial (0013) that randomly assigned 467 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>). An update on the results of this trial was recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Kelsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelsen 2007</LINK>); however fewer participants were reported on in this update than in the original analysis, and the overall conclusions were unchanged. Therefore we have included the results of the original analysis in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>). Three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, were repeated postoperatively if participants responded. Participants with positive margins, residual disease, or recurrence may also have received radiation at the discretion of the investigator. Both adenocarcinoma (51%) and squamous cell carcinoma (44%) were included and randomization allocation was concealed at the coordinating center. No difference in survival was reported with or without preoperative chemotherapy. The only factor found to improve long-term survival was achievement of a complete (R0) resection.</P>
<P>Baba et al published on a randomized trial of 42 participants from Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2000</LINK>). They compared preoperative cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin for two cycles versus esophagectomy alone. Investigators found that T3 tumors fared poorly with chemotherapy, and a multivariate analysis identified that a partial response to the first course of chemotherapy was a favorable prognostic indicator. Study authors provided only data on distant and local recurrences and treatment complications. Unfortunately they presented no overall survival data. . We requested additional details from the study authors, but they have yet to respond.</P>
<P>Wang et al reported in Chinese on 100 participants randomly assigned to preoperative cisplatin chemotherapy versus surgery alone (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>). They found a significant survival advantage for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy at five years. Unfortunately, investigators did not provide details of chemotherapy, type of surgery, and other survival information. We contacted the trial authors and are awaiting their reply.</P>
<P>Ancona et al described a randomized single-center trial from Italy using preoperative cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy versus esophagectomy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Ancona-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ancona 2001</LINK>). The trial was stopped after 96 of an expected 240 participants were enrolled because of slow accrual. Researchers reported no overall survival benefit for chemotherapy except in participants who had a complete response.</P>
<P>The largest and most recent trial with a complete manuscript has now been published (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>). We have included updated long-term results from the original MRC trial. The Medical Research Council group randomly assigned 802 participants with squamous cell carcinoma (31%) and adenocarcinoma (66%) of the esophagus from 42 European centers to two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Nine percent received preoperative radiation as per local practice. Overall survival was better in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99; P value = 0.03).</P>
<P>Published in abstract form only, Stilidi et al reported on 78 participants randomly assigned at a single center to receive preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil plus esophagectomy or esophagectomy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Stilidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stilidi 2006</LINK>). Although investigators noted improvement in disease-free survival, they reported no statistically significant difference in three-year overall survival between the chemotherapy plus surgery group and the surgery group (62.9% vs 39.8%; P value = 0.08). Published results did not provide enough information for calculation of a hazard ratio, so it could not be included in our analysis of the primary outcome. Investigators reported the rate of R0 resection as higher in the chemotherapy plus surgery group (86.8%) than in the surgery alone group (65%; P value = 0.03). We contacted the study authors to ask for further details, and we are awaiting their reply. It appears that this trial is ongoing, as the abstract report states that accrual is continuing.</P>

Results of this trial showed a significant survival benefit among participants who received chemotherapy (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93), with no significant subgroup effect based on the site of the primary tumor (lower esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and stomach; P value for interaction = 0.25). Only 37 participants in the chemotherapy plus surgery arm and 36 in the surgery alone arm had lower rates of esophageal cancer (15%). A hazard ratio for survival among only participants with esophageal cancer could not be calculated; therefore the trial was not included for analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We observed clinical heterogeneity among the reported trials. All trials evaluated participants with squamous cell carcinoma, except for the largest trials reported by Kelsen and the MRC, as well as the Ychou trial, which also included adenocarcinoma (51%, 66%, and 100%, respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>). All trials used combination cisplatin chemotherapy and at least one other agent in the treatment arm. Seven trials used cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Ancona-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ancona 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baba-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Law-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Law 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlag-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Schlag 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>). Three trials used cisplatin in combination with bleomycin (<LINK REF="STD-Maipang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maipang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1988</LINK>). Maipang et al added vinblastine, and Roth et al added vindesine, to the combination. Boonstra et al used cisplatin with etoposide. It is unknown what Wang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>) added to cisplatin for their Chinese publication. Four trials included additional postoperative chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stilidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stilidi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dosages of cisplatin varied from 20 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> to 120 mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>per cycle, and the number of cycles varied from one to three. The most common dose of 5-fluorouracil was 1000 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for five days per cycle, but Law et al used 500 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for five days per cycle, Baba et al used 700 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for five days per cycle, and Stilidi et al used 425 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for three days per cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Law-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Law 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The surgical procedure most commonly used in all trials was transthoracic esophagectomy, which incorporated the stomach and rarely the colon for the transposition. Four trials also used a transhiatal approach for lower third and gastroesophageal junction tumors and in participants considered at high risk for a thoracotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Law-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Law 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>).

The mean score was 2.5. All trials were unfairly penalized for lack of blinding. It is clinically impossible to blind participants and clinicians to participants undergoing surgery and/or receiving chemotherapy. This is an unfortunate drawback for quality scores applied to surgical and oncology studies. However, when the primary outcome of interest is survival, blinding becomes less relevant. It must be emphasized that the quality score is based on published information and may not truly reflect methodology.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses concentrated on the primary outcome of overall survival.</P>
<P>Of the three trials that could not be included in analysis of the primary outcome, one study of 100 participants showed a survival advantage for the chemotherapy arm at five years (46% survival in the chemotherapy arm vs 32% in the surgery only arm ) (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>); one study of 78 participants reported no difference in overall percent survival at three years (62.9% in the chemotherapy + surgery group vs 27.7% in the surgery alone group; P value = 0.08) (<LINK REF="STD-Stilidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stilidi 2006</LINK>); and one study of 42 participants did not compare survival across the two arms of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2000</LINK>) but reported little difference between the two groups in terms of time to treatment failure. It seems unlikely that the data missing from these three trials would affect our results dramatically; if anything, it seems that they would strengthen the evidence in favor of chemotherapy.</P>
<P>The random-effects meta-analysis was used, as this was originally specified in the protocol. It is worth noting, however, that the result is sensitive to the model selected, and that when a fixed-effect analysis was performed, the estimate of the hazard ratio was almost unchanged, but the narrower confidence interval strengthens the evidence for a treatment effect (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97; P value = 0.01; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Multiple a priori sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the robustness of results. Just two trials judged to be of high quality used the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>). No significant difference in overall survival was seen with preoperative chemotherapy when only high-quality trials were considered (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19; P value = 0.60; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). The test for subgroup differences was not significant (P value = 0.40). Thus it appears that the lower-quality studies (according to the Jadad scale) may be driving the treatment effect. This is consistent with the direction of our a priori hypothesis.</P>
<P>Ychou et al included only adenocarcinoma. No significant difference in overall survival was observed with preoperative chemotherapy when only trials that included adenocarcinoma were considered (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; P value = 0.12; <LINK REF="CMP-005.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.5</LINK>). The test for subgroup differences was not significant (P value = 0.58). Thus it appears that trials of squamous cell cancer may be driving the treatment effect. However, this subgroup effect might reflect the fact that two of the three trials that included adenocarcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>) were the same two trials that had a Jadad score indicating high quality.</P>
<P>Four trials gave some postoperative chemotherapy in addition to preoperative treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ancona-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ancona 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>).

When these trials are excluded and only trials that gave preoperative chemotherapy alone were combined, very little change in the results was observed.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is based on 13 randomized trials with 2362 participants comparing preoperative chemotherapy versus surgery alone for resectable esophageal cancer. A survival advantage seems to be associated with chemotherapy. Sensitivity analyses suggest that low-quality studies as well as studies of squamous cell cancer as opposed to adenocarcinoma may be driving the survival advantage observed with preoperative chemotherapy. Sensitvity analyses also suggest that only trials performed after 1990 show a survival advantage with preoperative chemotherapy. These later trials used predominantly cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil-based regimens, in contrast to earlier trials. Although this is an interesting observation, we cannot infer on the basis of our findings alone that this chemotherapy regimen was the causal mechanism for the survival advantage. Sensitivity analyses indicate that perhaps the timing of chemotherapy does not matter, as long as it is given. That being said, this finding was based on study-level data; thus we cannot draw these conclusions without individual-participant meta-analysis. Depending on the outcome, between three and ten trials were available for each analysis. Some of the trials included in the analysis of survival are not included in the other analyses, and some of the trials included in the analysis of additional outcomes are not included in the analysis of survival. Nevertheless, results show a small benefit of chemotherapy, and inclusion of trials without survival data might lend greater weight to this. Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with significantly higher rates of complete (R0) resection, and this may be the mechanism by which preoperative chemotherapy confers a survival advantage. However, little from the recurrence data can support this mechanism for the apparent improvement in survival. Ultimately, data of better quality are needed. Morbidity data are also very limited, but an increase in toxicity is suggested with certain chemotherapeutic agents, so again data of better quality are needed. It is not possible with the current published data to speculate whether any patient subgroup defined by, for example, histology or stage might benefit more or less from chemotherapy. Individual patient data are needed to address this.</P>
<P>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not appear to alter the rate of resection, local or distant tumor recurrence, or postoperative complications. However, some preoperative toxicities and preoperative mortalities were reported. No strong conclusions can be made about effects of treatment on quality of life.</P>

<P>Although clinical heterogeneity among the trials was apparent, the most discordant results came from the two largest trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>). Much speculation has been documented in the literature as to why these two well-designed and high-quality trials produced such different outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bosset-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosset 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>). Both trials used cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil preoperatively, but the North American protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>) gave a higher dose of cisplatin (100 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> vs 80 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>), gave three cycles instead of two cycles, and administered chemotherapy postoperatively. Perhaps the higher total dose of chemotherapy was detrimental to patients who then underwent esophagectomy. It is also possible that the high perioperative mortality (10%) and the low median survival (13 months) reported in the surgery alone arm in the MRC trial may explain the difference. The median survival in the North American trial in the surgery alone arm was 16.1 months - almost equivalent to the 16.8 months reported in the chemotherapy arm of the MRC trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>). It is difficult to postulate why this might be, as the surgical techniques were decided on by each local surgeon and were not described in the published report.</P>
<P>Some participants (9%) in the MRC trial received preoperative radiation in addition to chemotherapy, and in the North American trial, an unknown number of participants received postoperative radiation when resection margins were positive. Although the MRC investigators claim that the number of participants who received preoperative radiation was insignificant, it certainly could contribute to the higher postoperative mortality seen in the surgery alone group. What effect postoperative radiation had in the North American trial remains speculative.</P>
<P>The trial completed by Cunningham et al compared preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone in participants with operable gastric, gastroesophageal, or lower esophageal cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2006</LINK>). Results of this trial show a significant survival benefit among participants who received chemotherapy, and the study authors concluded that among participants with operable gastric or lower esophageal cancer, perioperative chemotherapy significantly improved survival. This trial was excluded from our analysis, as we were unable to identify outcomes for participants with esophageal cancer alone. If included, this trial would strengthen our conclusion of a survival advantage with preoperative chemotherapy; however inclusion of results based primarily on participants with gastric cancer (74%) was believed to introduce too much clinical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>As planned in the protocol, we used the Jadad scale in assessing the quality of included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Newer methods for assessment of risk of bias have been presented by the Cochrane Group; however, in this limited update of our previous review (only one additional study), it was believed that retaining the protocol methods was appropriate. When a risk of bias assessment was completed for the included studies, the two studies judged to be of high quality according to the Jadad score (<LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>) were judged to have low risk of bias, and all other studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias. This confirms that our previous assessments based on study quality are likely accurate.</P>

<P>Our conclusions differ slightly from those presented in previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Malthaner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malthaner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malthaner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malthaner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Urschel 2002</LINK>). The conclusions provided by Urschel et al (<LINK REF="STD-Urschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Urschel 2002</LINK>) were similar to those of our initial review (<LINK REF="REF-Malthaner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malthaner 2001</LINK>). Our current review includes the updated results from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-Allum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MRC Allum 2009</LINK>) and one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ychou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ychou 2011</LINK>). As in our most recent update, this update reports a summary hazard ratio for overall survival. The methods of Parmar et al (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>) that have been used in this update assume a constant hazard, which seems a biologically plausible assumption. The findings of this review corroborate both qualitatively and quantitatively the findings reported by Ronellenfitsch et al in their recent meta-analysis combining aggregate and individual participant data (<LINK REF="REF-Ronellenfitsch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronellenfitsch 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The individual participant data meta-analysis published in abstract form by Thirion and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2007</LINK>) reported a significant benefit in overall survival with chemotherapy plus surgery when compared with surgery alone (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; P value = 0.003). As the study authors identify, this likely represents the highest level of evidence. Trial quality, however, is not reported in this abstract; therefore it is not possible yet to determine whether this represents data from high-quality trials, which would be considered the highest level of evidence, or from lower-quality trials, which may call into question these results. We are anticipating publication of this individual participant data meta-analysis so these results can be further evaluated in relation to the results reported here.</P>

<P>In summary, preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery appears to offer a survival advantage compared with surgery alone for resectable thoracic esophageal cancer of any histologic type, but we require further research. Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with significantly higher rates of complete (R0) resection. Based on the sometimes limited available data, no evidence suggests a difference in rate of resection, tumor recurrence, or postoperative morbidity. Any survival advantage with chemotherapy may be tempered by risks of toxicity and preoperative mortality. The most beneficial chemotherapy combination appears to be cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil-based; however this meta-analysis did not look at trials that compared chemotherapy combinations or dosing schedules.</P>
<P>Just as no clinical trial can provide a 'prescription' for how to treat individual cases, neither can a meta-analysis do this. Ultimately, decisions on the use of chemotherapy need to be made by the clinician and the patient together and will depend on many factors, including survival, toxicity, quality of life, and economic costs of treatment.</P>
<P>If survival is the principal endpoint, preoperative chemotherapy should be considered in patients with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer. A combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is probably most appropriate. No strong recommendation can be made about dosing or the number of cycles.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-24 11:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A meta-analysis of individual participant data comparing preoperative chemotherapy and surgery versus surgery alone has been performed and needs to be reported in the peer-reviewed literature (<LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2007</LINK>). As newer chemotherapeutic agents continue to be developed, they will need to be evaluated. Chemotherapy with radiation in conjunction with surgery should be examined both preoperatively and postoperatively. Future trials should include validated measures of quality of life and should report complications more fully. Hazard ratio should remain the standard measure for future time-to-event meta-analyses. The addition of radiation therapy to preoperative chemotherapy needs to be summarized. Future randomized trials should compare preoperative chemotherapy versus preoperative chemoradiation.</P>

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy regimen in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and to determine whether induction chemotherapy improves symptom- free period and survival in these patients compared to surgical treatment alone. Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy, cis-platinum 100 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, bleomycin 10 mg/m2 loading dose on day 3, followed by 10 mg/m2/day continuous intravenous infusion on days 4 through 7, and vinblastine 3 mg/m2 given intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22. The cycle was repeated on day 29. Fifteen patients completed 2 courses of chemotherapy and among these, 2 patients had a complete clinical response (13%), 6 (40%) had a partial response, and 7 patients (47%) had no response. Four patients died during chemotherapy treatment. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity (ECOG criteria) was observed in 47% (7/15) of patients. Twenty-two patients were randomized to conventional treatment (surgery alone). Median survival time was 17 months in both groups. However, early survival appeared to be better in the control group. Kaplan-Meier survivals at 6 months were 69% and 89% and at 3 years were 31% and 36% for the induction chemotherapy group and control group, respectively. The survival time differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.186). These findings demonstrate that although this chemotherapy regimen had some effect on squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, it did not improve survival. On the contrary, survival seems to be better in the control group. The 6-month survival discrepancy between both groups might be due to the poor nutritional status of our patients, who may better tolerate smaller dosages of chemotherapy 0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Combined). 11056-06-7 (Bleomycin). 15663-27-1 (Cisplatin). 865-21-4 (Vinblastine)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-10-08 14:16:19 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Patients were stratified by tumor size and location and by sex, with no significant differences appearing between the two treatment groups. Median follow-up for both groups was 30 months. The preoperative response rate to chemotherapy was 47%. The postoperative complication rate for patients in the operation- only group was 47%; it was 29% for patients receiving chemotherapy. The overall resectability rates were similar for the two groups. Patients responding to chemotherapy preoperatively had significantly prolonged survival (median greater than 20 months) when compared with either nonresponders (median 6.2 months) or patients receiving only operation (median 8.6 months). A highly significant correlation was noted between a weight loss of less than 10% and response to chemotherapy, which suggested that responses occurred in patients with less advanced disease. We conclude that preoperative and postoperative cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin chemotherapy has acceptable toxicity and does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications. The natural history of epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus is altered and overall survival is prolonged for patients responding to preoperative chemotherapy. Potential responding patients can be identified by the degree of preoperative weight loss 0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Combined). 11056-06-7 (Bleomycin). 15663-27-1 (Cisplatin). 53643-48-4 (Vindesine)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-10-08 14:18:48 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
