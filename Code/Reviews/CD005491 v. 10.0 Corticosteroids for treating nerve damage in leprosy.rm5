<TITLE>Corticosteroids for treating nerve damage in leprosy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:49:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are corticosteroids an effective treatment for nerve damage in leprosy?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Leprosy is a long-term infectious disease. Leprosy bacteria cause damage to the skin and peripheral nerves (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord). This damage can stop nerves from working normally and cause disability. Corticosteroids, especially prednisolone, are often used to treat nerve damage in leprosy, but their long-term effect is uncertain.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted a wide search for reports of clinical trials of treatments for nerve damage in leprosy. We found five clinical trials that met our criteria, involving 576 people with leprosy. Two of the included trials compared prednisolone with placebo. One of these trials, with 84 participants, recruited people who had mild abnormality of feeling of less than six months' duration and the other, with 95 participants, assessed treatment effects in people with abnormal nerve function of 6 to 24 months' duration. A third trial, with 334 participants, compared three 12-month corticosteroid regimens for severe type 1 reactions. Type 1 reactions are episodes in which nerves become inflamed. The fourth trial (21 participants) compared a low dose of prednisone with a high dose of prednisone for people with damage to the ulnar nerve (a nerve in the arm). The fifth trial (42 participants) compared intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone with intravenous normal saline and oral prednisolone in people with a type 1 leprosy reaction or abnormal nerve function of no more than six months' duration.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There was no important difference in improvement in nerve function between people treated with prednisolone or with placebo after one year, according to two trials. More people on a three-month course of prednisolone failed to respond to treatment and required extra corticosteroids compared to people on either a high-dose or a low-dose regimen of five months' duration. The trials comparing corticosteroids with placebo and a trial comparing intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone with intravenous normal saline and oral prednisolone found no differences in the occurrence of adverse events between groups. We considered the quality of the evidence to be moderate to low. Although trials were well conducted and designed, they were largely small and did not always use proven measures to capture the effects of corticosteroids.</P>
<P>The evidence in this review is up to date to June 2015.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-07 19:00:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 16 June 2015, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also checked clinical trials registers and contacted trial authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-01 19:42:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of corticosteroids for nerve damage in leprosy. The comparators were no treatment, placebo treatment, or a different corticosteroid regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:24:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The primary outcome was improvement in nerve function after one year. Secondary outcomes were change in nerve pain, limitations in activities of daily living, limitations in participation, and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. When data were lacking, we contacted trial authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>We included five RCTs involving 576 people. The trials were largely at low risk of bias, but we considered the quality of the evidence from these trials as moderate to low, largely due to imprecision from small sample sizes. Two out of the five trials reported on improvement in nerve function at one year. These two trials compared prednisolone with placebo. One trial, with 84 participants, treated mild sensory impairment of less than six months' duration, and the other, with 95 participants, treated nerve function impairment of 6 to 24 months' duration. There was no significant difference in nerve function improvement after 12 months between people treated with prednisolone and those treated with placebo. Adverse events were not reported significantly more often with corticosteroids than with placebo. The other three trials did not report on the primary outcome measure. One (334 participants) compared three corticosteroid regimens for severe type 1 reactions. No serious side effects of steroids were reported in any participant during the follow-up period. Another trial (21 participants) compared low-dose prednisone with high-dose prednisone for ulnar neuropathy. Two participants on the higher dose of prednisone reported adverse effects. The last (42 participants) compared intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone with intravenous normal saline and oral prednisolone. The trial found no significant differences between the groups in the occurrence of adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Corticosteroids are used for treating acute nerve damage in leprosy, but moderate-quality evidence from two RCTs treating either longstanding or mild nerve function impairment did not show corticosteroids to have a superior effect to placebo on nerve function improvement. A third trial showed significant benefit from a five-month steroid regimen over a three-month regimen in terms of response to treatment (need for additional corticosteroids). Further RCTs are needed to establish optimal corticosteroid regimens and to examine the efficacy and safety of adjuvant or new therapies for treating nerve damage in leprosy. Future trials should address non-clinical aspects, such as costs and impact on quality of life, which are highly relevant indicators for both policymakers and participants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacillus <I>Mycobacterium leprae</I>. Leprosy bacilli are probably spread through tiny droplets from the nose or mouth from infected and untreated individuals. The disease develops when the immune system fails to respond effectively to the antigens of the bacilli. The first sign of leprosy is often a patch on the skin, but damage to peripheral nerves may occur as well. Leprosy has various clinical forms, depending on the response of the immune system. Some people have only a few skin patches, and the number of bacilli is relatively small. This is classified as paucibacillary (PB) leprosy. Other people have many skin patches and a high number of bacilli in their body, which is classified as multibacillary (MB) leprosy (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Leprosy infection can be effectively treated with a combination of several antibiotics, in the form of multidrug therapy (MDT). Since the introduction of MDT, the number of people affected by leprosy has decreased substantially. In 2012, the prevalence was 0.34 per 10,000 (almost 182,000 cases on treatment) worldwide. The number of newly detected cases registered in 2012 was approximately 233,000. About 14,000 of these new cases presented with visible deformity (grade 2 disability). The recorded global rate of grade 2 disability among new cases of leprosy was 0.25 per 100,000 population in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>The body's immune response to the antigens of the leprosy bacilli may cause periods of inflammation in the skin and nerves, so-called reactions. Two types of reactions can occur: type 1 reaction, or reversal reaction, and type 2 reaction, or erythema nodosum leprosum. Reactions can occur before, during, and after multidrug therapy, and are the main cause of nerve damage and impairment in leprosy (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Nerve damage may develop slowly and often goes unnoticed until the condition is advanced. It is often the symptoms of a reaction that force people to seek help (<LINK REF="REF-Job-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Job 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholls-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Leprosy is, most importantly, a disabling disease. The World Health Organization estimates the number of people with disabilities due to leprosy at two to three million worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). People affected by leprosy, especially those with visible deformities and disabilities, fear discrimination and stigmatisation. These people can experience severe social and psychological problems (<LINK REF="REF-Heijnders-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijnders 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leekassa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leekassa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rafferty-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rafferty 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of nerve function</HEADING>
<P>Two tests are commonly used for testing sensory nerve function in people affected by leprosy. These tests work by pressing or touching prespecified points on the palms and soles with nylon filaments or with the tip of a ballpoint pen (<LINK REF="REF-Koelewijn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koelewijn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Brakel 2003</LINK>). The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test is a sensitive and repeatable method using standardised monofilaments to detect changes in sensory nerve function (<LINK REF="REF-Bell_x002d_Krotoski-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell-Krotoski 1990</LINK>). The ballpoint pen test is widely used and accepted in practice because it is simple, cheap, and available worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lienhardt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lienhardt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Brakel 2003</LINK>). One difficulty is to exert a standardised pressure with a ballpoint pen. When it is carefully used by trained staff, the ballpoint test can give moderate to good results (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koelewijn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koelewijn 2003</LINK>). Nerve damage can result in loss of muscle strength and function. Muscle strength is usually tested with the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) five-point scale (<LINK REF="REF-Brandsma-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandsma 1981</LINK>). Simpler three-or four-point scales also exist, which are mainly used in the field (<LINK REF="REF-Lienhardt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lienhardt 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids, especially prednisolone, are commonly used to treat severe reactions and nerve damage in leprosy, but convincing, high-quality evidence for their efficacy from any single study is lacking. Corticosteroids probably work by controlling acute inflammation and relieving the associated pain (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2000</LINK>). Common practice dictates that the earlier corticosteroids are given after onset of nerve damage, the more likely it is that permanent nerve function impairment will be prevented (<LINK REF="REF-Becx_x002d_Bleumink-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becx-Bleumink 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 1996</LINK>). The recommended corticosteroid regimen for treating nerve damage starts with 40 mg prednisolone daily and lasts for 12 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>). Studies indicate that prolonged prednisolone treatment may be more effective in treating severe reactions and nerve damage (<LINK REF="REF-Becx_x002d_Bleumink-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becx-Bleumink 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Little-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 2003</LINK>). Although it appears to be a very effective drug, prednisolone has some shortcomings. Long-term therapy can cause serious adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer, cataract, or psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Richardus-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardus 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugumaran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugumaran 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Also, a considerable proportion of people treated for nerve damage do not benefit from corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Croft-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Croft 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schreuder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreuder 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other therapies for improving nerve function and relieving nerve pain, such as surgical nerve decompression and azathioprine, have been tested (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebenezer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenezer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marlowe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marlowe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pannikar-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pannikar 1984</LINK>).

<P>Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice for acute severe reactions and nerve damage due to leprosy, but they have drawbacks. The long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids can be significant, the long-term beneficial effects are uncertain, and the optimal therapeutic regimen has not been established. Although this review focusses on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), only a few RCTs have been conducted in this area. We therefore considered the results in the light of non-randomised evidence in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.

<LI>Sensory nerve function measured with graded nylon filaments or a ballpoint pen, compared to baseline measurement. In general, we considered improvement as determined and defined by the original authors. We adapted the scores as defined by Van Brakel et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Brakel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Brakel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). For testing with graded nylon filaments, sensory NFI was diagnosed if the monofilament threshold was increased from normal by three or more points for any sensory nerve. Normal thresholds used were 200 mg for the hand and 2 g for the foot. If the score for any nerve decreased by three or more points from the baseline score, the nerve was considered as improved. When a non-graded test was used, such as the ballpoint pen test, a nerve was diagnosed as impaired if two or more test sites did not feel the stimulus. Improvement for any nerve was defined as two or more test sites feeling the stimulus, compared to the baseline measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Brakel 2003</LINK>).</LI>

<P>We used the Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager 5 (RevMan) for statistical data analysis (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). The study results were not suitable for pooling, meaning that we were not able to calculate a weighted treatment effect. We expressed results as a mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcome measures and as a risk ratio with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. We analysed participants with NFI of less than 6 months' duration and participants with longstanding impairment (6 to 24 months' duration) separately. We expressed adverse effects as the proportion of participants with adverse events. It was not possible to perform tests for heterogeneity or sensitivity analysis due to insufficient trials.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Improvement in sensory nerve function at one year</HEADING>
<P>Results at one year after the start of treatment were available for 41 participants in the prednisolone group and 34 participants in the placebo group. Improvement was measured as either a change score between baseline and end of follow-up or as the proportion of participants improved. Change in sensory score between 12 months from the start of treatment and registration was calculated. Sensory testing was done with five coloured, graded monofilaments (200 mg, 2 g, 4 g, 10 g, and 300 g). For the ulnar nerve, the 200 mg, 2 g, 4 g, and 300 g filaments were used. For the posterior tibial nerve, the 2 g, 4 g, 10 g, and 300 g filaments were used. Investigators tested six sites on the palm of the hand and four sites on the sole of the foot. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> shows the scoring method. Sensory improvement was defined as a reduction by three or more points from baseline to 12 months' follow-up. Mean difference (MD) between the baseline score and the score at 12 months' follow-up were compared for the two treatment groups. After 12 months, the mean change was -2.68 ± 2.66 in the prednisolone group and -3.00 ± 2.75 in the placebo group, both implying a mean improvement. The improvement was slightly greater in the placebo group, but the MD of 0.32 (95% CI -0.91 to 1.55) between the two groups was not significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The report also gave the proportion of people with sensory improvement after one year. In the prednisolone group, 33 out of 41 participants (80%) had sensory improvement compared with 27 out of 34 participants (79%) in the placebo group. The difference was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

Results of sensory nerve function at one year after the start of treatment were available for 40 participants in the prednisolone group and 49 participants in the placebo group. Of these 89 participants, 71 had sensory NFI only and 18 had had both sensory and motor NFI at randomisation. Improvement was measured as either a change score between baseline and end of follow-up or the presence of improvement.

Of these 21 participants, three had motor NFI only and 18 had both sensory and motor NFI. Improvement was measured as either a change score between baseline and end of follow-up or as the proportion of participants improved. Motor nerve function of the ulnar nerve was assessed with the modified MRC grading scale. The MRC scale was inverted for the purposes of this trial. A score of two or more points was considered as severe motor NFI. Change in motor score between 12 months from the start of treatment and registration was calculated. A negative change score was considered an improvement. After 12 months, the MD was -0.18 ± 0.98 in the prednisolone group and -0.30 ± 1.06 in the placebo group, both indicating a mean improvement. The improvement was slightly greater in the placebo group, but the MD of 0.12 (95% CI -0.76 to 1.00) between the two groups was not significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

<P>This trial evaluated none of the outcome measures prespecified for this review.</P>
<P>The primary endpoint was the requirement for additional corticosteroids during the 12-month trial period. A poor outcome was defined as a failure to respond to treatment in terms of changes to skin lesions, nerve pain or tenderness, or nerve function, or recurrences of skin or nerve lesions and needing extra corticosteroids. At the end of the 12-month period, 41 out of 90 participants (46%) in the short-regimen group (2940 mg over three months) needed extra corticosteroids. In the group receiving a low dose of prednisolone (2310 mg over five months), this was 28 out of 91 (31%); and 21 out of 88 participants (24%) following a high-dose prednisolone regimen (3500 mg over five months) required additional prednisolone. The difference between the high-dose and low-dose five-month regimen was not significant (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.26, n = 179) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The RR of needing additional corticosteroids was significantly less with the high-dose five-month course than with the three-month course (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.81, n = 178) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

<P>This trial evaluated clinical score, calculated as a summation of visual analogue scale score (pain), nerve pain score, graded sensory testing score, and voluntary muscle testing score after six months. People with type 1 (n = 12) reaction or type 2 reaction (n = 9) were randomly allocated to either a steroid regimen starting with 2 mg/kg/day (experimental group, n = 12) or a steroid regimen starting with 1 mg/kg/day (control group, n = 9). Both regimens were gradually tapered off during the six-month trial period if possible. Nerve pain (visual analogue scale), nerve palpation (grade 0 to 5), sensory nerve function (monofilaments), and motor nerve function (MRC scale) were measured and summarised in a clinical score. In addition, a neurophysiological evaluation (for example nerve conduction) was done. Results were reported at the end of the six-month trial period, comparing experimental and control group (type 1 and type 2 reactions) and type 1 versus type 2 reactions. All ulnar nerves showed improved clinical scores at the end of six months, but no significant differences were found, either between experimental and control group or type 1 and type 2 reactions. Improvement in neurophysiological parameters was significant during the first month of treatment in the experimental group, but this benefit had disappeared at the end of six months.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-21 09:46:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Corticosteroids are commonly used in the of management of acute nerve damage in leprosy, but the long-term effect and optimal regimen of corticosteroids remain uncertain. None of the trials found a significant difference in improvement in nerve function between treatment and control groups 12 months after the start of treatment. We did not explore earlier time points in our prespecified outcome measures. However, one small well-performed study of moderate quality and at low risk of bias reported a small difference in monofilament threshold perception at 4 months in patients with short-term (less than 6 months duration) disease, which was not sustained to later time points. None of the trials included quality of life measures or cost-effectiveness calculations.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:49:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Five RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. The interventions and outcomes were too heterogeneous to be entered in a meta-analysis. The numbers of participants included in the trials were small and did not allow for subgroup analysis. The variability between studies and the limitations in sample size made it difficult to draw any robust conclusions.</P>
<P>The occurrence of adverse effects was not significantly higher in the corticosteroid groups compared to the placebo groups. There was no statistically significant difference in adverse event rates between intravenous methylprednisolone with oral prednisolone and oral prednisolone alone. One meta-analysis, including 6602 participants, reviewed the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment compared to placebo treatment in randomised, double-blind, controlled trials. The review found that minor dermatologic adverse effects (for example moon face and acne), diabetes, hypertension, and psychosis were reported significantly more often in participants receiving steroids compared to participants in the placebo group. The occurrence of peptic ulcer did not differ significantly between groups and should not be considered a contraindication for corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Conn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conn 1994</LINK>). One study reported on the occurrence of adverse events in the three TRIPOD trials. The study found that the relative risk of acne, fungal infections, and gastric pain was increased in the corticosteroid group. Most of these events were reversible and did not require discontinuation of treatment or removal from the trials. No increased risk of major adverse events such as hypertension, diabetes, cataract, and psychosis was found in the corticosteroid group compared to the placebo group. With strict procedures and good surveillance, standardised corticosteroid therapy can be safely administered (<LINK REF="REF-Conn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conn 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richardus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardus-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardus 2003a</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-21 09:45:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Several non-randomised studies have examined the effect of corticosteroids for treating severe reactions and nerve damage in leprosy. The response to corticosteroid treatment seems to depend on the severity and duration of nerve function impairment (NFI) before the start of treatment. One study found that 35% of people with leprosy with complete anaesthesia and 67% with moderate sensory impairment improved to good function three months after the start of corticosteroid treatment. For people with complete motor paralysis or moderate motor impairment, 11% and 55%, respectively, recovered to good function (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Brakel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Brakel 1996</LINK>). The included RCT evaluating the treatment mild sensory impairment found that a significantly higher proportion of participants improved in the prednisolone group compared to the placebo group after four months, although the difference disappeared by the six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Brakel 2003</LINK>). Another study found that it may take a long time to achieve full recovery of chronic or recurrent NFI, much longer than the duration of a standard steroid course (<LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>). Recovery of nerve function loss seems to be more likely when the duration of NFI is less than six months (<LINK REF="REF-Becx_x002d_Bleumink-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becx-Bleumink 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Britton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1998</LINK>). To illustrate, data from Ethiopia showed that people with NFI for less than six months who were treated with steroids had full recovery in 50 out of 57 nerves (88%), while in people with recurrent or chronic NFI, only 20 out of 39 nerves (51%) had fully recovered after up to 10 years of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>). This is in line with the included RCT evaluating the treatment longstanding NFI, which found that 19 out of 41 nerves (46%) treated with prednisolone improved (<LINK REF="STD-Richardus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richardus 2003</LINK>). However, even in the placebo group, 25 out of 51 nerves (49%) showed spontaneous improvement after 12 months. Other studies have also reported spontaneous nerve function improvement in untreated individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Croft-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Croft 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schreuder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreuder 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>If one assumes some therapeutic effect of steroids (not shown in this review), the optimal corticosteroid regimen has not been established. Recommendations about the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy have changed over time (<LINK REF="REF-Naafs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1981</LINK>). The principles of a steroid therapy are to start with a dose that is sufficient to control the inflammation rapidly, then to taper off until the reaction has settled. The ideal would be a steroid course adjusted and tailored to the individual's situation, but this may only be possible in referral centres (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1991</LINK>). Currently, the World Health Organization recommends a standard 12-week course of prednisolone, which can be safely used in the field (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>). Other studies have suggested that a prolonged regimen might be more beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Little-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rose-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1991</LINK>). One small retrospective study compared a short-term steroid treatment (2 months) with a prolonged steroid treatment (3 to 18 months) for type 1 reaction in people with borderline leprosy. The study found that the longer treatment gave better results on improving motor nerve function than the two-month treatment and did not increase the risk of adverse events. The critical dose to control a reaction after the initial period was considered to be 15 mg to 20 mg daily (<LINK REF="REF-Naafs-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 1979</LINK>). One study examined the effects of prednisolone treatment on the cellularity and cytokine profiles of leprosy skin type 1 reactions. The results showed that prednisolone treatment decreased cytokine levels significantly only after 28 days from the start of treatment. Some people continued to have cytokine production for one to six months. This study illustrates the slow response to steroid therapy and continuing activity for several months (<LINK REF="REF-Little-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 2001</LINK>). While these non-randomised studies already suggested the benefits of a prolonged steroid course, the included RCT comparing three corticosteroid regimens confirms this in reporting that a longer duration of prednisolone treatment requires less additional steroids to control type 1 reactions than a short course of prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Rao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to other authorities, a substantial proportion of individuals treated for nerve damage do not respond to corticosteroids. The overall nerve function improvement levels vary between approximately 60% and 80% after steroid therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Croft-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Croft 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Croft-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Croft 2000</LINK> reported that 27 out of 83 treated nerves with motor impairment (33%) and 53 out of 166 treated nerves with sensory impairment (32%) did not improve or had deteriorated 12 months after the start of treatment. In a study in Thailand, 27 out of 77 people with leprosy who were treated with prednisolone (35%) showed no improvement or a worsening of NFI (<LINK REF="REF-Schreuder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreuder 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>One RCT examined the effect of prophylactic use of steroids in 636 people with newly diagnosed multibacillary leprosy (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>). This study showed that a low-dose prophylactic steroid regimen reduced the risk of NFI at the end of four months (RR 3.9, 95% CI 2.1 to 7.3), but the effect was not sustained at one year (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.8). Repeat use of steroid prophylaxis for a longer period than four months may sustain the benefit, but this needs to be examined further. A non-randomised follow-up study evaluated the effect of the combined use of steroids and multidrug therapy (MDT) in preventing nerve damage in participants with pure neural (PN) leprosy (n = 24) (<LINK REF="STD-Jardim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jardim 2007</LINK>). People with PN leprosy present with nerve damage or enlarged peripheral nerves but without having any sign of skin manifestation or skin patches. Participants received a paucibacillary MDT regimen for six months plus a daily morning dose of 1 mg/kg of prednisolone for one month followed by a progressive 10 mg monthly reduction over the remaining five months. Assessment of sensory nerve function, motor nerve function, and nerve pain was done with monofilaments, MRC scale, and visual analogue scale, respectively, at diagnosis and 12 months after the start of MDT. One out of 20 participants (5%) with initial sensory NFI and 5 out of 21 participants (24%) with initial motor NFI showed improvement 12 months after the start of MDT. Relief of neural pain was reported in four out of nine participants (44%). Nerve conduction parameters were also measured, and a significant reduction of nerve conduction block was found. The study authors indicate the need for a double-blind, placebo-controlled study for further evaluation of steroids as prophylactic drugs.</P>
<P>An alternative therapeutic approach for treating nerve damage in leprosy has been surgical decompression of acutely inflamed nerves. This approach is the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Veen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Veen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is an ongoing search for new therapies for nerve damage in leprosy because steroids are not always effective, can cause serious adverse effects, and because their long-term effect is unclear. One recent quasi-RCT compared an eight-week course of prednisolone combined with azathioprine with a 12-week course of prednisolone alone for treating severe type 1 reactions (<LINK REF="STD-Marlowe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marlowe 2004</LINK>). The trial did not find a significant difference between the two treatment groups in clinical severity scores, but the study was limited in size (n = 40) and unlikely to have been long enough for azathioprine to work. Therapies that are used for other immune-mediated conditions, such as ciclosporin or combinations of immunosuppressants, may be promising. It is plausible that these therapies could be effective for treating nerve damage in leprosy, but evidence from RCTs is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2000</LINK>). Two studies, one comparing ciclosporin with prednisolone and one compariing azathioprine with prednisolone, have been undertaken and will soon be published (<LINK REF="STD-Lambert-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lockwood-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lockwood 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>A non-randomised follow-up study assessed the effects of ciclosporin treatment in 33 Ethiopian and 10 Nepali people with severe type 1 leprosy reactions (<LINK REF="STD-Marlowe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Marlowe 2007</LINK>). Participants initially received ciclosporin 5 mg/kg together with 40 mg oral prednisolone for the first five days. Thereafter, participants received only ciclosporin for 12 weeks. This study used the clinical severity score as defined by Marlowe et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Marlowe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marlowe 2004</LINK>). The study found that among participants with acute NFI, 5 out of 16 (31%) had improved sensory scores and 9 out of 18 (50%) had improved voluntary muscle testing scores whilst on treatment. One participant maintained the sensory NFI, and five participants maintained motor NFI at 12 weeks after stopping ciclosporin. In participants with chronic NFI, 13 out of 21 (62%) had improved sensory scores, and 10 out of 20 (50%) had improved voluntary muscle testing scores. Six participants maintained the sensory nerve function improvement, and four participants maintained motor nerve function improvement at 12 weeks after stopping ciclosporin. Nerve pain and tenderness scores improved in 21 out of 41 participants (51%). The study reported jaundice (n = 1), raised serum creatinine levels (n = 2), loss of appetite (n = 1), indigestion, dizziness, and epigastric pain (n = 1), and hypertension (n = 3) as side effects of ciclosporin treatment. The trial authors suggest that ciclosporin monotherapy may be an effective treatment for severe type 1 reactions, with few adverse effects.</P>

<P>The mainstay for treating nerve damage in leprosy is corticosteroids. We did not find robust evidence to support the long-term effectiveness of corticosteroids in improving nerve function. The optimal corticosteroid regimen is unclear and unsupported by evidence from RCTs, but a five-month corticosteroid regimen appears to be more beneficial than a standard three-month corticosteroid regimen in terms of treatment response (need for additional corticosteroids). Standard corticosteroid regimens do not appear to be more harmful than placebo treatment based on the moderate-quality evidence included here, despite known adverse effects of corticosteroids.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:49:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Further research is needed to establish optimal corticosteroid regimens, in combination with other therapies, for long-term effectiveness and safety. Future trials should address non-clinical aspects, such as costs and impact on quality of life, which are highly relevant indicators for both policymakers and people with leprosy.</P>

<P>&#8220;Review question</P>
<P>Are corticosteroids an effective treatment for nerve damage in leprosy?&#8221;</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the reviewers appears to have switched from the review question above, to a series of variants, including:</P>
<P>a) Do corticosteroids show a post-treatment effect (several months after the withdrawal of treatment)?</P>
<P>b) Is any post-treatment effect (several months after the withdrawal of treatment) discernible after longstanding nerve damage is treated?</P>
<P>The authors&#8217; conclusions include the following statement:</P>
<P>&#8220;&#8230;moderate-quality evidence from two RCTs treating either longstanding or mild nerve function impairment did not show corticosteroids to have a superior effect to placebo on nerve function improvement.&#8221;</P>
<P>This statement appears to substitute the question a) above, in place of the Review question. It is an important error.</P>
<P>None of the evidence to date refutes the following hypotheses:</P>
<P>A. The sooner nerve damage is detected and treated, the greater the effect of corticosteroids.</P>
<P>B. The biological processes underlying nerve damage can persist after withdrawal of treatment, making it necessary to assess efficacy of treatment by nerve function improvement during treatment rather than 1 year later.</P>
<P>The review&#8217;s quoted failure to find the superiority of corticosteroids over placebo is explicable by the delay (up to 6 months or even more) until detection and treatment, and by the delay in measuring the efficacy of treatment (delayed for up to 1 year after withdrawal of treatment).</P>
<P>In short, variables other than the efficacy of corticosteroids sufficiently explain the review&#8217;s failure to reject the null hypothesis. Yet the review question is framed in terms of the efficacy of corticosteroids. This tends to mislead.</P>
<P>Currently, many workers try to protect patients against nerve damage by:</P>
<P>i) Detecting nerve damage as promptly as possible.</P>
<P>ii) Starting corticosteroid treatment as promptly as possible.</P>
<P>iii) Continuing or resuming corticosteroid treatment as required, to contain or reverse nerve damage.</P>
<P>The error described above tends to demotivate workers, skew policy-making in leprosy, and so adversely affect the well-being of patients.</P>
<P>It would be good if such errors were excluded from Cochrane reviews.</P>
<P>The authors deserve appreciation, however, for the robust conclusion that a five-month corticosteroid regimen appears to be more beneficial than a standard three-month corticosteroid regimen.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-08-30 15:15:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The authors of the review thank Dr Almeida for his comments about our Cochrane Systematic Review (CSR) of Corticosteroids for nerve damage in leprosy. He points out that the data in the review do not exactly reflect the title of the review itself. This is a result of the limited scope of the trials considered of high enough quality to be included in the review from the predefined selection criteria. There were only five heterogeneous trials of small size but of low risk of bias that could be included in this CSR. These only provide evidence to support two variants of the primary question that could be synthesised in the CSR. The evidence from these studies is only of low to moderate quality. However, in the areas where it is applicable it could be used to influence policy and practice within the limits of the evidence available. We hope we have made this clear in the review.</P>
<P>There is no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials to address the two hypotheses proposed by Dr Almeida, or for that matter any of the other potential questions that could be asked about the use of corticosteroids for nerve damage in leprosy. We did not consider a systematic review of the non-randomised literature as this is fraught with heterogeneities and bias that make the data uninterpretable in any statistically meaningful way. The absence of evidence in these areas is not an indication that corticosteroids do not work in these areas, and an absence of evidence should not be used to modify clinical policy and practice but to encourage the performance of appropriately powered, well designed studies which will answer the appropriate questions.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-11-21 09:47:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>A randomized controlled trial included by the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Brakel 2003</LINK>) compared corticosteroids - prednisolone - given for 4 months, with placebo. During these 4 months, outcome scores improved significantly more in the prednisolone group. None of the prednisolone group subjects showed a worsening in monofilament score. In the placebo group, worsening of sensory scores was recorded in 12%. The difference between groups, in scores at 4 months, attained statistical significance.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, the authors conclude that RCTs &#8220;did not show corticosteroids to have a superior effect to placebo on nerve function improvement.&#8221; This conclusion is thoroughly refuted by the evidence cited above.</P>
<P>It is surprising to find such a clearly refuted conclusion in a Cochrane Review.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-03-21 10:36:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>When this review was conceived and designed, it was felt that using a time period of a year was appropriate for assessment of an outcome in a disease which is chronic in the tempo of its presentation, has a prolonged duration of treatment, and the aim of that treatment is definitive &#8216;cure&#8217; of the leprosy. It is recognised that there may be residual end organ damage from the prolonged period of infection, treatment responses and treatment itself.</P>
<P>We are grateful to Dr Almeida for his comments. We appreciate that in <LINK REF="STD-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Brakel 2003</LINK> there was a short-term difference in the monofilament scores where the prednisolone group did not change and there was a 12% decline in the placebo-treated group which reached statistical significance. This difference did not persist until 12 months, where there was no difference.</P>
<P>We have not commented on this shorter-term difference for a number of reasons.</P>

<LI>It did not fit with the prespecified outcome times in the review; this may or may not be correct but the methodology for Cochrane reviews is very strict and post hoc modifications of the protocol introduce bias which we constantly try to avoid.</LI>
<LI>The difference did not persist and therefore is of questionable relevance. In a definitive treatment with not insignificant potential adverse effects, an unsustained benefit may not be clinically worthwhile.</LI>
<LI>A 12% change in a monofilament score may be statistically significant but is of questionable clinical significance and probably has no effect on disability/abilities.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Therefore, from one study there is a short-term and non-sustained difference which is difficult to report as it falls outside the remit of the review and is of unclear clinical utility.</P>
<P>We have suggested that the initial paragraph of the discussion in the <LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK> now reads:</P>
<P>&#8220;None of the trials found a significant difference in improvement in nerve function between treatment and control groups 12 months after the start of treatment. We did not explore earlier time points in our prespecified outcome measures. However, one small well performed study of moderate quality and at low risk of bias reported a small difference in monofilament threshold perception at 4 months in patients with short term (less than 6 months' duration) disease, which was not sustained to later time points.&#8221;</P>
<P>We thank Dr Almeida for his comments and will discuss whether to include a shorter term outcome for future versions of this review. We hope that there will be some more studies that we will be able to include in a later version to improve the evidence base in this important disease area.</P>

<P>'3. A 12% change in a monofilament score may be statistically significant but is of questionable clinical significance and probably has no effect on disability/abilities.' should read:</P>
<P>&#8216;3. A decline in 12% of patients on placebo versus 0% treated with prednisolone at 4 months assessed by their monofilament score may be statistically significant but is of questionable clinical significance and probably has no effect on disability/abilities in the context of the whole trial, the risks of bias and quality.&#8217;</P>
