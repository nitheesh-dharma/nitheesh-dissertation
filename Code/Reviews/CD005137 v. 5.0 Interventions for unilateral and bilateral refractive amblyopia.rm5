<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-15 16:05:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amblyopia (lazy eye) is a term describing reduced vision in one or both eyes. Amblyopia can sometimes be caused by a need for glasses. The need for glasses may be greater in one eye causing amblyopia only in the worse eye. This happens because the brain receives a weaker image from the eye with the greater need for glasses and prefers to use the eye with a clearer image. Sometimes there may be a strong need for glasses in both eyes causing amblyopia in both eyes. This is because the brain receives a blurred image from both eyes. </P>
<P>Children who have amblyopia due to a need for glasses in one eye only are often asked to wear a patch over the good eye, in addition to wearing their spectacles, to improve their vision. This review found that for some children with this type of amblyopia a period of glasses wear alone can restore normal vision. For those children for whom glasses wear alone does not improve vision there is evidence that wearing a patch can further improve vision. At present it is not possible to tell at the start of treatment which children will respond to glasses alone and which ones will need a patch as well. The amount of patching needed for an individual child cannot yet be predicted. This is because the effects of factors such as age are not fully understood. These findings are based on the results of eleven high-quality trials.</P>
<P>Children who have amblyopia in both eyes because of a need for glasses in both eyes are currently advised to wear their glasses as much of the time as possible in order to improve their vision. No trials looking at treatment for children who had reduced vision in both eyes were found.</P>

<P>In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone.

Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-02 12:06:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Amblyopia (lazy eye) can be defined as subnormal visual acuity, which is present with no demonstrable abnormality of the visual pathway and is not immediately resolved by wearing spectacles. Amblyopia occurs when the visual system is still developing and is vulnerable to poor-quality visual stimulation. Although it can affect both eyes it is invariably unilateral. During this time of development, formerly referred to as the critical period, amblyopia is usually a reversible condition.</P>
<P>Amblyopia is commonly classified according to the aetiology (cause):</P>
<UL>
<LI>strabismic (caused by squint);</LI>
<LI>stimulus deprivation (e.g. caused by cataract or ptosis); and</LI>
<LI>refractive (caused by optical or refractive error).</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is not uncommon for these types to co-exist.</P>
<P>This review deals with unilateral and bilateral amblyopia associated with refractive error. Interventions for the other types are being evaluated in a series of Cochrane reviews. See: <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a list of published Cochrane reviews on amblyopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Refractive error</HEADING>
<P>Refractive error is a mismatch in the length of the eye and its optical components. This may take the form of hypermetropia (long-sight), myopia (short-sight) or astigmatism (irregularly curved cornea). Hypermetropia occurs when the focal point of the eye's optical components is behind the retina and myopia occurs when the focal point is in front. Astigmatism prevents a sharp image from being formed at any point along the visual axis. In all cases, when refractive error is uncorrected, a blurred image falls on the retina (<LINK REF="REF-Elkington-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkington 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology of refractive amblyopia</HEADING>
<P>Refractive amblyopia can be subdivided into three different types (<LINK REF="REF-Ansons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansons 2001</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>ametropic amblyopia: a bilateral condition that occurs when there is a high degree of refractive error, and therefore blur, in both eyes;</LI>
<LI>meridional amblyopia: develops due to large amounts of astigmatism and may be either unilateral or bilateral;</LI>
<LI>anisometropic amblyopia: characterised by a difference in the refractive error between the two eyes (whether caused by hypermetropia, myopia or astigmatism), giving an unfocused image in one eye.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There is a lack of evidence regarding the magnitude of refractive error likely to lead to the development of amblyopia (<LINK REF="REF-Ansons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansons 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003b</LINK>). To be as inclusive as possible we used broad definitions of refractive error. For people with anisometropia and unilateral amblyopia we used a difference of 0.50 dioptres or greater of spherical (DS) or cylindrical (DC) error. For people with bilateral refractive amblyopia, we included any degree of refractive error.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Refractive error and refractive amblyopia</HEADING>
<P>A major review of the literature by <LINK REF="REF-Snowden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snowden 1997</LINK> found estimates of the prevalence of refractive error in general of between 1.3% and 5.6%. This variation is probably due to differences in the populations studied and various definitions used. The incidence of amblyopia in general is thought to be between 2% and 2.5% (<LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Microtropia</HEADING>
<P>Many patients with unilateral refractive amblyopia also have a small-angle squint known as microtropia. It has been suggested that the presence of a microtropia may limit the optimum acuity that can be achieved by amblyopia therapy to approximately one line less than the better eye (<LINK REF="REF-Mein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mein 1991</LINK>) because the amblyopic eye fixates eccentrically.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>A diagnosis of refractive amblyopia is made by carrying out a refraction (test for determining the required spectacle prescription to correct the optical error) and rechecking visual acuity wearing optimal correction using a vision test appropriate to the age of the child. Reduced acuity due to refractive error alone improves immediately once the correction (usually spectacles) is in place. Persistent acuity deficit despite best correction of refractive error and in the absence of any other possible cause of poor vision indicates the presence of amblyopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The aim of treatment is to restore the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye(s) to a normal level.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Refractive correction</HEADING>
<P>Improvement in amblyopia due to spectacle wear, or alternatively contact lens wear, alone has long been suspected and was documented for all types of amblyopia by <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2004</LINK> who termed it 'refractive adaptation.' It has since also been described as 'optical treatment' of amblyopia (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2006b</LINK>). A period of spectacle wear prior to any occlusion treatment is now widely accepted in the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia and is the only treatment available for bilateral refractive amblyopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Occlusion therapy</HEADING>
<P>In cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia, if amblyopia ceases to improve with refractive correction alone, any residual deficit may be treated with occlusion. In occlusion therapy, the vision of the better seeing eye is temporarily compromised in order to encourage the use of the amblyopic eye. This can be achieved in various ways. The most common being:</P>
<UL>
<LI>conventional occlusion: total deprivation of form vision and light (e.g. adhesive patching);</LI>
<LI>partial occlusion: deprivation of form vision only (e.g. Bangerter foils (thin opaque filters of varying density used to cover the spectacles lens));</LI>
<LI>optical penalisation: deprivation of form vision by using lenses to blur the visual acuity of the non-amblyopic eye;</LI>
<LI>pharmacological: deprivation of form vision by blurring the vision in the good eye with drops or ointment such as atropine sulphate.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Adjuncts to occlusion</HEADING>
<P>To enhance outcomes from occlusion therapy other interventions have been added to occlusion therapy, for example the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>CAM (Cambridge) vision stimulator: apparatus designed to treat amblyopia by intense visual stimulation with rotating black and white gratings for short periods of time (<LINK REF="REF-Banks-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banks 1978</LINK>). We believe that this apparatus is no longer commercially available.</LI>
<LI>Red filter treatment: a red filter is placed in front of the amblyopic eye during occlusion treatment in order to encourage use of the central fixation area of the eye (the fovea) (<LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 1996</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Pleoptics: in dense amblyopia, the central part of the retina (the fovea) may not be used for fixation. In order to disrupt this 'eccentric' fixation pleoptic treatment is used with apparatus such as the Euthyscope or the Projectoscope (<LINK REF="REF-Ansons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansons 2001</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We are not aware of these interventions being used in current clinical practice, but to be inclusive any trials using these interventions which met the inclusion criteria were eligible to be included in the review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The possibility of benefit from close work with occlusion was explored in a pilot randomised trial (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2005a</LINK>). A formal randomised controlled trial (RCT) has since been carried out and has been included within this review (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2008</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Factors affecting outcome</HEADING>
<P>Factors thought to affect treatment outcomes include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>compliance: it is recognised that compliance plays a significant role in the successful outcome of occlusion therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Newsham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newsham 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simons-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1999</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>age at commencement of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hardman-Lea-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardman Lea 1989</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>density of the amblyopia, the severity of the visual acuity deficit at presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Although the impact of living with untreated amblyopia has yet to be thoroughly evaluated, treatment for refractive amblyopia is common. The aim of treatment is to restore normal visual acuity and maximise binocular interaction. For over 200 years, the mainstay of therapy has been to prescribe any necessary spectacles and then, in unilateral amblyopia, to penalise vision in the sound eye.</P>
<P>The evidence for the role of spectacles in the treatment of refractive amblyopia and the impact of adding occlusion has not been systematically reviewed and summarised. Practice patterns, including prescribed occlusion regime and time allowed for optical treatment therefore vary widely (<LINK REF="REF-Mazow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a need to examine and summa rise the literature in order to establish the respective treatment effects of refractive correction alone and occlusion therapy and to attempt to identify an optimum treatment protocol.</P>

<P>We included trials with participants of any age, diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral refractive amblyopia. The criteria for diagnosis were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>reduced vision caused by refractive correction that does not immediately or fully correct to normal vision with refractive correction;</LI>
<LI>any amount or type of refractive error;</LI>
<LI>a difference in refractive correction between the two eyes of 0.50 DS/DC error or greater for unilateral refractive amblyopia;</LI>
<LI>initial corrected visual acuity in the amblyopic eye of worse than 6/9.5 (Snellen) or 0.200 (LogMAR) or equivalent measured on an age-appropriate test;</LI>
<LI>in cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia, corrected visual acuity in the non-amblyopic eye of 6/9.5 (Snellen) or 0.200 (LogMAR) or better measured on an age-appropriate test.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Participants with co-existing pathology that might reduce visual acuity (e.g. cataract) were not eligible. All participants had undergone cycloplegic refraction and had corrected visual acuity assessed using a test appropriate for age.</P>
<P>Since microtropia is commonly associated with unilateral refractive amblyopia we did not exclude participants with this type of manifest strabismus but planned to report the effect of associated microtropia on final visual acuity in a subgroup analysis. We are currently in correspondence with authors of included trials and hope to be able to present more data regarding microtropia in a future update of the review.</P>
<P>It has come to our attention that some trials may include participants who have had previous treatment. Where possible we will explore the effect of this in a subgroup analysis or if applicable describe by a narrative summary of the treatment outcomes. </P>
<P>It is likely that some period of refractive adaptation will be included in the trials prior to additional therapies being started.

<P>All of the trials included in the review reported the mean vision achieved by the intervention and control groups. We therefore calculated the mean difference in acuity between groups.

<P>Where the data were available to dichotomise outcomes into restoration of normal vision (0.200 or better) and residual acuity loss (worse than 0.200) we planned to calculate the risk difference (RD) in order to be able to present the number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). No trials published data to allow us to do this but we are in correspondence with trial authors and if possible this will be included in an update of the review.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Agervi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Agervi 2009</LINK>: this trial included 80 participants with an age range of 4.0 years to 5.4 years diagnosed with untreated unilateral refractive amblyopia. Uncorrected visual acuity of the amblyopic eye ranged from 0.300 to 1.300 LogMAR assessed using a Lea Symbols vision chart. Anisometropia was defined as intraocular spherical refractive error difference of 1.0 DS or more. Refractive correction alone was compared to refractive correction plus Bangerter filters (partial occlusion). Glasses were prescribed on the first visit for full-time wear although participants were instructed not to wear the glasses until the day of baseline examination. All treatments began simultaneously without a period for refractive adaptation. Participants randomised into the Bangerter filter treatment group were prescribed a filter of density 0.3 which was attached to the back of the glasses of the non-amblyopic eye and worn full-time. The Bangerter filter was removed when vision in the amblyopic eye was equal to that of the non-amblyopic eye.</P>
<P>Thirty-three participants for each treatment group were included for the final analysis. Mean visual acuity of the amblyopic eye for the spectacles only group changed from 0.4 (range 0.3 to 0.9) to 0.1 (range -0.1 to 0.2). Amblyopia resolved in an average of 3.9 months (± 3.2 months) in 31 (94%) participants of the glasses only group. Thirty-one participants (94%) also achieved resolution of amblyopia in the Bangerter filter treatment group. Amblyopia resolved within 2.2 months (± 1.9 months). No reoccurrence of amblyopia was reported in the trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2008</LINK>: this trial included 61 participants of varying age groups; younger children (three to seven years of age), older children (eight to 18 years of age) and adult patients (older than 18 years of age). All participants were diagnosed with unilateral refractive amblyopia ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 as assessed on an age-appropriate LogMAR based test. Full-time glasses wear was specified for three months prior to treatment commencing. Anisometropia was defined as <U>&gt;</U> 1 DS. Participants were randomised to receive either conventional patching therapy as per the Paediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) studies (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003b</LINK>) or perceptual learning. Perceptual learning participants underwent a training session three times per week with an average of 30 minutes per session. The average number of training sessions was 48 (29.5 hours). Participants with mild or moderate amblyopia (0.100 to 0.600) were prescribed two hours daily occlusion and those with severe amblyopia (0.700 to 1.300) were prescribed six hours daily occlusion. The mean treatment duration for participants receiving occlusion was 37.3 weeks (522.2 hours).</P>
<P>The mean visual acuity of the amblyopic eye improved by 0.34 LogMAR (95% CI 0.22 to 0.47 LogMAR) with occlusion and 0.25 LogMAR (95% CI 0.16 to 0.35) with perceptual learning. Resolution of amblyopia was achieved in 10 out 26 patients (38%) in the perceptual learning group and 17 of 27 patients (63%) in the occlusion group. Resolution of amblyopia was defined as 0.100 LogMAR in this trial.</P>
<P>We contacted the authors to try to obtain data on the participants who met the criteria of this review for both improvement in visual acuity and for those in which amblyopia was resolved. Unfortunately we have received no reply. This means there are insufficient data reported in the paper to include this trial in the review and we have therefore performed no 'Risk of bias' assessment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2003</LINK>: this trial included 177 participants aged between three and five years recruited from eight centres in the UK, who had been identified in a preschool vision screening programme in England. Of the 177 participants in the study, 173 had significant refractive error in one or both eyes, 127 of which were considered by the authors to be anisometropic. Six participants were thought to have microtropia. No participants were diagnosed with bilateral refractive amblyopia. Data were analysed in two groups by start visual acuity: mild (0.200 (6/9) to 0.300 (6/12)) and moderate (worse than 0.300 (6/12)). We extracted data for participants meeting the review definition of amblyopia (n = 119). We contacted the authors but data are no longer available to allow separate analysis of patients with unilateral refractive error meeting the review definition of anisometropia. No data were available to allow subgroup analysis of participants with microtropia.</P>
<P>At entry into the study, participants were randomised into one of three groups: no treatment (n = 59), spectacles only (n = 59) or full treatment (spectacles and occlusion) (n = 59) and then refracted. There was an initial six-week spectacles only (refractive adaptation) phase for the patients in the full treatment group.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure was best corrected visual acuity on a crowded LogMAR test at 12 months, reported as mean acuity for each group. Participants in the full treatment group were started on occlusion after six weeks of spectacles wear if visual acuity was still reduced. Regimes of occlusion were not standardised. Participants in the spectacles only group received spectacles only for 52 weeks and participants in the no treatment group received no active treatment for 52 weeks. There was then a further six months of follow-up during which time all groups were eligible for full treatment as indicated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nyman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nyman 1983</LINK>: this trial compared adding CAM stimulation by black and white gratings to occlusion therapy alone. Fifty participants aged between four and 6½ years with all types of amblyopia were recruited at paediatric care centres in Stockholm. Amblyopia was defined as a difference in distance visual acuity of more than two lines between the two eyes, provided the vision in the worse seeing eye was not better than 6/12 after eight weeks of full-time spectacles wear. A Snellen E chart with decimal steps was used to assess vision. Spectacles were prescribed and worn for eight weeks, after which participants were randomly assigned to receive CAM vision therapy or occlusion alone. Participants in the occlusion group were prescribed either partial (Bangerter filters) or total occlusion.</P>
<P>Treatment with CAM therapy lasted approximately seven minutes and the number of treatments given varied from five to 10.</P>
<P>It was not possible either to separate the data for those participants diagnosed with unilateral refractive amblyopia or to extract the data needed from the published paper. We contacted the authors but unfortunately the data were no longer available. Since no relevant data were available it was not possible to assess this study for risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Paediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group</HEADING>
<P>The Paediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) is a collaboration of clinical sites based in the USA. The group has carried out a series of studies of treatment for amblyopia, four of which meet the inclusion criteria for this review. All the PEDIG studies use an electronic visual acuity tester with a standardised testing protocol and report outcomes as mean visual acuity. In addition to any prescribed occlusion, participants in all the included PEDIG studies were required to carry out an hour of close work. In the PEDIG studies, vision at baseline is classified into either moderate amblyopia (0.300 to 0.600 LogMAR) or severe amblyopia (0.700 to 1.300 LogMAR). None of the PEDIG studies had data that allowed us to assess the effect of microtropia on the reported outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003a</LINK>: this trial examined the impact of prescribing two hours daily conventional occlusion compared to prescribing six hours daily conventional occlusion for 189 children under seven years of age with moderate amblyopia. We contacted the authors and they provided data for the 62/189 who had unilateral refractive amblyopia; 34 in the two-hour group and 28 in the six-hour group. No trial participant was diagnosed with bilateral refractive amblyopia. The main outcome measure was visual acuity in the amblyopic eye after four months of treatment.</P>
<P>Participants wore spectacles full-time for four weeks prior to beginning occlusion therapy. Compliance with treatment was assessed by means of a parental diary.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003b</LINK>: all 175 participants in this study had severe amblyopia and were under seven years of age. The trial lasted for four months. The main outcome measure for this trial was vision in the amblyopic eye after four months of treatment.</P>
<P>Participants underwent cycloplegic refraction and were instructed to wear spectacles for four weeks prior to starting occlusion. Participants were randomised to receive either six hours daily occlusion (n = 29) or full-time daily occlusion (n = 28).</P>
<P>All types of amblyopia were included. The authors were contacted and provided data for the participants diagnosed with unilateral refractive amblyopia (n = 57). No participants were diagnosed with bilateral refractive amblyopia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2005b</LINK>: this trial included 507 participants aged seven to 17 years with all types of amblyopia ranging from 0.300 to 1.300 LogMAR some of whom had had previous treatment for amblyopia.</P>
<P>Those who had not received previous treatment were provided with spectacles and instructed not to wear them prior to the baseline assessment. Participants were randomised into either an optical correction group who only received spectacles or a treatment group who were prescribed two to six hours of occlusion. Participants under the age of 13 years in the treatment group also had atropine sulphate and were therefore excluded from this review. We contacted the authors and they provided data for those participants (n = 103) who met the inclusion criteria for the review. No participants with bilateral refractive amblyopia were enrolled in the trial.</P>
<P>Visual acuity was assessed every six weeks for 24 weeks; the primary outcome measure was vision at the visit where maximum acuity was recorded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2006a</LINK>: this trial was designed to assess whether a treatment effect could be identified from adding occlusion to spectacles in the treatment of moderate and severe amblyopia rather than to elicit the maximum potential benefit from occlusion. All participants were under seven years of age. Eighty-two of 180 people met the inclusion criteria for this review (additional data provided by authors). No participants were diagnosed with bilateral refractive amblyopia.</P>
<P>Participants who required refractive correction entered a spectacle run-in phase prior to treatment; optimal refractive correction was prescribed and worn full-time until vision in the amblyopic eye stabilised. They were then randomised to two hours of daily occlusion with spectacles or to a spectacles only treatment group.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was best corrected vision in the amblyopic eye after five weeks of treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2008</LINK>: this trial included 425 children aged between three and seven years diagnosed with strabismic, anisometropic or mixed amblyopia ranging from 0.300 to 1.300 LogMAR. Glasses were prescribed for a minimum of 16 weeks before the participants were randomised to received either two hours daily occlusion with near activities or two hours daily occlusion with distance activities.</P>
<P>Visual acuity was assessed at two, five, eight and 17 weeks. The main outcome visit was at eight weeks, meaning some participants may have further improvement to their vision.</P>
<P>No participants were diagnosed with bilateral refractive amblyopia as defined in this review and the trial organiser provided data on the 215 patients diagnosed with unilateral refractive amblyopia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007a</LINK>: this trial examined the dose/response of occlusion for amblyopia by measuring the actual dose of occlusion received by the patient. The primary outcome measures were concordance with occlusion and change in visual acuity, proportion of acuity deficit corrected and final visual acuity on a LogMAR letter recognition test.</P>
<P>The visual acuity inclusion criterion for this trial was "significant intraocular difference of 0.100 log units". Ninety-seven participants, aged between three and eight years at entry, were included in the study. Of these, 34 were classified as anisometropic. We contacted the authors and they provided data for the 24/34 (71%) of these who met the review definition of amblyopia. Data were not available to allow us to comment on the numbers with microtropia. No participants with bilateral refractive amblyopia were included in this trial.</P>
<P>Participants wore optimal refractive correction for 18 weeks and were then randomised to being prescribed either six or 12 hours occlusion daily.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Tytla-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Tytla 1981</LINK>: this study included 15 participants with all levels and types of amblyopia aged between five and 12 years. Corrected starting visual acuity ranged from 6/18 to 6/60 Snellen in the amblyopic eye. Participants were randomised to receive CAM vision stimulation or stimulation with homogeneous grey discs. The trial lasted for four weeks, with vision being assessed before, during and after each weekly session. Three participants met the review inclusion criteria, however, data were only available for two of them. It was not possible to utilise these data in any of the comparisons and therefore we did not assess this trial for quality and the 'Risk of bias' table for it is empty.</P>

Reported outcomes therefore do not necessarily reflect optimum treatment effect but a comparison of treatment effectiveness at a given point in time. It is also possible that for some participants vision regressed after treatment stopped.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-07 12:13:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of treatment for unilateral refractive amblyopia has grown substantially over recent years, however treatment for bilateral refractive amblyopia has not been subjected to the same intensity. For unilateral amblyopia the respective roles of treatment by refractive correction and treatment by conventional occlusion have become more clearly defined, and some progress has been made towards clarifying the effect of differing amounts of occlusion. Comparing outcomes from treatment for the various studies included in this review was difficult due to variation in treatment protocols, outcome reporting and post-treatment follow-up. However, data from the high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in this review inform some of the fundamental questions regarding the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The natural history of untreated unilateral and bilateral refractive amblyopia</HEADING>
<P>There are few studies documenting the natural history of unilateral refractive amblyopia. The best available data are contained within the study by <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2003</LINK> who randomised patients to a 'no treatment' control group for 12 months. After 12 months, although vision in the control group had not deteriorated, mean acuity was statistically significantly poorer in the control group when compared to the full treatment (spectacles and occlusion) group. When treated at the end of the 12 months, 44% of the entire control group (at a mean age of five years) required spectacles alone, 44% went on to need occlusion and the remainder required no treatment at all. The improvement in the children who needed no treatment may indicate that amblyopia resolved spontaneously over the 12 months but the improvement is more likely to be explained by increased maturity and therefore improved ability to co-operate with testing. It is also possible that the visual deficit was not in fact amblyopia but purely an uncorrected refractive error that resolved spontaneously over the 12 months. Taken together these data suggest that for the majority of patients (88%), intervention (spectacles +/- occlusion) is required to resolve unilateral refractive amblyopia but, equally as important, some children may spontaneously improve, which was not previously believed to be the case.</P>
<P>The best available evidence for the natural history of bilateral refractive amblyopia comes from case reports from patients who have failed to comply with treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Simons-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1999</LINK> showed via a case series of 18 patients a very poor response in terms of improvement to visual acuity where spectacle treatment had not been tolerated over a period of one year. However, it should be noted that only one patient in this series was diagnosed with bilateral refractive amblyopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Optimum treatment protocol for unilateral refractive amblyopia</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Refractive adaptation/optical treatment of amblyopia</HEADING>
<P>Included studies utilised a variety of approaches to refractive or optical treatment so it is possible that, in some cases, occlusion was started before maximum benefit from optical treatment alone had been achieved. The lack of standardisation of this phase of treatment means we are unable to draw firm conclusions from our data regarding the optimum duration of spectacles wear prior to occlusion therapy. However, a period of spectacle wear alone is now well recognised as the initial stage in the treatment of refractive amblyopia (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2004</LINK>). A pragmatic approach, adopted in more recent Paediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) studies, is to monitor acuity until there is no significant improvement for at least two consecutive visits.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The impact of occlusion on visual outcomes</HEADING>
<P>One of the objectives of the review was to identify the impact of adding occlusion therapy to spectacles in the management of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Isolating and comparing the treatment effect from occlusion across the included studies was complicated by the varying periods allowed for optical treatment and other differences such as including an hour of close work. The role of close work whilst undertaking occlusion has also be examined as part of this review. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2008</LINK> found no statistical difference in adding close work to occlusion.</P>
<P>Data regarding the treatment effect of spectacles alone versus spectacles plus total occlusion needs to be interpreted in the light of some important considerations. The data from two of the three studies included for this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2006a</LINK>) were extracted from a larger study population including other types of amblyopia. Using extracted data, with fewer participants, resulted in reduced statistical power and therefore a reduced likelihood of finding a difference even if there was one. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2003</LINK> found a trend towards a significant treatment effect from adding occlusion therapy to glasses wear. Further work is needed to clarify the magnitude of the added treatment benefit from occlusion.</P>
<P>The role of partial occlusion was examined in one trial. <LINK REF="STD-Agervi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Agervi 2009</LINK> randomised participants to receive glasses alone versus glasses and Bangerter filter treatment. However, both treatments were started simultaneously without any allowance for refractive adaptation. No statistical significance was found in terms of final mean vision achieved between the two treatment groups, but in the intervention group time to resolution of the amblyopia was almost twice as fast: 2.2 months compared to 3.9 months. The outcomes from this study could indicate that all occlusion adds is speed; maybe other studies just have not been giving optical treatment enough time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Occlusion dose/response</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003b</LINK> did not find a difference between prescribing two versus six hours or between prescribing six hours versus full-time occlusion. This could be taken as evidence that no dose/response relationship exits in occlusion therapy. The investigators, however, postulate that one explanation for this might be the fact that actual amounts of occlusion achieved were different to that prescribed. Another proposed explanation is that the rate of response to treatment is limited at an anatomical level and that there is therefore a maximum rate of recovery.</P>
<P>Recent trials have added to the evidence for a dose/response relationship in the treatment of amblyopia. <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007a</LINK> randomised children to receive either six hours or 12 hours of occlusion per day and found very similar visual outcomes between the two groups. Data from the occlusion dose monitor, however, confirmed that the amount of occlusion actually achieved was also similar in both groups: 4.2 hours in the six-hour group compared to 6.2 in the 12-hour group.</P>
<P>Taking into account the dose actually received the study data suggest that dose rates of between three and six hours per day are associated with optimum improvement. The effect of age, density of amblyopia and other factors on the rate of improvement and final outcome are not yet fully understood. The authors recommend that in the interim &#8220;achieving an initial dose rate of three to four hours/day should be a clinical priority&#8221;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Concordance with occlusion</HEADING>
<P>In order for any treatment to succeed it has to be acceptable to the patient and, in the case of amblyopia, also to the parents or other principal caregivers. Attempts to describe and quantify psycho-social effects of treatment are increasing, for example the use of the Amblyopia Treatment Index in the PEDIG studies. Three studies included in this review attempted to measure concordance (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007a</LINK>) and all reported considerable variation in compliance: prescribing higher doses of occlusion was associated with more variation in compliance. A recent RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Loudon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loudon 2006</LINK>) was designed to investigate predictors of non-concordance with occlusion therapy. Results from the study showed that education aimed primarily at the child significantly improved compliance and reduced the number of children who would not wear the occlusion at all. The authors identified low vision at the start of treatment to be the most significant clinical predictor of poor concordance. In addition the study findings suggest that poor understanding of the treatment and its purpose due to language and cultural/educational barriers are associated with reduced concordance. The inter-play between these factors and the psycho-social aspects of occlusion therapy warrant further investigation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">When to treat?</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2005b</LINK> demonstrated some response to occlusion therapy in children who were 13 to 17 years of age. However, all of these older participants demonstrated a residual visual deficit. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2003</LINK> treatment was delayed for 12 months in the control group, giving a mean age of five years (as opposed to four years) at commencement of treatment. There was no evidence of harm from delaying treatment commencement until approximately five years of age. As a small proportion of patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2003</LINK> study showed spontaneous improvement over the 12 months without treatment, it could be argued that such a delay may mean some patients avoid unnecessary treatment. It should be noted though that evidence from the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007a</LINK> suggests that younger children with amblyopia (under four years of age) require lower doses of occlusion. Additional, comparable studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings.</P>

The two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nyman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nyman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tytla-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Tytla 1981</LINK>) did not detect any benefit from adding CAM stimulation to occlusion therapy.</P>
<P>The role of other adjuncts such as prescribed periods of close work remain controversial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The results reported in this review need to be considered in the light of some limitations. We extracted data for participants with unilateral refractive amblyopia from trials powered for a larger sample, e.g. including other types of amblyopia or 0.200 or better entry acuity. Using smaller numbers in our analyses may explain why some comparisons failed to reach statistical significance. Only one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007a</LINK>) had a design that specifically addressed one of the objectives of the review: the dose/response from conventional occlusion. Eliciting the impact of adding occlusion alone may have been confounded by the addition of a period of close work in the PEDIG studies and the lack of a standard approach to allow vision to stabilise in spectacles across the included studies. In addition some of the included trials had been designed to investigate whether a treatment effect could be elicited rather than to establish maximum benefit from treatment and therefore reported outcomes included data on participants who were still undergoing occlusion. It may be that in these studies optimum acuity had not yet been achieved. It is also important to note that none of the studies included a post-treatment follow-up period, precluding assessment of sustainability of treatment effects.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure for all the included trials was mean visual acuity and it is possible that this may have masked both failure to improve and magnitude of improvement. In updates of the review we are therefore hoping to be able to present the number needed to treat to benefit (NNT).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Optimum treatment protocol for bilateral refractive amblyopia</HEADING>
<P>Bilateral refractive amblyopia, by its very nature, is caused by a high degree of bilateral refractive error. The aim of treatment is restoration of visual acuity in one or both eyes. Current treatment revolves around correction of the refractive error by either glasses or contact lenses and time. A gradual improvement in vision over time is expected. <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2007</LINK> identified 113 participants with previously untreated bilateral refractive amblyopia. Mean binocular acuity improved 3.9 lines over a one-year period. The cumulative probability of binocular acuity of 0.100 or better after one year of glasses wear was 74%. No randomised trials comparing differing treatment options for bilateral refractive amblyopia where available for analysis.</P>

<UL>
<LI>For some patients with unilateral refractive amblyopia, refractive correction alone may resolve the visual deficit. At present it is not possible to determine at the start of treatment which children will fall into this category.</LI>
<LI>A pragmatic approach to treatment may be to allow time for improvement in vision with refractive correction alone and then prescribe occlusion for any persistent amblyopia. This approach should minimise occlusion treatment.</LI>
<LI>Concordance with prescribed dose of occlusion varies in an unpredictable fashion and it appears that higher doses are associated with greater variation in concordance.</LI>
<LI>Current evidence suggests that the majority of children with amblyopia will benefit from three to six hours of occlusion per day. Children under the age of four may require less occlusion but the effect of age on the dose/response relationship is not yet fully understood.</LI>
<LI>Current evidence does not suggest any benefit can be gained by the addition of close work with prescribed occlusion.</LI>
</UL>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-07 12:15:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the high-quality studies included in this review enable a more evidence-based approach to amblyopia treatment, there is still a significant need for further research. Specific areas that require further study are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>identification of factors associated with successful treatment by optical correction alone;</LI>
<LI>determining the degree of anisometropia likely to cause amblyopia;</LI>
<LI>determining the magnitude of visual gain from occlusion therapy;</LI>
<LI>clarification of the effect of:</LI>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>age at treatment commencement;</LI>
<LI>duration of acuity deficit;</LI>
<LI>type and degree of refractive error;</LI>
<LI>magnitude of visual loss.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Regarding the overall outcome of therapy and the dose/response relationship the following issues require clarification:</P>
<UL>
<LI>investigating effectiveness of adjuncts to occlusion therapy such as optical penalisation;</LI>
<LI>sustainability of treatment effect and rate of recurrence of amblyopia after cessation of treatment including factors associated with/preventing recurrence;</LI>
<LI>establishing overall impact of treatment:</LI>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>effect on psycho-social and emotional well-being of the child;</LI>
<LI>non-concordance with therapy - causes, effects, measures to reduce;</LI>
<LI>cost-effectiveness of treatment;</LI>
<LI>consequences of not treating.</LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Investigating the role of other modes of occlusion/optical penalisation. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Difficulties in planning and conducting trials in this area include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the need for an agreed definition of amblyopia, including reference to published normative data on commonly used children's vision tests;</LI>
<LI>measurement of compliance with prescribed treatment in the absence of a commercially viable occlusion dose monitor;</LI>
<LI>the need for multicentre co-operation in order to recruit sufficient numbers;</LI>
<LI>logistical and funding constraints on obtaining long-term follow-up data.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We are aware that high-quality trials addressing some of these questions are underway and any that meet the inclusion criteria will be reported in updates of the review.</P>
