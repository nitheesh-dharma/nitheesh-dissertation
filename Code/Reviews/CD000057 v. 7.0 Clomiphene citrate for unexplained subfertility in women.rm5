<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:01:11 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clomiphene citrate is a fertility drug that can increase the number of eggs released for possible fertilisation. It is used by women who do not ovulate regularly and by some who do but still have not become pregnant. Clomiphene citrate does not appear to increase the chance of pregnancy in women who ovulate regularly but have failed to conceive after more than a year of unprotected intercourse and so are considered to be subfertile. An associated risk of treatment with clomiphene citrate is a 10% chance of multiple pregnancy. The results of this review of trials should be used with caution due to the heterogeneity between some of the studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-24 13:53:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of clomiphene citrate has been demonstrated in the treatment of subfertility associated with infrequent or irregular ovulation. The physiologic effects and clinical benefits in ovulatory women with unexplained subfertility are less clear. The drug is associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy and a suggestion of potentially increased ovarian cancer risks. In light of these concerns, defining the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate for ovulatory women with unexplained subfertility is extremely important.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-06 14:09:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:06:11 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovulatory dysfunction is one of the primary causes of reproductive failure in subfertile couples. Women with ovulatory dysfunction do not ovulate regularly or do ovulate but fail to become pregnant. Some women ovulate regularly but fail to conceive after more than a year of unprotected intercourse and so are considered to be subfertile.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:07:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clomiphene citrate is a drug used for women with ovulatory dysfunction, such as luteal phase deficiency and anovulation where there is no ovulatory cycle, or oligo-ovulation where there are irregular or infrequent ovulatory cycles. Clomiphene citrate usually comes as a 50 mg tablet taken orally on the fifth through to the ninth day of the cycle.<BR/>
<BR/>Clomiphene citrate is generally well tolerated. Side effects associated with its use include hot flashes, mood swings, headaches and visual disturbances. Many of the side effects are transitory and typically abate after the cessation of treatment. The quality and quantity of cervical mucus production in clomiphene citrate treatment cycles may sometimes be reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Maxson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxson 1984</LINK>) but rarely to an extent that would affect the capture, transport or survival of sperm.<BR/>A variety of publications have raised the question of increased ovarian cancer risks associated with clomiphene use (<LINK REF="REF-Rossing-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossing 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittemore-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittemore 1992</LINK>). The more rigorous of these studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rossing-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossing 1994</LINK>) suggests that in women taking clomiphene for more than 12 cycles the incidence of invasive epithelial cancer increases approximately three-fold. However, it remains unclear whether this association is causal or secondary to an inherent increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with the disease processes leading to subfertility.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:10:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of subfertility associated with oligo-ovulation has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1996</LINK>). It has been shown to increase the number of follicles produced per cycle and, therefore, increases the potential number of eggs available for fertilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 1991</LINK>). Clomiphene appears to act as an estrogen receptor blocker and leads to elevation of endogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) production, which in turn stimulates multiple follicular development. As a result, the multiple pregnancy rate is elevated to approximately 8% to 10%. Clomiphene citrate is cleared through the liver and excreted in the stools.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-06 14:09:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In oligo-ovulatory women clomiphene citrate increases the likelihood of ovulation approximately 10 fold and pregnancy approximately six-fold (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1996</LINK>). However, in the absence of a clear indication such as oligo-ovulation, the use of clomiphene may be considered somewhat controversial. Despite this, clomiphene is widely prescribed in ovulatory women with unexplained infertility. Understanding the effectiveness of clomiphene in this patient group is, therefore, extremely important.</P>

<P>Studies were conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>), UK and Ireland (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazener-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazener 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>) and Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Melis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1987</LINK>). The duration of treatment in the included studies was reported as three months (<LINK REF="STD-Glazener-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazener 1990</LINK>), four cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>) and six months or cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK> reported on pregnancy per cycle.</P>
<P>The mean female age ranged from 29.3 to 33 (SD 4.4) years with a reported range of 20 to 41 years. The mean duration of infertility ranged from 3.5 (SD 1.7) to 5.4 years (range 2 to 15 years). All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>) included women with primary and secondary infertility; Fisch et al included only primary infertility. The number of cycles in the studies ranged from four to six.</P>
<P>There was clinical heterogeneity between studies in terms of the population included. Surgically treated endometriosis was present in approximately 40% of women in <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>. The distribution of such participants between groups after randomisation was not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK> included only participants with primary infertility. Although that study focused on this specific group it was the most rigorously designed of all the studies included and used a parallel design with central randomisation.</P>
<P>The dose ranges of clomiphene and the times of administration were similar between studies. Three studies administered 50 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>) and four administered 100 mg for four days (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazener-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazener 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clomiphene was administered on days two to six of the menstrual cycle in the studies reported by <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Glazener-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazener 1990</LINK> and on days five to nine in four other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1987</LINK>); if the menstrual cycle was less than 27 days clomiphene was administered on days four to eight of the cycle by Deaton 1990. Harrison (1983) reported administering clomiphene for four days but gave no details of which days these were (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was some discrepancy in the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), an agent for triggering ovulation. In one study, the treatment group but not the control group received hCG (<LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>). The dose of hCG varied from 5000 U (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>) to 10,000 U (<LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>). No details were provided in three trial reports (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazener-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazener 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main outcomes reported were pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage and multiple pregnancies. These are described further in the 'Effects of Interventions' section of this review. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was not reported by any author.</P>

<P>Live birth was reported by four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>) however the data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK> could not be separated for the arm before crossover took place; therefore, the data could not be extracted for analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK> reported on live birth: 26/192 women in the clomiphene group and 32/193 women in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.38; P = 0.41) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Live birth was also described as an outcome by <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK> but details as to which group the women had been allocated to were not available in the paper.</P>
<P>
<B>Pregnancy</B>
</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>) reported a statistically significant improvement in pregnancy rate over placebo following clomiphene (P &lt; 0.05) but this difference was based on the absence of pregnancy in the placebo group of 36 patients during the four cycles of observation. In the six months that followed, seven pregnancies occurred in this group. These data have been taken into account in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The ORs for clinical pregnancy per patient were 2.40 (95% CI 0.70 to 8.19; P = 0.16) for clomiphene citrate with IUI; 1.03 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; P = 0.91) without IUI; and 1.66 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.80; P = 0.35) without IUI but with hCG. It should be noted that the heterogeneity between studies ranged from 34% to 58% measured using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Miscarriage </B>
</P>
<P>Miscarriage was reported in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>). The data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK> were not separable before crossover and therefore could not be extracted for analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK> did not report a significant difference in miscarriage rate between the treatment and control groups (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.61; P = 0.41) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Multiple pregnancy</B>
<BR/>The crude rate of twin pregnancy was reported by only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>). It was not clear whether one of these pregnancies was conceived after clomiphene or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>). Multiple births and ectopic pregnancies were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK> but data could not be separated from the first and second arms of the crossover and could not, therefore, be included in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK> reported on the incidence of multiple pregnancies and no significant differences were identified between treatment and placebo groups (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.19; P = 1.0).</P>
<P>
<B>Ectopic pregnancy</B>

<B>Adverse effects</B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK> was the only paper to report on adverse effects (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). There were significant differences between clomiphene and expectant management for abdominal pain (OR 9.89, 95% CI 3.81 to 25.69; P &lt; 0.00001); nausea (OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.07 to 18.10; P = 0.001); headache (OR 6.47, 95% CI 2.64 to 15.83; P &lt; 0.0001); hot flushes (OR 8.75, 95% CI 3.02 to 25.36; P &lt; 0.0001) and bloating (OR 81.28, 95% CI 4.94 to 1337.02; P = 0.002).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-10-06 14:15:13 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In counselling women regarding the effectiveness of clomiphene, the data presented here suggest no evidence of treatment benefit on pregnancy rate. Realistic expectations should thus be clearly defined prior to treatment, by presenting both absolute and relative risks.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:40:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven studies were identified. The data from the trials included in this review pose some concerns. Their methodological quality was variable and some clinical heterogeneity existed. Details of the methods and quality can be referred to in the 'Characteristics of included studies' and 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:41:50 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies lack information on adverse effects, only reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>). The primary outcome of live birth was only reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:42:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence was varied. Adequate sequence generation was described by three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Battacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Battacharya 2008</LINK> adequately described allocation concealment. The data may not be generalisable.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-09-24 14:44:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Important clinical differences between included studies in terms of populations and interventions should be remembered in generalising to other settings. Surgically treated endometriosis was present in 40% of the patients reported by <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>. Although the effectiveness of clomiphene in these women may be different from other groups, data from a large cohort study of women attending Canadian university fertility clinics suggested a similar effect when clomiphene was used for infertility associated with early stages of endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another concern is the potential for adverse effects. Only one trial reported adverse effects. There were no identified cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The rate of miscarriage did not differ from the expected rate and could not be extrapolated between crossover arms. The same occurred for multiple pregnancies and other adverse events such as ectopic pregnancies.<BR/>Multiple pregnancy risk (10%), transient hot flushes (approximately 11%), and the visual disturbances of blurred vision and diplopia (1% to 3%) are reported from other sources (<LINK REF="REF-Compendium-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compendium 1998</LINK>). Although concerns have been raised over a possible association between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer, the researchers did not focus on any specific drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Whittemore-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittemore 1992</LINK>). A case-cohort study has suggested a link with clomiphene when used for more than 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Rossing-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossing 1994</LINK>). Thus, if clomiphene has been unsuccessful after six to nine months it should probably be discontinued.</P>
