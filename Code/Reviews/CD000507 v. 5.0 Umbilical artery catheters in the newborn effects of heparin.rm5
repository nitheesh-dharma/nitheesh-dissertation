<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The umbilical artery catheters (tubes) (UACs) commonly used in neonatal intensive care to monitor babies can sometimes cause them problems. They can be placed in high or low positions, and come in different materials and designs. The blood anticoagulant, heparin, theoretically helps prevent blood clots forming (thromboses), but high doses could lead to haemorrhage (bleeding). This review found that low heparin doses are effective in preventing catheters becoming blocked and needing to be re-inserted. There is not enough evidence to rule out the possibility of adverse effects. Heparin does not seem to lower the rate of blood clots in the major artery.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-10-28 15:16:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of umbilical catheterization use were obtained using the search methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. <I>The Cochrane Library, </I>MEDLINE (search via PubMed), CINAHL and EMBASE were searched from 1999 to 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized trials in newborn infants of any birthweight or gestation. <BR/>Comparison of heparinised to non heparinised infusion fluids, including comparison of heparin in the infusate to heparin just in the flush solution.<BR/>Clinically important end points such as catheter occlusion or aortic thrombosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>There were five randomized controlled trials retrieved. All gave details of the incidence of catheter occlusion. Two also reported the incidence of aortic thrombosis. The intervention was reasonably consistent: heparin in the infusate at a concentration of 1 unit/mL was investigated in all trials except one which used a concentration of 0.25 units/mL. Studies generally included both term and preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Heparinization of the infusate decreases the incidence of catheter occlusion but does not affect the frequency of aortic thrombosis. Heparinization of the flush solution is not an adequate alternative. <BR/>There does not appear to be an effect on frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage, death or clinical ischemic phenomena.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Heparinization of the fluid infused through an umbilical arterial catheter decreases the likelihood of umbilical arterial catheters occluding. The lowest concentration tested so far (0.25 units/mL) has been shown to be effective. Heparinization of flushes without heparinizing the infusate is ineffective. The frequency of aortic thrombosis has not been shown to be affected; however, the confidence intervals for this effect are very wide. The frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage has not been shown to be affected by heparinization of the infusate, but again the confidence intervals are very wide and even a major increase in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 intraventricular hemorrhage would not have been detected.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 22:33:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Umbilical arterial catheters (UACs) are among the most commonly used monitoring methodologies in neonatal intensive care. There seems to be significant variance between neonatal intensive care units in exactly how these catheters are used. This variance involves heparin dosing, catheter materials and catheter design and positioning of the catheter. Immediately after insertion of a UAC, local vascular compromise is frequently evident, usually in the form of blue or white toes, but occasionally with more severe and extensive ischemic manifestations. Aortic thrombi and renal ischemia have also been described. Some epidemiologic and case control studies have also shown that use of umbilical artery catheterisation is statistically associated with the later development of necrotizing enterocolitis. In order to minimize these morbidities some aspects of the use of UACs have been subjected to a small number of randomized control trials.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 22:34:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most NICUs now add heparin to the fluid being infused through the UAC. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-30 22:35:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several studies have examined whether this practice affects catheter occlusions or aortic thrombosis, and whether adding heparin to fluids used to intermittently flush the UAC, in place of adding heparin to the infusate, is adequate.</P>
<P>Heparin exposure at high dosage may be associated epidemiologically with an increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Lesko-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesko 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malloy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malloy 1995</LINK>). It is therefore necessary to ensure that heparinization of fluids does indeed have a benefit as well as to determine whether clinically important adverse effects have been reliably assessed in newborn infants.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 12:16:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original search strategy retrieved 849 articles. These were further reduced by restricting the search by use of the terms prospective, random#, control#, comparative or clinical. When studies of animal subjects and of epidural catheterisation were also removed, 233 reports remained. The abstract of each was read individually to determine if there was a possibility that the papers were reporting randomized prospective controlled trials. This final examination revealed six trials investigating heparin use, one of which was a trial published only as an abstract and reporting a study comparing heparinization of the infusate to full systemic heparinization (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald--1984" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1984</LINK>). This trial was excluded from further analysis. All five remaining trials included both term and preterm infants. Several of these trials do not give information regarding the total dose of heparin administered to the infants. This would, of course, be highly relevant to the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications. Where such information is given it is noted below. At the time of the updated search in 1999 one further randomized controlled trial was added (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ankola-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ankola 1993</LINK> performed a non-masked study in 30 infants who required catheter placement for clinical indications. Heparin was administered at a lower dose than any of the other studies at 0.25 units/mL. Total heparin dose received was 25 to 50 units per kg per day. Maximum heparin infusion rate was 38 (SD 7) U/kg/d. Major outcome variables were duration of catheter usability, catheter occlusion, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, clinical ischemic phenomena (blue discoloration of toes) and sepsis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bosque-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bosque 1986</LINK> randomised 47 infants to receive either heparin at a dose of 1 unit/mL added to the infusate and no heparin in the solution used to flush the catheter, or no heparin in the infusate and 1 unit/mL added to the flush solution. Infants were stratified by birth weight. The group with heparin in the infusate received 80 to 220 U/kg/d of heparin, with a mean of 120 U/kg/d. The group with heparin in the flush received 0.8 to 9.8 U/kg/d with a mean of 3.9 U/kg/d. The major outcome variables were catheter occlusion, ischemic complications, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-David-1981" TYPE="STUDY">David 1981</LINK> studied 50 infants (one later removed from analysis) randomly assigned to either 1 unit heparin/mL, in both the infusate and the flush, to no heparin in either fluid. Total heparin doses were not clearly stated but the highest dosage ranged from 125 to 200 U/kg/d. The major outcome variable of the study was the occurrence of aortic thrombi detected by single shot aortogram performed at the time of catheter removal, if the catheter had been in place for more than 24 to 72 hours. Autopsies, if available, were also used to determine aortic clots. Clotting studies were also performed</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK> performed a trial in 111 term and preterm infants. Infants were randomly allocated to one of four nurseries. In two nurseries heparinized fluids were used, in the other two heparin was not used. The text also states that allocation to a particular nursery was based on the availability of bed space. This study may therefore have had 'haphazard' rather than truly random allocation, and allocation was certainly not masked. Both high and low catheters were allowed according to physician preference. Total heparin doses ranged from 0.46 to 3.4 U/kg/hr, with a mean of 0.9 U/kg/hr. Outcome variables reported were aortic thrombi determined by ultrasound, catheter occlusion, intraventricular hemorrhage of grade 3 or 4, sustained hypertension, (systolic pressure above 100 mm Hg or mean &gt;85 mm Hg in term infants and &gt; 70 mm Hg in premature infants).</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Rajani-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rajani 1979</LINK> performed a well masked randomized study with the randomization code maintained by pharmacy until the end of the study. 62 infants, term and preterm, were randomized to either heparin or placebo added at 1 unit/ml to the catheter infusate. Fluids ran at a minimum of 5 mL/hr in all but one infant, giving a total heparin dose in excess of 5 units/hr for all except one infant in the treatment group. It was noted in the discussion that patients received between 100 and 200 U/kg/d. Outcome variables were duration of catheter 'life-span', incidence of occlusion, clotting studies, and clinical ischemic phenomena defined as blue toes lasting for more than 8 hours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK> reported a prospective masked trial of heparin usage in umbilical catheters. This study assessed the effects of the use of heparin in both umbilical arterial and venous catheters, at a concentration of 1 unit/mL. The study only included preterm infants at risk for development of intraventricular hemorrhage by reason of a gestational age of less than 31 completed weeks gestational age. The study period was from birth to the fifth day of life, and heparin doses received by the infant averaged 4.3 U/kg/hr (no standard deviation given). The primary outcome variable was the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage, of any grade. Hemostatic variables were also determined and compared between groups. Mortality rates and severe intraventricular hemorrhage rates were reported and are included in the meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Heparin in the infusate clearly decreases the incidence of catheter occlusion; (four trials 252 infants) typical Relative Risk 0.20; (95% CI 0.11, 0.35) (Outcome 1.1.1). This result was remarkably consistent between studies.</P>

Neither of the two studies that examined this showed an effect (<LINK REF="STD-David-1981" TYPE="STUDY">David 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK>). The overall relative risk was 0.71; 95% CI 0.42, 1.22 (Outcome 1.2).</P>
<P>Coagulation studies were described in several reports (<LINK REF="STD-David-1981" TYPE="STUDY">David 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK>, Bosque 1985, <LINK REF="STD-Rajani-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rajani 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK>). The timing of performance of the studies, methodologic details and detail of reporting of the results varied so greatly that a meta-analysis was not performed. However, in general terms none of the studies showed a significant prolongation of prothrombin or partial thromboplastin times. <LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK> did not show an effect on fibrinogen concentrations; <LINK REF="STD-David-1981" TYPE="STUDY">David 1981</LINK> did not show an effect on thrombin or reptilase times; and <LINK REF="STD-Rajani-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rajani 1979</LINK> did not show an effect on antithrombin 3 concentrations, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK> showed a decrease in antithrombin 3 concentrations at the end of the study in the heparin group.</P>
<P>Hypertension was reported by only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK>) and was significantly reduced by the addition of heparin, relative risk 0.05; 95% CI 0.00, 0.78 (Outcome 1.3).</P>
<P>Grade 3 and 4 Intraventricular hemorrhage was not affected (<LINK REF="STD-Ankola-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ankola 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK>), relative risk 1.07; 95% CI 0.58, 1.99 (3 trials, 254 infants) (Outcome 1.4).</P>
<P>Clinical ischemic phenomena were reported by three of the studies; none reported a significant effect of heparinization. The overall RR was 1.28; 95% CI 0.66, 2.48 (3 trials, 139 infants) (Outcome 1.5).</P>
<P>Mortality was reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ankola-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ankola 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajani-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rajani 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK>). Each failed to show a significant difference between heparinized and non-heparinized fluids. The overall relative risk was 0.87; 95% CI 0.50, 1.49 (Outcome 1.6). <LINK REF="STD-David-1981" TYPE="STUDY">David 1981</LINK> mentioned that mortality was not significantly different between groups, but did not give figures.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 12:23:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The one excluded study (McDonald 1984) compared full systemic heparinization using 20 - 25 U/kg/hr of heparin to heparinization of the infusate (1 - 2 U/mL). The first 19 infants in the study were reported in an abstract. The incidence of aortic thrombosis, determined by aortography, was reported as 1/11 with full heparinization vs. 4/8 with heparinized infusate. These proportions are not statistically significant by Fisher exact test. The abstract stated that the intervention was "without complications including ICH". We will attempt to obtain further information regarding this study. In particular, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage will be sought.</P>
<P>Heparinization of the infusate appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of catheter occlusion. This leads to an increase in the usable lifespan of the catheter. There is not a statistically significant effect of heparinization on the frequency of aortic thrombi. However, the confidence intervals for this effect are wide, as only 134 infants have been evaluated for this common and important outcome. Thus it remains possible that a decrease in aortic thrombosis of as much as 50% could have been missed in the studies published to date. The lack of documented effect of heparin on aortic thrombosis, if confirmed in further studies, may suggest that mechanical factors may be more important, or that systemic anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent this complication. Clinically apparent ischemic phenomena were also unaffected by heparinization, again suggesting that mechanical factors may be most important in determining the frequency of blue or white toes.</P>
<P>There was no effect of routine use of heparin on mean values of coagulation tests or on analyses of clotting factors. The decrease in AT3 demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1997</LINK> is of questionable significance, in general heparin administration has been associated with an increase in AT3 levels, so a slight decrease, which remained within the accepted normal range is of uncertain significance. The wide range of administered heparin doses means that there remains a possibility of an effect of heparin on coagulation in that group of infants who receive greater volumes of heparinized fluids.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were not noted. The incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was not different between groups, but it must be remembered that almost all of these studies included infants of all gestational ages, many of whom would be at very low risk for this complication. A relatively small number of infants have been evaluated for extensive intracranial hemorrhage (n = 254). The confidence intervals for effect on intracranial hemorrhage are very wide and still include the possibility that routine addition of heparin to umbilical artery catheters doubles the incidence of grade 3 and 4 hemorrhages! The actual total dose of heparin differed widely because of varying infusion rates, and was not standardized between groups. Infants who receive the highest doses of heparin may be at increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage as suggested by two epidemiologic studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lesko-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesko 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malloy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malloy 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality was also not significantly affected by heparinization (n evaluated = 316), but again the confidence intervals are very wide. There are no clear data on the frequency of necrotising enterocolitis which was an outcome variable in only one study (the incidence in both groups was zero, <LINK REF="STD-Ankola-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ankola 1993</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Heparinization of fluids administered via umbilical arterial catheter appears to decrease the incidence of catheter occlusion, so prolonging the life of the catheter. The effective concentration may be as low as 0.25 units/mL. Until further data are available it appears to be reasonable to use the lowest effective concentration of heparin to maintain catheter patency.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research should evaluate the efficacy of using even lower concentrations of heparin. Other methods for reducing catheter occlusions or preventing aortic thrombosis, such as the use of heparin bonded catheters, should be compared to heparinization. Because of the imprecision of our estimates of the risk of heparinization of infusates on hemorrhagic complications and the effects on major thrombotic complications, further research must adequately assess the incidence of<BR/>aortic thrombosis and of major intraventricular hemorrhage.</P>
