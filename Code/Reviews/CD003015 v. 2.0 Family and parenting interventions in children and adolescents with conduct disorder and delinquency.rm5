<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Conduct disorder and delinquency are significant problems for children and adolescents and their families, with the potential to consume much of the resources of the health, social care and juvenile justice systems. A number of family and parenting interventions have been recommended and are used for these conditions. The aim of this review was to determine if these interventions are effective in the management of conduct disorder and delinquency in children and adolescents, aged 10-17.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if family and parenting interventions improve the child/adolescent's behaviour; parenting and parental mental health; family functioning and relations; and have an effect on the long term psychosocial outcomes for the child/adolescent.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:03:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Randomised controlled trials were identified in September 1999 through searching the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CCTR), databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociofile, ERIC, Healthstar), reference lists of articles and contact with authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials with a major focus on parenting and/or family functioning were eligible for inclusion in the review. Trials needed to include at least one objective outcome measure (e.g. arrest rates) or have used a measure that had been published in peer review publications and validated for the relevant purpose. Studies were required to have a control group, which could be a no intervention group, a wait list group or a usual intervention group (e.g. probation).</P>
<P>Trials in children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years with conduct disorder and/or delinquency and their families were considered. Conduct disorder was defined by a standardised psychological assessment (for example, using a child behaviour checklist), or a psychiatric diagnosis. Delinquency was defined by a referral from a juvenile justice or another legal system for a child/adolescent who has committed a serious crime e.g assault and/or offended on at least two occasions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently reviewed all eligible studies for inclusion, assessed study quality (allocation concealment, blinding, follow up, clinically important outcomes) and extracted data. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi squared test of heterogeneity along with visual inspection of the data. A significance level less than 0.1 was interpreted as evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity. For data where heterogeneity was found the reviewers looked for an explanation. If studies with heterogeneous results were thought to be comparable the statistical synthesis of the results was done using a random effects model. This model takes into account within-study sampling error and between-studies variation in the assessment of uncertainty and will give wider confidence intervals to the effect size and hence a more conservative result.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the effects of the varying quality of the studies included on the results.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of the nine hundred and seventy titles initially identified through the search strategy, eight trials met the inclusion criteria. A total of 749 children and their families were randomised to receive a family and parenting intervention or to be in a control group. In seven of these studies the participants were juvenile delinquents and their families and in only one the participants were children/adolescents with conduct disorder who had not yet had contact with the juvenile justice system.</P>
<P>At follow up, family and parenting interventions significantly reduced the time spent by juvenile delinquents in institutions (WMD 51.34 days, 95%CI 72.52 to 30.16). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of a juvenile delinquent being re arrested (RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.44 to 0.98) and in their rate of subsequent arrests at 1-3 years (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -1.100 to - 0.03). For both of these outcomes there was substantial heterogeneity in the results suggesting a need for caution in interpretation. At present there is insufficient evidence that family and parenting interventions reduce the risk of being incarcerated (RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.21). No significant difference was found for psychosocial outcomes such as family functioning, and child/adolescent behaviour.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence suggests that family and parenting interventions for juvenile delinquents and their families have beneficial effects on reducing time spent in institutions. This has an obvious benefit to the participant and their family and may result in a cost saving for society. These interventions may also reduce rates of subsequent arrest but at present these results need to be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the results.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:32:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:09:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Conduct disorder is a psychiatric category that is defined as a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive, defiant or antisocial behaviour. It is one of the commonest forms of psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents with an estimated prevalence of between 1.5% and 3.4% in this age group. It affects three times as many boys as girls. (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1998</LINK>)</P>
<P>In contrast delinquency is a sociolegal category, that refers to children and adolescents who break the law. Delinquency rates are highest in the middle teen years. Approximately 2% of children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years come in contact with the juvenile justice system each year. Of these, there is a minority who persist in offending (recurrent juvenile delinquents) and who account for a disproportionately large percentage of court appearances (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1996</LINK>). It is widely accepted that the best predictors for future recurrent delinquency are early conduct problems (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheldrick--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldrick 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>It appears that conduct disorder is stable over time. The vast majority of affected children and adolescents go on to lead lives in which many domains of functioning are adversely affected (<LINK REF="REF-Rey-et-al-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey et al 1995</LINK>). Conduct problems may escalate in adolescence when there is an increased demand on an ability to function outside the family, to respond to the demands of society, the legal system, peers and school. This behaviour may become increasingly severe and complex and may be labelled as "delinquent" (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>). In addition, adult manifestations of conduct disorder and delinquency include psychiatric disorders such as Antisocial Personality Disorder, and non-psychiatric antisocial behaviours such as theft and violence. (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conduct disorder and delinquency may be present in association with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and internalising disorders such as depression. These co-morbidities will negatively influence the clinical picture and prognosis. Differentiating among these conditions may be complicated. The persistent pattern of aggressive, defiant or antisocial behaviour with accumulating legal ramifications, however, is unique to conduct disorder (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conduct disorder and delinquency appear to have a number of associated risk factors, which include genetic, biological and environmental causes. Environmental causes include family factors such as parenting style and attachment, parental mental illness, antisocial parents, harsh and erratic discipline, child abuse and neglect, poor parental supervision, parental substance abuse, parental rejection of the child, parental disharmony, single parenthood and large family size. Poverty is also associated with an increased risk of conduct disorder and delinquency, probably because it exacerbates family dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheldrick--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldrick 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Family and parenting interventions hold that family interaction may cause, maintain or worsen conduct disorder and delinquency and that if family relationships are appropriately mobilised they can be a potent therapeutic agent for reducing unwanted behaviours and preventing relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-et-al-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond et al 1996</LINK>). There are a number of family and parenting interventions that have been recommended for the intervention of conduct disorder and delinquency (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldrick--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldrick 1995</LINK>). These range from parent training, which attempts to alter specific family interactions by improving parenting skills, to Multi-systemic therapy (MST), a broad-based intervention that targets family and extra-familial factors such as parenting, school and peer relationships (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>). This may occur in the context of out of home placement eg Multi-dimensional intervention Foster Care (MTFC) (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is extensive literature on the predictors and risk factors associated with conduct disorder and delinquency, there is little on the effectiveness of prevention and intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldrick--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldrick 1995</LINK>). Recently Barlow (1997) conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of 'group based' parent training programs in improving behaviour problems in 3-10 year old children (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-J-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow J 1997</LINK>). The authors found that group based parent training programs have a positive impact on the behaviour of children between the ages of 3-10 years. However, these findings may not be applicable to the over 10 year old age group with severe conduct disorder and delinquency.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1995</LINK> conducted a descriptive review to determine the effectiveness of family therapy in the intervention of adolescents with conduct disorder and delinquency. Seven studies fulfilled the following criteria: they had a control or comparison group; they involved a specific method of family intervention; and they measured the effectiveness of intervention of adolescents referred for conduct disorder and/or delinquency. The authors found that the studies focussed on participants with conduct problems of varying severity, used a range of measurement strategies and used different service delivery models. They concluded that the studies indicated that family therapy interventions appear to decrease adolescent conduct problems and delinquent behaviour when compared to individual therapy, intervention as usual or no therapy. However this review had a number of methodological weaknesses in that the studies analysed were not limited to randomised controlled trials and only one database (PsycLIT) was searched.</P>
<P>There is a potential for significant adverse short and long term outcomes from conduct disorder and delinquency. It is important that the effects of family and parenting interventions recommended for these conditions is evaluated and, in particular, their effectiveness in preventing or minimising these adverse long term outcomes. This is vital as older children and adolescents who have conduct disorder or delinquency have the potential to consume much of the resources of the health and juvenile justice with considerable cost to society (<LINK REF="REF-Borduin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borduin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>).</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Relevant trials were identified through searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) and the following databases:</P>
<P>Biomedical Sciences Databases:<BR/>MEDLINE (Sept 1999)<BR/>EMBASE (Sept 1999)<BR/>PsycINFO (Sept 1999) <BR/>CINAHL ( Sept 1999) </P>
<P>Social Sciences and general references databases:<BR/>Sociofile (Sept 1999)<BR/>ERIC (Sept 1999)<BR/>Healthstar (Sept 1999)</P>
<P>All terms necessary to the intervention (family therapy, multisystemic therapy and parent training), and the participant groups (individuals aged 10 to 17, conduct disorder, aggressive behaviour, juvenile delinquency, child behaviour disorder, social behaviour disorder) were used. Filters appropriate to each database, designed to locate potential quasi-randomised controlled trials and randomised controlled trials, were used. Search terms were modified to meet the requirements of individual databases as regards to differences in fields and trial filters. No language restrictions were employed. </P>
<P>Other sources of information examined included the bibliographies of systematic and non-systematic reviews and reference lists of articles identified through the search strategy. Experts in the field were contacted by letter in order to identify unpublished studies. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:03:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The titles and abstracts from the search were screened by SW. Articles that clearly did not fulfil inclusion criteria as judged by titles and abstracts were rejected by SW. "Hopeful looking" articles were retrieved. Studies under consideration were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness as per The Cochrane Handbook (Clarke &amp; Oxman 1999). This method provides an assessment of the extent to which bias may have affected the study results ie high, moderate or low risk of bias. Assessments were based on two validity criteria:</P>
<P>&#8226; Adequacy of allocation concealment. This was classified as "adequate" (e.g. centralised randomisation process), "unclear" (i.e randomisation not described), "inadequate" (i.e sequential or consecutive), "not used"<BR/>&#8226; Blinding. This was determined by the study being tested with the following questions: "were the recipients of care unaware of their assigned intervention?", "were those providing care unaware of assigned therapy?", "were persons responsible for outcome assessment unaware of assigned therapy?"</P>
<P>Reporting of clinically important outcomes and completeness of follow up were also assessed. Articles were judged independently by two reviewers (SW, KW) and any differences were negotiated with a third reviewer (JP).</P>
<P>A data extraction form was developed based on these assessment criteria. Data extraction was performed by SW and KW. The information extracted included study location, methods, participant details, type of intervention, duration of intervention and outcome.</P>
<P>Data synthesis was performed using RevMan 4.1, the latest version of Cochrane analysis software. For continuous outcome data, such as family functioning, the mean score for each outcome between the two groups was compared at follow up using a standardised mean difference (SMD) where outcome measures differed between studies or a weighted mean difference (WMD) where studies used the same measure. For dichotomous outcome data, such as number of re-arrests, a risk ratio and its 95 percent confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated to compare the groups at follow up.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity (within and between study variation) was assessed using the Chi squared test of heterogeneity along with visual inspection of the data. A significance level less than 0.1 was interpreted as evidence of important heterogeneity. For data where heterogeneity was found the reviewers looked for an explanation, such as differences in study quality. If studies with heterogeneous results were thought to be comparable the statistical synthesis of the results was done using a random effects model. This model takes into account within-study sampling error and between-studies variation in the assessment of uncertainty and will give wider confidence intervals to the effect size and hence a more conservative result.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the effects of the varying quality of the studies included on the results. Studies with concealment allocation was "unclear", "inadequate" or "not used" were excluded in this sensitivity analysis.</P>

Two studies had more than 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>), five studies had 50 to 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>) and one had under 50 participants (Raue &amp; Spence 1985).</P>
<P>In seven of the studies, the participants and their families were referred to the intervention programs by juvenile justice systems from six states from the United States of America (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). These participants were all chronic and/or serious offenders. Their ages ranged from 11 to 17 years. Two studies had only male participants and four had participants from both sexes. The other study was conducted in Australia (Raue &amp; Spence 1985). This was the only study where the participants had been assessed as having conduct disorder but had not had contact with the juvenile justice system. The participants in this study were aged 10 to 16 years and included both sexes.</P>
<P>There was a wide range of family and parenting interventions. They included Short Term Family Intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>), parent training (<LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; Raue &amp; Spence 1985), Multi-systemic therapy (MST) (<LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>), Multi-dimensional Treatment foster care (MTFC) (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>), and an Adolescent Diversion Project with a family condition and a multi-focus condition (<LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>). There was a wide range of control groups, which included "usual intervention" controls, "wait list controls" and "no intervention controls". The interventions for the "usual intervention" group were heterogenous and varied from probation, court, out of home placement to individual, and "non experimental" forms of family therapy.</P>
<P>The duration of intervention was expressed in different time units in different studies. Duration varied from 23.9 hours of contact time to 6 months with assessment periods every two months. The follow up periods for the studies ranged from 6 months to 3 years.</P>

<P>All studies were randomised controlled trials. While all 8 stated that random allocation was used to allocate participants to the intervention and control group, only 4 studies had adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>). In three studies concealment allocation was unclear and further information on randomisation was unable to be obtained by the reviewers from the trial authors (Raue &amp; Spence 1985; <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>). In one study it was stated that although the aim was that subjects be randomly allocated (method of allocation concealment not described) there were "minor exceptions caused by program availability " and therefore allocation concealment was deemed to be inadequate by the reviewers (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 7 of the studies blinding of the assessors to the intervention was deemed adequate as follow up data on objective outcomes was archival (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). These studies relied on juvenile justice records for their objective outcomes such as re-arrest data.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of family and parenting interventions on the child/adolescent's behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reported on the effect of family and parenting interventions on the child/adolescent's behaviour. (<LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>; Raue &amp; Spence 1985 ).

<P>Seven of the included studies had objective outcomes in the form of archival data on criminal behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). Objective data on rate of re-arrests, mean institution time and incarceration was compared at one to two years follow up. Continuous outcome data in terms of the rate of subsequent arrests was compare at 1-3 year's follow up. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>) gave archival criminal activity data at 6 months but this could not be used in comparison with other trials as a only a mean value was provided without a standard deviation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of re-arrest</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies described a decrease in the number of re-arrests in the juvenile delinquents receiving the family or parenting intervention. Five of the seven studies gave dichotomous outcome data at one to two-year follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK> ). When the data from these studies was pooled, family and parenting interventions significantly reduced the risk of a juvenile delinquent being re-arrested after the intervention, compared to those having usual interventions (RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.44 to 0.98; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). When <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK> were excluded in the sensitivity analysis based on study quality, the data revealed that MST/MTFC significantly reduced the risk of a juvenile delinquent being re-arrested after these interventions, compared to those having usual interventions (probation, individual therapy or group care) by a greater effect size (RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.37 to 0.81; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borduin-et-al-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borduin et al 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>) gave continuous outcome data in terms of the rate of subsequent arrests. Family and parenting interventions significantly reduced the rate of subsequent arrests for a juvenile delinquent at 1-3 years (SMD -0.56, 95%CI -1.100 to - 0.03; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). When <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK> was excluded in the sensitivity analysis based on study quality, the data revealed that MST/MTFC significantly reduced the rate of subsequent arrests for a juvenile delinquent at 1-3 years after these interventions compared to those having usual interventions (probation, individual therapy or group care), SMD -0.68 (95%CI -1.29 to - 0.07; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to note that for both of these outcomes there was a significant amount of heterogeneity in the pooled data even after sensitivity analysis for quality so this result needs to be interpreted with caution. This indicates that although MST/MTFC are similar interventions for similar populations (chronic serious delinquents) there are still enough differences between the studies to bring into question the appropriateness of pooling the data.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mean length of time in institutions</HEADING>
<P>Five of the studies reported a decrease in time spent in institutions (eg prison, detention) for juvenile delinquents receiving family and parenting interventions. Four of the studies reported data as "institution time in days" (<LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). A weighted mean difference (WMD) was used in data synthesis. Family and parenting interventions significantly decreased the amount of time spent by juvenile delinquents in institutions at follow up compared to those who received usual interventions (WMD: -51.34 days, 95%CI -72.52 to -30.16; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). When <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK> was excluded in the sensitivity analysis based on study quality, the data revealed that MST/MTFC significantly decreased the amount of time spent by juvenile delinquents in institutions at follow up compared to those who received group care or probation (WMD: - 56.52, 95%CI -83.83, -29.20; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of incarceration</HEADING>
<P>Only two studies reported outcome data on the number of juvenile delinquents who had been incarcerated during the one to two year follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). These were both studies using MST in chronic serious juvenile delinquents. The pooled relative risk of incarceration was 0.50 (95%CI 0.20 to 1.21; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity between the results of these two studies. The source of this heterogeneity is unclear given the apparent similarity in the participants and interventions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Self-reported delinquency</HEADING>
<P>Three studies used self-report delinquency scales, Self-Report Delinquency Scale and Elliot Behavioural Checklist, to measure criminal activity (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). As the outcome data had been collected using different instruments it was necessary to use a standardised mean difference to combine the three sets. Pooled data revealed a significant difference between the intervention group (MST and MTFC) and the usual intervention group (Group Care or probation), SMD: -0.41 (95%CI -0.65 to -0.17; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:13:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Conduct disorder and delinquency are significant problems for children and adolescents and their families with adverse short and long-term outcomes. In addition these problems have the potential to consume much of the resources of the health and juvenile justice systems with considerable cost to society.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in time spent in institutions by juvenile delinquents who had received family and parenting interventions. It is not clear from the studies if judges were blind to the intervention allocation when adjudicating over a young person who had been re-arrested. It is therefore possible that their decisions about incarceration may have been affected by their knowledge of a juvenile delinquent's intervention allocation. For example if a juvenile delinquent had re-offended but had committed a relatively minor crime, the judge may have been more lenient if he was aware that the offender was allocated to a family and parenting intervention. On the other hand the judge might have been more punitive thus biasing the study against finding an effect of the interventions.</P>
<P>We found that this intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of a juvenile delinquent being re arrested (RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.44 to 0.98) and in their rate of subsequent arrests at 1-3 years (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -1.100 to - 0.03). , However it is important to note that for both of these outcomes there was a significant amount of heterogeneity in the pooled data even after exclusion of the poorer quality studies so this result needs to be interpreted with caution. Meta-analysis of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>) found that at present there is insufficient evidence that family and parenting interventions reduce the risk of being incarcerated (RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.21).</P>
<P>These reductions in mean length of time spent in institutions and the possible reduction in rearrest rate indicate that family and parenting interventions may benefit for the children and adolescents and their family and result in a considerable cost saving for society. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK> costed the savings of such family and parenting interventions as $US 100 000 over a 3 year period.</P>
<P>There was a significant reduction in self-reported delinquency in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>). This adds further support to the archival data and is important because it reflects the young person's own report of their criminal activity, rather than relying on them being caught. However it is also possible a family and parenting intervention may affect the amount that children and adolescents report on their true level of criminal activity. This would introduce bias that would lead to either an over or under estimation of the intervention effect.</P>
<P>In three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-et-al-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler et al 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bank-et-al-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bank et al 1990</LINK> ) a significant time effect was reported with a decrease in criminal activity for both the intervention and usual intervention groups at follow-up (6 months, 1.7 and 3 years respectively). This indicates that there are factors other than the intervention that play a role in reducing criminal activity. Possible explanations may be the fact that juvenile delinquents in the usual intervention groups were also receiving therapy or that criminal activity improves with increasing age due perhaps to increasing maturity of the participant (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial had school attendance as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Emshoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Emshoff 1983</LINK> ). There was a concerning trend toward decreasing school enrolment in juvenile delinquents which was less marked in the broad-based intervention groups but was not reversed by this therapy. There are a number of factors that influence school attendance, such as learning disabilities, ADHD, peer group support, student-teacher relationships, lower socioeconomic status that were not the major focus of the family and parenting interventions. Of note, none of the trials gave an indication of academic performance in the children and adolescents involved which is an important indicator for future opportunities, and employment. In addition, this review did not have outcome data on long term outcomes such as employment, mental health and criminality as an adult.</P>
<P>This review reflects the findings of other reviews carried out in the field of psychosocial interventions, where a large number of potential studies are reduced to a small number due to methodological flaws. Despite a rigorous approach to selection in this review, there were still a number of methodological weaknesses in the included trials, as described.</P>
<P>The findings of this review persisted and were strengthened with sensitivity analysis that took quality of the studies into account. This sensitivity analysis was in effect a post-hoc subgroup analysis because it excluded non MST/MTFC studies. Nevertheless, significant statistical heterogeneity persisted for the re-arrest data in this analysis even using a random effects model. This persistence may reflect the wide range of usual interventions, including probation, group care and individual therapy used in different juvenile justice systems and to a lesser extent variability between the family and parenting interventions. As a result this statistically significant heterogeneity limits the interpretation and usefulness of the finding of significant reductions in the risk of rearrest.</P>
<P>By including all eligible trials systematic reviews aim to avoid biased ascertainment. However bias may arise if published or unpublished studies are missed. All the included studies in this review were published, the majority in peer review journals. No unpublished studies were identified by the search strategy or contact with experts in the field therefore this review has the potential for publication bias.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:32:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:32:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The evidence suggests that family and parenting interventions for juvenile delinquents and their families, particularly Multi-systemic Therapy and Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care, have beneficial effects in reducing the length of time spent by juvenile delinquents in institutions subsequent to these interventions. In addition to the obvious benefit to the participant and their family, such interventions may also result in a cost saving for society. These interventions may also reduce rates of subsequent arrest but at present these results need to be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the results. There is preliminary evidence that may suggest that these interventions have a "spill over" effect of reducing future sibling delinquency (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>At present there is insufficient evidence that family and parenting interventions reduce the risk of a juvenile delinquent being incarcerated or have a beneficial effect on parenting, parental mental health, family functioning, academic performance, future employment, and peer relations. Although there is no evidence that family and parenting interventions such as Multi-systemic Therapy cause harm, such therapies are labour intensive. This has practical implication for making decisions about the implementation of these programs when prioritising resource allocation.</P>
<P>In all but one of these studies included in this review the participants were juvenile delinquents and their families residing in the USA. Therefore, it can be argued that the applicability of such studies is limited to children and adolescents in the juvenile justice system in the USA.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A methodological issue with pooling these studies was the wide range of family and parenting interventions and "usual intervention" controls. The substantial heterogeneity of results for most outcomes may reflect the fact that all of the participants and their families were referred by different juvenile justice systems in different States. This heterogeneity limits the interpretation and usefulness of pooled data. Future studies of family and parenting interventions, particularly MST/MTFC should, where practically possible, try to minimise this within and between study variability in their study design. This will hopefully allow for more useful meta-analyses to be performed. In addition, the authors of this review will consider performing subgroup analysis of trials by intervention type, as these trials become available. </P>
<P>Of concern, only one randomised controlled trial was able to be included in this review where the participants had been assessed as having conduct disorder but had not yet had contact with the juvenile justice system. In addition, studies that had a focus on parent training, non-MST/MTFC family interventions and children with conduct disorder without delinquency tended to be of poor quality. It is therefore difficult to make any clear comment about the efficacy of these interventions. Well designed, randomised controlled trials of family and parenting interventions for conduct disordered children over 10 who have not yet been in contact with the legal system are required. </P>
<P>There is an increasing focus in the literature on the role of early intervention (the first three years) to prevent conduct disorder and delinquency. However, there will always be children, who, for various reasons do not access early intervention services or who have conduct problems despite early intervention. To help these children and adolescents effective interventions need to be identified that will minimise the future negative impact of conduct disorder and delinquency, and can be used when problems arise.</P>
