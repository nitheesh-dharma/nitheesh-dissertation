<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Taurine is an amino acid that helps infants absorb fat from the gastrointestinal tract and ensures that the liver deals with waste products efficiently. Taurine may also have important roles in protecting nerves from damage, especially in the eyes and ears. This review sought evidence that supplementing the diet of preterm and low birth weight infants with taurine improves their growth and development. Nine small trials were found, but these did not provide any evidence that providing extra taurine improved outcomes. However, further trials of taurine supplementation are not likely to take place since taurine is naturally present in breast milk and current standard practice is to add taurine to formula milk and to intravenous nutrition solutions for feeding preterm and low birth weight infants. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in breast milk. Evidence exists that taurine has important roles in intestinal fat absorption, hepatic function, and auditory and visual development in preterm or low birth weight infants. Observational data suggest that relative taurine deficiency during the neonatal period is associated with adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. Current standard practice is to supplement formula milk and parenteral nutrition solutions with taurine.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of providing supplemental taurine for enterally or parenterally fed preterm or low birth weight infants on growth and development.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - June 2007), EMBASE (1980 - June 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared taurine supplementation versus no supplementation in preterm or low birth weight newborn infants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine small trials were identified. In total, 189 infants participated. Most participants were greater than 30 weeks gestational age at birth and were clinically stable. In eight of the studies, taurine was given enterally with formula milk. Only one small trial assessed parenteral taurine supplementation. Taurine supplementation increased intestinal fat absorption [weighted mean difference 4.0 (95% confidence interval 1.4, 6.6) percent of intake]. However, meta-analyses did not reveal any statistically significant effects on growth parameters assessed during the neonatal period or until three to four months chronological age [rate of weight gain: weighted mean difference -0.25 (95% confidence interval -1.16, 0.66) grams/kilogram/day; change in length: weighted mean difference 0.37 (95% confidence interval -0.23, 0.98) millimetres/week; change in head circumference: weighted mean difference 0.15 (95% confidence interval -0.19, 0.50) millimeters/week]. There are very limited data on the effect on neonatal mortality or morbidities, and no data on long-term growth or neurological outcomes. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite that lack of evidence of benefit from randomised controlled trials, it is likely that taurine will continue to be added to formula milks and parenteral nutrition solutions used for feeding preterm and low birth weight infants given the putative association of taurine deficiency with various adverse outcomes. Further randomised controlled trials of taurine supplementation versus no supplementation in preterm or low birth weight infants are unlikely to be viewed as a research priority, but there may be issues related to dose or duration of supplementation in specific subgroups of infants that merit further research.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Taurine, the major intracellular free amino acid in humans, is considered "conditionally essential" since needs are not met when intake is low (<LINK REF="REF-Sturman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturman 1995</LINK>). Preterm infants are especially dependent on an adequate dietary intake to maintain plasma taurine levels because renal immaturity limits tubular reabsorption and low hepatic cystathionase activity limits biosynthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Sturman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturman 1980</LINK>). Taurine is not incorporated into protein. There is no distinct clinical phenotype associated with taurine deficiency in preterm infants. However, several lines of evidence suggest that taurine is important for growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Chesney-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesney 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chesney-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesney 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The concentration of taurine is highest in neural tissue, particularly in the developing brain. Taurine is an important intracellular osmolyte that helps regulate the volume of neurons in response to osmotic changes (<LINK REF="REF-Massieu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massieu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trachtman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trachtman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trachtman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trachtman 1990</LINK>). Taurine also has antioxidant and membrane stabilising properties that may be important in preventing tissue injuries such as periventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease, or necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Thibeault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thibeault 2000</LINK>). An observational study has found a correlation between low plasma taurine levels in early infancy and poor developmental outcome in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Wharton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wharton 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence exists that taurine is important for visual and auditory development. In neonatal animal models, taurine deficiency is associated with retinal abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imaki-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imaki 1993</LINK>). Children who receive prolonged parenteral nutrition without taurine develop electroretinographic abnormalities that resolve when their taurine deficiency is corrected (<LINK REF="REF-Geggel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geggel 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ament-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ament 1986</LINK>). Taurine is found at high concentrations in the inner ear (<LINK REF="REF-Horner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horner 1997</LINK>). Newborn kittens of cats who received supplemental taurine demonstrate earlier brainstem auditory evoked response maturation than kittens of cats who had not received supplemental taurine (<LINK REF="REF-Vallecalle-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallecalle 1991</LINK>). However, studies in term human infants suggest that relative taurine deficiency is associated with the development of more rapid auditory brainstem responses and that lower taurine levels aid auditory synaptic maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1998</LINK>). Additionally, taurine and aminoglycosides have synergistic ototoxic effects in some animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Taurine conjugates with bile acids to form bile salts that are needed for fatty acid absorption. Although glycine can also conjugate with bile acids, taurine conjugates predominate in human milk fed preterm infants during early infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Watkins-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 1983</LINK>). Taurine insufficiency is associated with impaired bile acid secretion, reduced absorption or fat and fat-soluble vitamins (particularly vitamin D), abnormal hepatic function, and hepatic cholestasis associated with prolonged administration of parenteral nutrition in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Sturman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Taurine is abundant in human milk, but it is present in much lower concentrations in cow milk and is removed in the processing of infant formulae (<LINK REF="REF-Rassin-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rassin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Agostini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostini 2000</LINK>). Preterm infants fed formula low in taurine have lower plasma taurine levels than those fed human milk (<LINK REF="REF-Gaull-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaull 1977</LINK>). Given the potential for taurine deficiency to affect growth and development, consensus statements have recommended that formula milk fed preterm infants receive about 4.5 to 9.0 milligrams per kilogram of taurine per day (<LINK REF="REF-Tsang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsang 1993</LINK>). Formula milks for preterm infants are supplemented with taurine to the same levels as found in human milk- about 3 to 8 milligrams per 100 millilitres (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). Similarly, observational studies have demonstrated that preterm infants who receive parenteral nutrition without supplemental taurine have depleted taurine body pools during the first weeks after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Zelikovic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelikovic 1990</LINK>). Modern amino acid solutions for parenteral nutrition contain levels of taurine that are more than sufficient to meet recommended needs (see: www.ashp.org/ahts). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effect of taurine supplementation for preterm or low birth weight infants on growth and development. The effects of enteral and parenteral taurine supplementation were evaluated in separate comparisons.</P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were planned:<BR/>1. Trials where participants were predominantly (more than 80%) very low birth weight (less than 1500 grams) or very preterm (born before 32 weeks gestation) infants. <BR/>2. Trials where the aim was to give more than 9 milligrams per kilogram per day of taurine (more than the enteral intake recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Tsang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsang 1993</LINK> ).</P>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Taurine supplementation versus no supplementation or placebo, by the parenteral or enteral route. Starting age should be within 28 days of birth.

</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This strategy consisted of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - June 2007), and EMBASE (1980 - June 2007) using the following text words and MeSH terms: Infant, Newborn OR infan* OR neonat* OR low birth weight OR LBW OR prematur* OR preterm AND taurine OR cysteine OR methionine OR sulfur amino acid OR sulphur amino acid. The search outputs were limited with the relevant search filters for clinical trials. No language restriction was applied. </P>
<P>References in previous reviews and included studies were examined. Abstracts presented at the Society for Pediatric Research and European Society for Pediatric Research between 1980 and 2006/7 were searched by hand. Trials reported only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information was available from the report or from contact with the authors to fulfil the inclusion criteria. The Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (1980 - 2005) was searched by hand. The UK National Research Register (http://www.nrr.nhs.uk) and Current Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com) websites were searched for completed or ongoing trials (MeSH terms: taurine, infants, newborn, nutrition). </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Two review authors screened the title and abstract of all of the studies identified by the above search strategy and the full text of the report of each study identified as of potential relevance. These independent assessments followed pre-specified guidelines for inclusion. The decision to include or exclude a specific study was made by consensus of all of the review authors.</P>
<P>2. The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. Trial quality in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of parents or caregivers and assessors to intervention, and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals was evaluated. </P>
<P>3. A data collection form to aid extraction of relevant information and data from each included study was used. Two review authors extracted the data separately. These data were compared and differences were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>4. The standard method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to analyse and synthesize the data. The fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis. The effects were expressed as relative risk and 95% confidence interval and risk difference and 95% confidence interval for categorical data.</P>
<P>5. Heterogeneity between trial results was examined by inspecting the forest plots and quantifying the impact of heterogeneity in any meta-analysis using a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies' results (I<SUP>2</SUP>- squared statistic). If statistical heterogeneity was detected, the review authors explored the possible causes (for example, differences in study quality, participants, intervention regimens, or outcome assessments) using post hoc subgroup analyses. </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Nine trials fulfilled the review inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bellentani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bellentani 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bijleveld-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bijleveld 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galeano-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Galeano 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvenpaa-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvenpaa 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michalk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Michalk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okamoto-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Okamoto 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tyson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zamboni-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zamboni 1993</LINK>). These are described in detail in the table, Characteristics of included studies. Two studies were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Harding-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wasserhess-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wasserhess 1993</LINK>; see table, Characteristics of excluded studies). </P>
<P>All of the included studies were undertaken during the late 1970s and 1980s by investigators attached to neonatal units in Europe and North America. In total, 189 infants participated. The participants in eight of the trials were clinically stable preterm or low birth weight infants who were fully enterally fed. The infants received taurine in formula milk at a concentration of between about 3 to 6 milligrams per 100 millilitres. Control infants received the same formula without added taurine. The intervention was continued for between three weeks and four months. One trial compared taurine supplementation (10.8 milligrams/kilogram/day) administered with parenteral nutrition for 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 1984</LINK>). Most trials assessed only short-term outcomes, principally growth parameters (usually weight) during the study period, changes in plasma levels of taurine, biochemical measures of hepatic function and nitrogen balance, and intestinal fat absorption. One trial assessed visual and auditory evoked potentials, and reported neonatal mortality and morbidities (<LINK REF="STD-Tyson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tyson 1989</LINK>). None of the trials assessed any long-term outcomes.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Methodological quality was generally poor. Only one trial attempted to maintain allocation concealment and to blind carers and assessors to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Tyson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tyson 1989</LINK>). Follow-up was complete or near complete in most of the studies. </P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The available data from randomised controlled trials do not provide any evidence that taurine supplementation of formula milk or parenteral nutrition has important clinical effects on growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infants. However, most participants in the identified trials were clinically stable infants of gestational age at birth greater than 30 weeks. None of the trials found that plasma taurine levels were affected by taurine supplementation. It may be that dietary taurine is not essential to maintain tissue levels for this population. Taurine may only be an essential dietary requirement in very preterm or critically ill infants where metabolic pathways for renal reabsorption and hepatic biosynthesis are insufficient to maintain tissue levels. The trial that recruited infants likely to fall into this category was underpowered (N = 47) to detect important effects on growth, development, or neonatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Tyson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tyson 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>All of the included trials were undertaken before addition of taurine to formula milk and parenteral nutrition solutions became standard practice in the mid-to-late 1980s. The introduction of this practice was prompted by reports of electroretinographic abnormalities associated with taurine deficiency in animal models and in children receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition without taurine (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geggel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geggel 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ament-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ament 1986</LINK>). The only trial in preterm infants that undertook electroretinographic assessments did not find any evidence of an effect of taurine supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Tyson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tyson 1989</LINK>). Taurine deficiency has also been associated with delayed auditory brainstem-evoked response maturation in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Vallecalle-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallecalle 1991</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="STD-Tyson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tyson 1989</LINK> reported that taurine supplementation resulted in a reduction in wave latency for auditory brainstem-evoked responses in one (of six) wave/frequency comparisons, the clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. In contrast, taurine supplementation in term infants has been associated with prolongation of auditory brainstem-evoked response wave latencies suggesting that taurine may delay auditory maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, evidence exists that taurine may exacerbate aminoglycoside ototoxicity, a potential adverse effect that is particularly relevant for very preterm infants where aminoglycosides are commonly prescribed during the neonatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial assessed the effect of parenteral taurine supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 1984</LINK>). This small study found no evidence that taurine affected biochemical indices of hepatic function. However, since the participating infants were clinically stable, and the duration of the trial was only ten days, it is not possible to determine whether parenteral taurine has an important effect on neonatal cholestasis. It may be worthwhile undertaking further studies to determine whether different doses and duration of taurine supplementation are effective in preventing or treating parenteral-nutrition associated cholestasis in very preterm or critically ill infants.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite that lack of data from randomised controlled trials, it is likely that taurine will continue to be added to formula milks and parenteral nutrition solutions used for feeding preterm and low birth weight infants. Current practice aims to provide taurine supplementation at similar input levels to those on human breast milk as it is assumed that supplementation to this level is not harmful. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the putative association of taurine deficiency with various adverse outcomes, further randomised controlled trials of taurine supplementation versus no supplementation in preterm or low birth weight infants are unlikely to be viewed as a research priority (<LINK REF="REF-Heird-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 2004</LINK>). There may be clinical questions relating to dose and duration of taurine supplementation in specific subgroups of preterm infants that should be addressed in future studies. </P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Taurine and cholesterol are constituents of human milk that are present in smaller amounts in infant formulas. Infants fed such formulas have lower plasma and urine concentrations of taurine and of serum total cholesterol. In the present investigation, in infants of 31 to 36 weeks gestational age, the effects of supplementing a 1.5 g/100 mL whey-predominant formula with taurine alone or with taurine plus cholesterol were examined. Infants fed the supplemented formula were compared with infants fed the unsupplemented formula and with infants fed pooled, expressed human milk (185 mL/kg/d). Approximately 45% of the human milk provided to each infant was that of the infant's mother (35% pasteurized and 10% fresh). From the time of reaching a weight of 2,400 g to 4 months of age the last group of infants was fed ad libitum. No consistent statistically significant differences in growth, as measured by rate of gain in crown-rump length, crown-heel length, or head circumference, were observed. There was a tendency, however, for the formula-fed infants to gain weight more slowly before reaching 2,400 g and to gain weight more quickly after a weight of 2,400 g was attained to 4 months of age. No differences in concentrations of BUN, total serum proteins, or acid-base status were observed among the formula-fed groups. The concentration of BUN increased in the formula-fed groups compared with the group fed human milk during the last half of the study. The formula-fed infants tended to have higher total serum proteins and to be slightly more acidotic than the infants fed human milk prior to discharge at a weight of 2,400 g but not thereafter. Thus, infants fed 185 mL/kg/d gained weight at rates comparable to those for fetuses of the same gestational age. Supplementation of formulas with taurine or taurine plus cholesterol did not produce changes in growth or general metabolism discernible under the present experimental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="YES" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Fasting duodenal bile acid concentrations and conjugation patterns were studied during the first 5 weeks of life in 65 low-birth-weight infants, 31 to 36 weeks of gestational age. One group was fed human milk.

The other infants, from 3 days of age, were fed one of three formulas: an adapted formula (F1), F1 supplemented with taurine (F2), or F1 supplemented with taurine and cholesterol (F3). The fasting intraluminal concentration of conjugated bile acids was higher in the infants fed human milk than in the infants fed formulas (F = 30.03, p less than .001) reflecting the higher concentrations of all individual bile acids. No significant increase over time was found in the concentration of total bile acids in any feeding group. Chenodeoxycholic acid concentrations, however, increased significantly over time in the infants fed human milk (r = .286, P less than .05). Thus, in the infants fed human milk, the ratio of cholates to chenodeoxycholates changed from 2.03 to 1.29 (P less than .001), whereas it remained stable (2.61) in the groups fed formula. Tauroconjugated bile acids predominated until at least 5 weeks of life in all the infants fed human milk, F2, or F3.

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Fat absorption and fasting duodenal bile acids were studied at 11 to 68 days of age in 66 healthy preterm infants, gestational age of 31 to 36 weeks and birth weight of 1,230 to 2,160 g. The infants fed human milk received pooled, expressed milk (55%), partly supplemented (35%) with their own mother's expressed milk. Approximately 10% of the milk was given by breastfeeding once per day. All expressed human milk not fed immediately was pasteurized at 62 degrees C for 30 minutes. The other three groups of infants received an adapted formula (F1), F1 supplemented with taurine (F2), or F1 supplemented with taurine and cholesterol (F3). In each group, fat was provided at 6.75 g/kg/d. The formulas had a fat concentration of 4.5 g/100 mL, containing 57.6% of unsaturated fatty acids from vegetable oils. In the infants fed human milk, fat absorption was consistently high, and no correlation was found between fat absorption and postnatal age. In the formula-fed infants, fat absorption increased with postnatal age (r = .310 P less than .05). When the duodenal concentration of total bile acids was above the median (3.6 mmol/L), fat absorption in the formula-fed infants exceeded 80%. There was a linear correlation between fat absorption and duodenal bile acids (r = .630, P less than .001) in the formula-fed infants. In the infants fed human milk, such correlation was not observed, and their intraluminal concentration of bile acids always exceeded 3.6 mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Plasma and urine concentrations of taurine were consistently lower in preterm infants fed unsupplemented formula than those observed in the infants fed human milk or formulas supplemented with taurine alone or with taurine plus cholesterol. Such supplementation of formula restored plasma and urine concentrations of taurine to those observed in the infants fed human milk. Taurine was the only amino acid that was present at lower concentrations in the infants fed unsupplemented formula than in those fed human milk. The other acidic and neutral amino acids were present in higher concentrations in the formula-fed infants than in the group fed human milk either during the early weeks of the study (serine, glutamine, glycine, alanine, tyrosine, and methionine) or consistently higher during the entire study (threonine, glutamate, citrulline, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Supplementation of formula with taurine plus cholesterol did not appear to have any effect on the amino acid concentrations in the plasma and urine, other than that on taurine itself. Plasma total cholesterol concentration decreased during the fifth to the 12th postnatal weeks of life in all feeding groups.

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to compare the influence of diet on the physiologic changes in bile acid kinetics, intraluminal bile acid concentrations, conjugation patterns, and nutrient lipid absorption, which occur postnatally. Preterm infants, 31-35 wk gestation, were fed one of four diets: (a) human milk pasteurized at 62 degrees C for 30 min, 55% from a pooled source, 35% from the infant's own mother, with the remainder (approximately 10%) being fresh human milk; (b) an adapted infant formula (F1); (c) F1 supplemented with taurine, 30 mumol/dl, (F2); and (d) F1 with both taurine, 30 mumol/dl, and cholesterol, 9.6 mg/dl, to a total of 12.7 mg/dl, the levels found in human milk (F3). In all infants, the bile acid pool size increased nearly twofold between 11 and 35 days, irrespective of dietary regimens. Taurine conjugation of bile acids predominated in all infants at 11 days of age and at 35 days in those infants fed human milk or the taurine-supplemented formulas. In taurine-supplemented formulas, the conjugation pattern did not influence bile acid kinetics.

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Taurine may be important to the developing eye and brain of the small preterm infant. A blinded randomized trial was conducted to determine whether taurine supplementation of healthy infants of less than or equal to 1,300 g birth weight until their discharge from the hospital increases their growth rate, neurobehavioral development, electroretinographic development, or maturation of auditory brainstem-evoked responses. Infants were fed with Similac Special Care as desired, which was prepared to contain less than 5 mg/L of taurine or 45 mg/L of taurine, a concentration similar to that of human milk. Infants who did not receive taurine supplementation (n = 19) and those who did (n = 18) were similar with respect to condition at study entry, caloric intake, and growth rates throughout the study, and electroretinographic findings and scores on the Brazelton Behavioral Assessment Scale at 37 weeks' postmenstrual age. Infants who received taurine supplementation had greater overall plasma taurine concentrations. The group receiving taurine supplementation also had more mature auditory-evoked responses at 37 weeks' postmenstrual age with a modest (0.2 to 0.5 ms) but consistent reduction (P less than .05) in the interval between stimulus and response at two different stimulation rates.
