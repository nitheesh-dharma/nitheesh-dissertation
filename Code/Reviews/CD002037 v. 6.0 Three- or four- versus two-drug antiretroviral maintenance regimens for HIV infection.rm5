<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Reducing the number of drugs in combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV after initial virologic response reduces the effectiveness of the treatment</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Combination antiretroviral therapy can lower the amount of HIV in the blood, improve immune system function, and slow the progress of HIV. It is thought these drugs will need to be used for life. Keeping up this therapy, though, is difficult, and there are concerns about the adverse effects of the drugs and the development of resistance to the drugs over time. Therefore, attempting to use fewer drugs has been tried. However, the review of trials comparing combinations of three or four drugs, in patients who successfully completed initial therapy, with using fewer drugs found that a reduced number of drugs could not suppress the virus as well.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Combination antiretroviral therapy administered to HIV-infected individuals has been shown to decrease viral replication, improve immunologic function and delay the progression of HIV infection. However, because patient adherence to complicated combination-therapy antiretroviral regimens is difficult and because of concerns regarding the cumulative toxicity of antiretroviral drugs, regimens that utilize fewer antiretroviral agents are desirable.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the use three- or four- versus two-drug antiretroviral maintenance regimens following successful initial therapy for HIV infection.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomized trials or reviews:<BR/>1. MEDLINE for the years 1982-May 2003 using the search terms human immunodeficiency virus, antiretroviral therapy, maintenance therapy, zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir, stavudine, saquinivir, nelfinavir, didanosine, zalcitabine, ritonovir, AIDS, anti-HIV agents, HIV infection and HIV seropositivity<BR/>2. AIDSLINE for the years 1982- May 2003 using the search terms antiretroviral therapy, maintenance therapy, zidovudine, lamidvudine, indinavir, stavudine, saquinivir, nelfinavir, didanosine, zalcitabine, ritonovir, anti-HIV agents<BR/>3. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register in the Cochrane Library, through May 2003<BR/>4. AIDSTRIALS, a specialist registry of current and completed trials maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine through May 2003.</P>
<P>The abstracts of relevant conferences, including the International Conferences on AIDS, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, the Infectious Disease Society of America annual meeting and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, as indexed by AIDSLINE, were also reviewed. Reference lists of all review articles and primary articles identified were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials in which HIV-infected adults who had successfully completed initial three- or four-drug antiretroviral therapy were randomized to maintenance therapy with three or four drugs or maintenance therapy with two drugs. Successful initial therapy was defined by a plasma viral load of less than 500 copies/ml.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality. Attempts were made to contact the authors of the included abstract. Data on the number of patients experiencing loss of viral suppression were abstracted by two reviewers. The data were pooled, where appropriate, to yield odds ratios, using random effects models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials were identified including three published studies and one abstract. Compared to three- or four-drug maintenance therapy, maintenance therapies including fewer drugs were associated with a higher risk of virologic failure (loss of HIV suppression to non-detectable levels). Combining the results of all four studies yielded an odds ratio of 5.55 (95% confidence interval, 3.14 - 9.80). Similar results were obtained when the one abstract was excluded (odds ratio, 5.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.82 - 10.65).</P>
<P>Performing subgroup analyses of studies using similar induction and maintenance regimens gave similar results. Maintenance regimens of zidovudine and lamivudine compared to maintenance regimens with zidovuine, lamivudine and indinavir, were associated with significantly higher rates of virologic failure (odds ratio, 4.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.80 - 11.58). Similarly, maintenace regimens that discontinued one or more protease inhibitor after including them in induction therapy were also associated with a significantly higher risk of virologic failure (odds ratio, 6.15; 95% confidence interval, 3.40 -11.10).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although it is desirable to reduce the number of antiretroviral drugs given in combination therapy for reasons of compliance and toxicity, maintenance regimens with fewer drugs are associated with significantly increased resistance and risk of loss of viral suppression. Successful initial therapy, as evidenced by suppresion of viral load, should not be modified in the maintenance phase unless clinically necessary.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Combination antiretroviral therapy, using two or more nucleoside reverse trancriptase inhibitors and a protease inhibitor, has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to reduce levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA in plasma, improve immunologic function and delay the progression of HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BHIVA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHIVA 1997</LINK>) and the standard of care for HIV infected patients is to use combination therapy using a three drug combination (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002c_-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO, 2002</LINK>). Our current understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV infection suggests that prolonged -- and possibily life-long -- therapy will be required to maintain suppression of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Havlir-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havlir 1996</LINK>). However, because patient adherence to complicated combination-therapy antiretroviral regimens is difficult and because of concerns regarding the cumulative toxicity of antiretroviral drugs, regimens that utilize fewer antiretroviral agents are desirable.</P>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of antiretroviral-sparing HIV maintenance therapies, we identified all studies evaluating the use of fewer antiretroviral drugs during the maintenance phase of HIV therapy following initial successful initial therapy with a four- or three-drug regimen.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare maintenance therapies for HIV infection containing the same drugs used in successful induction therapy and maintenance therapies using fewer antiretroviral drugs, we attempted to examine whether different types of maintenance regimens have differential effects on:</P>
<P>1. HIV replication measured by plasma viral load<BR/>2. Immunologic function measured by CD4+ cells per ul<BR/>3. Progression to AIDS-defining opportunistic infections<BR/>4. Patient adherence</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized controlled trials in which HIV-infected adults who had successfully completed three- or four-drug antiretroviral induction therapy were randomized to continue on the initial therapy regimen with three or four drugs or to an antiretroviral-sparing maintenance regimen with two drugs. Successful induction therapy was variously defined in each study with different non-detectable RNA cut-off values; the highest cut-off used was 500 copies/ml. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomized trials and reviews:<BR/>1. MEDLINE for the years 1982- May 2003 using the keywords human immunodeficiency virus, antiretroviral therapy, maintenance therapy, zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir, stavudine, saquinivir, nelfinavir, didanosine, zalcitabine, ritonavir, AIDS, anti-HIV agents, HIV infection and HIV seropositivity.<BR/>2.

<P>The abstracts of relevant conferences, including the International Conferences on AIDS, the Conferences on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections and the Interscience Conferences on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, as indexed by AIDSLINE, were also reviewed. All reference lists of all review articles and primary articles identified were searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Randomized controlled trials identified by the search were examined for inclusion in this review. The methodologic quality of each included study was assessed by two reviewers. Disagreements were discussed and resolved through consensus. Details of randomization, blinding and use of intention-to-treat analysis were recorded from published descriptions of the studies, and the number of patients lost to follow up was determined using standard guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>Results from the included studies were combined when treatment regimens were sufficiently similar (e.g., two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus one protease inhibitor versus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Because two of the studies had an uneven allocation between arms, it was determined to use a random effects model, generating a Peto odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Three were published (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK>, 1998; <LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK>, 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Reijers" TYPE="STUDY">Reijers</LINK>, 1998), and one was an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Clumeck" TYPE="STUDY">Clumeck</LINK>, 1999). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK> (1998) reported on AIDS Clinical Trials Group study 343, a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with 309 HIV-infected adults, conducted from August 1997 to January 5, 1998. Five hundred and nine adult patients with more than 200 CD4+ cells/ul and HIV RNA plasma viral load of more than 1000 copies/ml were enrolled to receive six months of induction therapy with indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine. No patients had previously been treated with protease inhibitors and 104 patients(20%) had more than 6 months of prior zidovudine treatment. Patients (n=309) who had completed the induction phase and had fewer than 200 copies/ml of HIV RNA at 16, 20 and 24 weeks of induction therapy were randomized to one of three arms: continued induction therapy, indinavir monotherapy and zidovudine plus lamivudine. The primary study end point was loss of viral suppression, defined as an increase in the level of plasma HIV RNA to at least 200 copies/ml. The study was terminated early due to significant differences in viral suppression among the three arms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK> (2002) reported the Trilege (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA 072) trial, an open-label randomized controlled trial with 279 HIV-infected adults, conducted from November 1996 to June 1998. Three hundred and seventy eight patients with no prior antiretroviral experience and more than 600 CD4+ cells/ul and HIV RNA of 3,500-100,000 copies/ml were enrolled to recieve three months of induction therapy with indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine. Patients (n=279) with fewer than 500 copies/ml after two months of therapy were randomized to one of three arms: continued induction therapy, zidovudine and indinavir, and zidovudine and lamivudine. The primary study end point was loss of viral suppression, defined as an increase in plasma HIV RNA to at least 500 copies/ml. The study was terminated early due to significant differences in viral suppression among the three arms. This meant no futher randomization after December 1997. The results here are of the final follow-up data at 18 months post randomization. The original Cochrane Review included interim results at one year of follow up time <LINK REF="STD-Rutherford" TYPE="STUDY">Rutherford</LINK> (2000).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reijers" TYPE="STUDY">Reijers</LINK> (1998) reported the Amsterdam Duration of Antiretroviral Medication (ADAM) study, an open-label randomized controlled trial with 31 HIV-infected, antiretroviral naive adults, conducted from March 1997 to April 6, 1998. Sixty two adult patients with a CD4+ count greater than 200 cells/ul and HIV RNA of at least 1000 copies/ml were enrolled to receive six months of induction therapy with stavudine, lamivudine, saquinivir and nelfinavir. Patients (n=31) with fewer than 50 copies/ml of HIV RNA at 24 and 25 weeks of therapy were randomized to one of three arms: continued induction therapy, stavudine and nelfinavir, and saquinivir and nelfinavir. The primary study end point was loss of viral suppression, defined as an increase in plasma HIV RNA to at least 400 copies/ml. The study was amended and subsequently terminated due to significant differences in viral suppression among the three arms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clumeck" TYPE="STUDY">Clumeck</LINK> (1999) reported the MIRO study, an open-label randomized controlled trial with 40 HIV-infected adults. Eighty five patients with greater than 100 CD4+ cells/ul and at least 5000 copies/ml of HIV RNA were enrolled to receive four months of induction therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and either indinavir or ritonavir plus saquinivir. All patients were protease inhibitor naive and 52 (61%) had been treated with a nucleoside reverse transcritase inhibitor. Patients (n=40) with fewer than 400 copies/ml of HIV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy were randomized to continue their protease inhibitor-containing initial therapy or to discontinue protease inhibitor therapy. The primary study end point was loss of viral suppression, defined as an increase in plasma HIV RNA to at least 400 copies/ml.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The ACTG 343 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK> 1998) used centralized randomization and therefore allocation was appropriately concealed (grade A). The trial was double blinded (grade A); all 309 randomized participants were followed until the end of the trial (grade A). All analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat approach (grade A).</P>
<P>The Trilege study (<LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK> 2002) did not explain how allocation was concealed (grade B). The study was open-label (grade B); all 279 randomized participants were followed until the completion of the trial (grade A). All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (grade A).</P>
<P>The ADAM study (<LINK REF="STD-Reijers" TYPE="STUDY">Reijers</LINK> 1998) did not explain how allocation was concealed (grade B). The study was open-label (grade B). The trial was terminated early after results from other studies became available and led to a premature analysis of the study and early termination of randomization. Twenty-five of the 31 randomized participants completed at least 26 weeks. Follow-up can be considered good because no one was lost to follow-up (grade A). </P>
<P>The MIRO abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Clumeck" TYPE="STUDY">Clumeck</LINK> 1999), did not give details of the randomization scheme (grade C). It was an open label study (grade B) and used intent-to-treat analysis (grade A). </P>
<P>All had objective baseline measurements and objective and reliable outcome measures.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>See: Table of comparisons</P>
<P>When all patients in the four trials were analyzed as a single group, the risk of loss of viral suppression was greater for those on the antiretroviral-sparing maintenance regimens: 116/324 antiretroviral-sparing regimen vs. 19/235 of those on prolonged induction (odds ratio [OR] 6.40, 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.73-10.98).</P>
<P>When performing the same analysis of published studies only (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK> 1998, <LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK> 2002, <LINK REF="STD-Reijers" TYPE="STUDY">Reijers</LINK> 1998), similar results were noted: 106/307 antiretroviral-sparing regimen vs. 15/212 prolonged induction (OR6.35, 95% CI, 3.56-11.34).</P>
<P>Combining the two studies that tested the same induction and antiretroviral-sparing maintenance therapies (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK> 1998, <LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK> 2002), the following results were noted:51/198 zidovudine and lamivudine vs. 14/197 prolonged induction with zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir (OR 4.58, 95% CI, 2.43-8.64).</P>
<P>When assessing maintenance regimens that discontinued one or more protease inhibitor after including them in the induction therapy, all four studies contributed results (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK> 1998, <LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK> 2002,<LINK REF="STD-Reijers" TYPE="STUDY">Reijers</LINK> 1998, <LINK REF="STD-Clumeck" TYPE="STUDY">Clumeck</LINK> 1999). The combined effect measure is in agreement with the earlier results: 84/222 without protease inhibitors vs. 19/235 prolonged induction including protease inhibitors (OR 7.92, 95% CI, 4.5 - 13.95).</P>
<P>Of the 1034 participants who originally entered the trials, only 663 (64%) were able to be randomized. Many patients were lost to follow up, some withdrew from the study due to drug intolerance, others continued to have elevated levels of viral load. Of the 663 participants who made it to the maintenance phase, 152 did not achieve sufficient viral suppression and 67 withdrew because of drug intolerance during initial treatment. The number that experienced drug side effects may in fact be higher since many patients withdrew but researchers in some cases did not report the reason for the withdrawl. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>All four studies strongly suggested that decreasing the numbers of antiretroviral drugs, and especially protease inhibitors, following successful induction therapy for HIV-1 is unsuccessful. The primary endpoint measured by all four studies was reappearance of plasma HIV RNA, an intermediate endpoint that presumably correlates with risk of clinical progression and death (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK>, 1998 and <LINK REF="STD-Flandre" TYPE="STUDY">Flandre</LINK>, 2002) used the same regimens (zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir versus zidovudine and lamivudine) allowing direct comparison. However, given the consistency of the findings across different regimens and different definitions of viral suppression, the evidence strongly indicates that drug-sparing maintenance regimens are not, at this time, a viable alternative in treatment for HIV infection. </P>
<P>The reasons for this likely lie in antiviral-resistant mutations. In ACTG 343 (<LINK REF="STD-Havlir" TYPE="STUDY">Havlir</LINK>, 1998), investigators examined the contribution of zidovudine-resistance-conferring mutations at codon 215 or 41 of the viral reverse transcriptase gene to failure of a zidovudine and lamivudine regimen using a multivariate model. Patients who had a zidovudine-resistant strain of HIV at randomization had odds of losing viral suppression of 27.2 compared to patients in the triple-drug arm at randomization (the odds of failure for patients with zidovudine-sensitive strains were 3.0).</P>
<P>Other endpoints that we wished to examine, including CD4+ counts, risk of AIDS and adherence to therapy, were variously reported. As a result, we were unable to assess these endpoints systematically.</P>
<P>The included studies pertain to induction regimens lasting 18 months. It is unknown whether a longer course of initial therapy followed by antiretroviral sparing maintenance regimen may be more successful, despite strong evidence that there is persistence of the virus even after up to three years of therapy. Thus, while the current evidence does not support drug-sparing maintenance regimens for HIV-1 infection, the problems of prolonged and even life-long therapy with complicated antiretroviral drug regimens remain. In an editorial accompanying two of the articles, Cooper (1998) makes a strong point that it would be "premature" to close off this line of inquiry. Alternative approaches for future research may include, in addition to longer induction, (a) achieving a lower nadir before switching to maintenance (500 copies/ml RNA of HIV is maybe too high) and (b) a more strict definition of viral suppression using other criteria (e.g., HIV DNA). Finally, it would be worthwhile considering alternative maintenance regimens beyond previously attempted.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Until better evidence is available, drug-sparing antiretroviral drug maintenance regimens after sucessful initial therapy, and especially those that discontinue of protease inhibitors, should be avoided.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>As outlined by Cooper(1998), despite the failure of these four trials to demonstrate that standard triple or quadruple antiretroviral drug induction regimens can be safely reduced, the need to find less complicated regimens with fewer potential drug interactions and fewer adherence difficulties remains. Futire studies may use longer, more potent initial therapy, alternating drugs, or beginning initial therapy much earlier in the course of infection. There is a Cochrane Review upcoming that will review recent trials that examine the question of first line anti-retroviral therapy with or without protease inhibitors. </P>
