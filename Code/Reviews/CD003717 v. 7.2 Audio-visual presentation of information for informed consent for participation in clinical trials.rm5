<P>The conclusions of this review are based on a much larger number of studies than the original version. While the updated review's findings were largely consistent with those of the previous version, we found some low to very low quality evidence of slight improvements in knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but with little or no difference in the effect on rate of participation or willingness to participate.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We ran new searches in June 2012. To the original 4 included studies we added 12 new studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 16.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria and some other aspects of the review methods were revised for this update. The original review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>) had only included people considering participating in a real trial. For this update, we included studies in which participants were asked to consider taking part in a real or a hypothetical clinical trial. We expanded the comparator interventions to include standard and placebo audio-visual interventions. We revised the structure of the outcomes, added several new outcomes and broadened the scope of the 'anxiety' outcome. We assessed all studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and added 'Summary of findings' tables.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:17:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of audio-visual presentation of information used in the informed consent process for people considering entering a clinical trial. We compared this with the usual informed consent information (either written and/or verbal) and placebo (sham) audio-visual information.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Before taking part in a clinical trial, potential participants must be provided with detailed information, such as what they will be asked to do and any possible benefits or harms. Once they understand what is involved, and if they are happy to take part, they usually sign a consent form. This process is known as 'informed consent'. The problem is that consent forms use technical language that can be hard to for the average person to understand. Sometimes people agree to take part in a clinical trial even though they are unsure what is involved. Presenting the consent form information in an audio-visual format (for example, on a computer or DVD) might improve the informed consent process.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies of audio-visual informed consent interventions which allocated people to an experimental or control group by a random or quasi-random process, published up until June 2012. We found 16 studies, involving a total of 1884 people. Nine studies included people considering real clinical trials, eight included people asked to imagine participating in a clinical trial (a hypothetical trial), with one including both. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States.</P>
<P>People were considering (or imagined considering) participation in a range of different clinical trials, including those testing cancer treatments and drugs for mental health problems. The audio-visual informed consent information was presented on computers, DVDs, videos and CD-ROMs. They included voice overs by professional actors, real patients talking about their experiences and a combination of words, pictures and audio to explain the technical concepts. In some studies, people also received the usual written informed consent forms and/or a face-to-face explanation by the study staff.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There is low to very low quality evidence that audio-visual consent interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. Audio-visual presentation may improve participation satisfaction with the information provided. However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear. There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent. There is conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions take more or less time to administer, and no study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use.</P>
<P>We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence from real clinical trials was low, and from hypothetical clinical studies, very low. This is because of the small number of people in the studies, and some issues in the way they were conducted. If the next update of this review includes more studies of audio-visual informed consent presentation, it could change the results of this review.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-18 10:57:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Informed consent is a critical component of clinical research. Different methods of presenting information to potential participants of clinical trials may improve the informed consent process. Audio-visual interventions (presented, for example, on the Internet or on DVD) are one such method. We updated a 2008 review of the effects of these interventions for informed consent for trial participation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-09 12:38:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>To assess the effects of audio-visual information interventions regarding informed consent compared with standard information or placebo audio-visual interventions regarding informed consent for potential clinical trial participants, in terms of their understanding, satisfaction, willingness to participate, and anxiety or other psychological distress.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-13 14:50:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, issue 6, 2012; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 June 2012); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1947 to 12 June 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to June week 1 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to 27 June 2012); Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 Week 27 to 2012 Week 26); and ERIC (Proquest) (searched 27 June 2012). We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles, and contacted study authors and experts. There were no language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-04-09 12:38:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing audio-visual information alone, or in conjunction with standard forms of information provision (such as written or verbal information), with standard forms of information provision or placebo audio-visual information, in the informed consent process for clinical trials. Trials involved individuals or their guardians asked to consider participating in a real or hypothetical clinical study. (In the earlier version of this review we only included studies evaluating informed consent interventions for real studies).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-05-07 16:05:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We synthesised the findings using meta-analysis, where possible, and narrative synthesis of results. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies and considered the impact of the quality of the overall evidence on the strength of the results.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:16:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We included 16 studies involving data from 1884 participants. Nine studies included participants considering real clinical trials, and eight included participants considering hypothetical clinical trials, with one including both. All studies were conducted in high-income countries.</P>
<P>There is still much uncertainty about the effect of audio-visual informed consent interventions on a range of patient outcomes. However, when considered across comparisons, we found low to very low quality evidence that such interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. Audio-visual presentation of informed consent may improve participant satisfaction with the consent information provided. However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent. We found conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions took more or less time to administer. No study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use.</P>
<P>The evidence from real clinical trials was rated as low quality for most outcomes, and for hypothetical studies, very low. We note, however, that this was in large part due to poor study reporting, the hypothetical nature of some studies and low participant numbers, rather than inconsistent results between studies or confirmed poor trial quality. We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 12:40:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The value of audio-visual interventions as a tool for helping to enhance the informed consent process for people considering participating in clinical trials remains largely unclear, although trends are emerging with regard to improvements in knowledge and satisfaction. Many relevant outcomes have not been evaluated in randomised trials. Triallists should continue to explore innovative methods of providing information to potential trial participants during the informed consent process, mindful of the range of outcomes that the intervention should be designed to achieve, and balancing the resource implications of intervention development and delivery against the purported benefits of any intervention.</P>
<P>More trials, adhering to CONSORT standards, and conducted in settings and populations underserved in this review, i.e. low- and middle-income countries and people with low literacy, would strengthen the results of this review and broaden its applicability. Assessing process measures, such as time taken to administer the intervention and researcher satisfaction, would inform the implementation of audio-visual consent materials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-14 15:08:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-14 15:08:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Informed consent is a critical stage in the conduct of clinical research. It is ethically imperative that potential trial participants are properly informed and understand that their initial and continuing participation is voluntary (<LINK REF="REF-Sugarman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugarman 1998</LINK>). Participants should be told of the aims of the research, the methods that are to be used, the anticipated benefits and potential harms of participation for them as individuals, any anticipated discomfort associated with participation, sources of funding, potential and actual conflicts of interest and the institutional affiliations of the researchers (<LINK REF="REF-WMA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WMA 2008</LINK>). In addition, potential participants should be informed of their right to refuse participation or withdraw their consent at any time, without affecting the care they receive. They should also be advised about any costs that they may incur, such as additional travel associated with attending hospital more often.</P>
<P>It is commonly reported that people who have given their 'informed consent' do not fully understand their rights as participants, or the methods of their treatment allocation in trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chuppay-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuppay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hietanen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hietanen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). Terminology used in the consent process for trials may be challenging, with concepts such as randomisation, blinding of treatment allocation and equipoise (a state of genuine uncertainty as to the potential benefits and harms of interventions in the trial) needing to be conveyed. Misconceptions about the purpose of a trial and the treatment that will be received are common (<LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2001a</LINK>), and a significant proportion of people do not recall consenting to participation on their own or their child's behalf (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chappuy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappuy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schats-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schats 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tait-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tait 2003</LINK>). Despite the imperative for the informed consent process to meet regulatory guidelines for clinical research, poor participant understanding of the research has been demonstrated across clinical areas (<LINK REF="REF-Chuppay-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuppay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). As a result there have been calls for research into innovations to improve the informed consent process for clinical research (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tait-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tait 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>).</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-09 12:51:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Different strategies have been tried to improve the informed consent process. These include written information materials and consent forms modified with simple language, added illustrations, and altered layout to highlight important points (<LINK REF="REF-Enama-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enama 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruse 2000</LINK>). Other studies have included additional detailed oral and/or written information (<LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1998</LINK>) and computer-based enhancement of information provision (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2001a</LINK>) in attempts to improve the process. The use of audio-visual interventions such as informational DVDs and computer presentations may enhance the process. Audio-visual presentations can ensure the clear delivery of information that is complete, consistent and unbiased, to supplement or reduce staff time spent in seeking informed consent. A study of the feasibility of using multimedia technology during the informed consent process for clinical research reported that consumers felt the multimedia tool allowed them to control the pace at which they viewed the information, and that the use of the video "made information more understandable" (<LINK REF="STD-Jimison-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jimison 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using a visual format to present information on clinical research may complement the informed consent process and audio-visual presentation may be used to provide a dramatic representation of what participation in the study involves. In addition, complex concepts such as randomisation may be explained using visual examples. An audio-visual format may also enable subgroups of potential research participants, such as those who have difficulty reading complex information, to access and better understand complex concepts (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>). Audio-visual information presented via the Internet, computer or DVD may promote interactivity, with viewers being able to access specific information, or lay definitions of terms, via interactive menus.</P>
<P>Despite the potential benefits of using audio-visual interventions in the informed consent process, harms may also be associated with their use. In many situations, such as in cancer trials or where parents' consent is sought for a child's participation, informed consent is associated with difficult treatment decisions (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruccione-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruccione 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stryker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stryker 2006</LINK>). Such situations may be inherently distressing, and the information disclosed in the informed consent process may increase people's anxiety or sense of powerlessness (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruccione-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruccione 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2001</LINK>). People's satisfaction with the informed consent process and with their decision about participating in the research, and their level of decisional regret may also be affected (<LINK REF="REF-Franck-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franck 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupst 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pope-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stryker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stryker 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>With informed consent for trial participation, as for screening and treatment decisions, there is tension between ensuring consumers are informed and ensuring participation (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raffle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raffle 2001</LINK>). In other health arenas, enhancing the structure and content of healthcare information has led to consumers adopting more conservative screening or treatment choices (<LINK REF="REF-Stacey-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacey 2014</LINK>). The effect of audio-visual interventions for informed consent on outcomes such as rates of trial participation and willingness to participate is important in this context. For individuals, trial participation may be a benefit or a harm, depending on the trial and its particular risks and benefits to them, as well as on their understanding of these underlying risks and benefits. Triallists seeking ethically to provide high-quality evidence in order to genuinely benefit society through improved healthcare policy and practice have a legitimate interest in promoting trial participation; while in the context of poorly or unethically-conducted trials, willingness to participate should be considered a harm. In this review we considered it important to capture the audio-visual intervention's effects on people's decision or willingness to participate in the subsequent trial. We emphasise, however, that these outcomes may be either beneficial or harmful to participants and should be considered in the context of the particular trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hypothetical trials</HEADING>
<P>In this review update we newly included hypothetical clinical trials. These are trials in which the participants may be healthy volunteers or people with a health condition who are asked to consider taking part in an imaginary clinical trial. Hypothetical trials may allow greater internal validity than clinical trials, for example they are not necessarily constrained by the same inclusion and exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>) and they allow for pre-testing of novel consent formats without adversely affecting a real clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Llewellyn_x002d_Thomas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Llewellyn-Thomas 1995</LINK>). However, they are considered to reduce external validity, as participants may not make the same choices in a real-world as in a hypothetical situation. We include these trials in this update for two reasons. First, hypothetical trials of audio-visual information in informed consent continue to be conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>) and second, there has been limited systematic comparison of the value of hypothetical trials in this area. Our inclusion of hypothetical trials allows for such a comparison, albeit informally.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Terminology</HEADING>
<P>This review uses the terms 'clinical trial' and 'clinical research' interchangeably. In the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>), these terms were not defined explicitly but both referred to randomised controlled trials of healthcare interventions. However as clinical and informed consent research have grown, it is necessary to define our use of these terms. A clinical trial is usually described as one kind of clinical research, but the explicit differences between the terms are poorly defined. Research into screening tests, diagnostic procedures, the natural history of disease, in addition to healthcare treatments or interventions have all been described as both clinical research and a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC_x002c_-ARC-and-AVCC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC, ARC and AVCC 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2012</LINK>). Yet, the definition of a clinical trial tends to refer to a trial of health-related interventions, and is often proceeded by a description of the four phases of a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK> refers to clinical research as including drug, surgical and behavioural treatments, cells and other biological products, radiologic procedures, devices, process of care changes and preventative care. In this review we use the two terms interchangeably to mean a clinical research study involving humans who are prospectively assigned to receive a healthcare intervention, including treatments, or diagnostic or monitoring procedures and devices.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Relationship to other relevant reviews</HEADING>
<P>This review relates to a number of Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews. Four recent systematic reviews have focused on aspects of the informed consent process for clinical trial participation, and are directly relevant to this review (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 2013</LINK>). Recently, <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK> systematically reviewed the effects of multimedia informed consent interventions on knowledge, identifying 20 studies. The authors used a broad definition of a multimedia intervention as one in which the information was 'computer-based', and considered knowledge as their sole outcome. This review also focused on the degree to which the interventions were underpinned by theoretical concepts. The three other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 2013</LINK>) have also considered the effects of multimedia informed consent interventions within systematic reviews that also include other kinds of enhanced consent interventions, such as simplified written materials. <LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 2013</LINK> identified 13 trials of video and computer multimedia interventions and considered their effects on understanding, satisfaction, accrual and retention. <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK> identified 12 video and multimedia interventions assessed in 9 studies. In addition to the effect of the intervention on understanding, they also considered participant satisfaction and willingness to participate. Despite the fact that <LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2007</LINK> was conducted after <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>, its authors found only two studies that assessed multimedia consent interventions, and only considered the effect on knowledge.</P>
<P>A recent Cochrane review by Kinnersley and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK>), examining interventions to promote informed consent for people considering treatment decisions, such as surgery, is complementary to this review. They identified 25 studies that assessed non-interactive audio-visual or interactive multimedia interventions, allowing a pooled analysis of these interventions' effects on knowledge, satisfaction and anxiety. Another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Treweek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treweek 2010</LINK>) considered the effects of interventions to improve recruitment to randomised controlled trials, finding three trials of educational video interventions.</P>

<P>For the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>), we searched in April 2004 and updated searches in June 2006. Due to changes in the review's inclusion criteria (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>), and in relevant terminology, we revised these strategies and ran them in June 2012 (see <LINK TAG="APPENDICES" TYPE="SECTION">Appendices</LINK> 1 to 7). We did not limit the latest searches by year of publication, to ensure all references were screened according to the review's amended inclusion criteria. The search strategies for the previous version of this review are not reported here as they have been replaced by the 2012 search strategies; however they can be viewed in <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-09 13:00:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We assessed and reported on the methodological characteristics of included studies in accordance with the guidelines of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, which recommends using the Cochrane &#8216;Risk of Bias&#8217; tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>; see also <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2013</LINK>). The &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; tool includes seven domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias.  Under 'other sources of bias' we examined baseline imbalance between groups, inappropriate administration of an intervention and contamination between intervention and control groups. We judged each item as being at &#8216;high&#8217;, &#8216;low&#8217; or &#8216;unclear&#8217; risk of bias, as set out in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the sequence generation domain, we rated quasi-randomised studies as 'high risk'. For the blinding of outcome assessors we considered the type of outcome (objective or self-reported); and the role of the participants in measuring the outcome and/or the providers of the outcome assessment measure (i.e. self-administered questionnaire or provider-administered interview). For objective outcome measures, blinding of the participants was not judged as key to the 'Risk of bias' assessment. Studies were judged to be at a low risk of bias if personnel were blinded; and at an unclear risk of bias if they were not, or it was unclear.</P>
<P>For self-reported outcomes, which comprised the majority of outcomes in the review, we considered whether outcomes were self-administered or personnel-administered. For self-administered outcomes, blinding of personnel was not judged as key to the 'Risk of bias' assessment.  Studies were judged at low risk of bias if participants were blinded, high if they were unblinded and low if it was unclear.  For self-reported outcomes that were personnel-administered, we considered both the blinding of participants and personnel.  Studies in which both personnel and participants were blinded were judged at low risk or bias and studies in which both personnel and participants were unblinded were judged at high risk of bias.  If either the personnel or participants were unblinded it was judged at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Two authors (AS/DF/BP/RR/MP) independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies, with any disagreements resolved by discussion and consensus. Where possible we contacted study authors for clarification of the study methods (see <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>). We incorporated the results of the 'Risk of bias' assessment into the review through standard tables (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) and systematic narrative description and commentary about each of the elements, leading to an overall assessment the risk of bias of included studies and a judgement about the internal validity of the review&#8217;s<B> </B>results, at the outcome level where possible.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-04-09 13:00:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we sought to analyse data based on the number of events and the number of people assessed in the intervention and comparison groups, presenting the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous measures, we sought to analyse data based on the mean, standard deviation (SD) and number of people assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups, presenting the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. Where meta-analysis of continuous data was possible, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI as the studies used different tools for the same outcome. Where there were insufficient data provided to present the results in this way (for example the total number of participants in the intervention and control groups not provided), we report the data as presented by the authors.</P>
<P>Some of our outcomes are outcome categories, whereby a single study may contribute multiple outcomes to a category.  An example of this is the knowledge and understanding outcome.  If a study had multiple outcomes in the same category, we identified the main outcome for the study using the following approach (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 2009</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selecting the primary outcome as identified by the publication authors;</LI>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 13:01:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>In the event that studies collected outcome measures more than once, for example, measuring intention to participate immediately after the intervention and some weeks later, we took the longest follow up time point from each study.  In the case of the 'knowledge' outcome however, we report two separate outcome measures: 'knowledge', and 'recall of knowledge at least two weeks later'. The 'knowledge' outcome was taken as the knowledge measured in the period immediately after delivery of the intervention.  If knowledge was measured more than once (i.e. at two weeks and at three months), we took the longer follow-up measurement for the 'recall of knowledge' outcome measure.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-04-09 13:02:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>In the case of missing outcome data, missing summary data or missing study-level participant characteristics, we contacted the authors for more information. Where this was provided, we included the data in the review. We report any data that were not provided, identified this as a source of bias and considered its implications in interpreting the results. We imputed missing summary data where possible and report any assumptions made.</P>

We were not able to combine sufficient RCTs (at least 10) to construct a funnel plot to investigate small study effects or publication bias. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-09-04 11:43:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To synthesise the results, we reviewed the interventions and comparisons in each study and used this to create our overarching comparisons for the review. Keeping the real and hypothetical studies separate, we report the available data for each of our primary and secondary outcomes within each comparison. Where possible, we pooled the data meta-analytically. We describe the results for each outcome narratively and, where there were sufficient data, graphically. For each outcome we considered the impact of the quality of the evidence on the strength of the result, the degree of heterogeneity and its possible sources and the relevance of the results to research practice. We used the GRADE system (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>) to determine the quality of the evidence using <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro</LINK> software.</P>
<P>The decision to meta-analyse the data was based on an assessment of whether the included trials were similar enough (in terms of comparisons, interventions and outcomes) to enable meaningful conclusions to be drawn from a statistically-pooled result. It was also dependent on there being data from two or more primary studies available for inclusion. We did not take into account the similarity of study populations in the decision to meta-analyse the data, as we were seeking to determine the effect of the intervention across populations. However, we considered the study population as a possible source of heterogeneity in the pooled result.  Due to the variability in the populations and interventions of included studies, we used a random-effects model for all meta-analyses. </P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 13:03:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Due to a lack of studies, we did not conduct the planned subgroup analyses on participants' education level and literacy. In future updates of the review, if sufficient data are available, we will investigate potential differences between particular subsets of participants visually (for example by using box plots), and then by subgroup analyses or, if the number of trials permit (i.e. greater than 10), by using random-effects meta-regression. The latter will be preferred because it will allow us to estimate the relative change and 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS>
<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 13:04:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>There were insufficient studies to conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of the included studies' risk of bias on effect estimates obtained from meta-analyses. If sufficient studies are available in future updates, we plan to group studies according to their 'Risk of bias' ratings (high/unclear risk of bias or low risk of bias). A study will be categorised as being at high/unclear risk of bias if it was rated as being at high or unclear risk of bias on one or more of the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment or selective outcome reporting. The remaining studies will be considered at low risk of bias. These three domains were selected as the limited but growing empirical evidence from methodological studies suggests they can most strongly influence intervention effect estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>), although these decisions may be revised in light of most recent methodological advice. We will exclude studies at high/unclear risk of bias in a sensitivity analysis to determine whether risk of bias has substantially influenced review findings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Consumer participation</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we collected information (from the trial report and from author contact where possible) about the involvement of consumers in the development and evaluation of the interventions. We also sought literature on consumers' views of informed consent for clinical studies, and their needs from the informed consent process. This literature helped to inform the review, particularly the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>, and the <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>. In addition, consumer advocates assessed the protocol (<LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 2002</LINK>), and the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>), to ensure that consumers' needs and views were represented appropriately.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Eight of the nine real clinical trial studies were described as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK>) but in three of these studies the random sequence generation method was not fully described, so they may be quasi-RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK>). The ninth study (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>) was a quasi-RCT which allocated participants sequentially.</P>
<P>Seven of the eight hypothetical clinical trial studies were described as RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>), but four of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>) did not fully describe their random sequence generation method so they could be quasi-RCTs. <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK> was a quasi-RCT, sequentially allocating participants to groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Studies ranged in size from 35 (<LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) to 441 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>); in total 2330 people participated in the 16 studies.</P>
<P>We excluded some participants from three studies as they did not meet our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK> - see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We also excluded participants in additional study arms that did not meet our inclusion criteria, or we could not be sure the study arm met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> - see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, we included data from 1884 participants in this review; 1023 participants considering real clinical trial studies and 861 participants considering hypothetical clinical trial studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Twelve of the 16 studies were conducted in the United States, with 2 of the real clinical trial studies being conducted in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>) and 1 in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>). The sole hypothetical clinical trial study conducted outside of the United States was <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>, undertaken in Australia.</P>
<P>The studies were predominantly conducted in hospitals/medical centres (where specified). Of the real clinical trials, <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK> was conducted in both a health centre and university. Of the hypothetical clinical trial studies, <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> was conducted in a community facility.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>While the participants were diverse across the 16 studies, half of the studies focused on cancer drug trials or psychiatric treatments (predominantly medications). Most of the people considering real trial participation had cancer and were considering participation in one of multiple phase I to III oncology trials being offered (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK>) included people with psychiatric disorders (predominantly schizophrenia) considering one of many trials of psychiatric treatments (predominantly medication). <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK> included pregnant women considering a trial for the management of pre-labour rupture of membranes (PROM) at term. <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK> did not specify the study inclusion criteria but participants were considering a clinical trial of a duodenal ulcer drug.</P>
<P>The hypothetical clinical trials included nominally 'well people' (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>), people with a health condition (<LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) or both populations (<LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> also created two population groups by using two different hypothetical studies (high risk and low risk study protocol) on which to base their consent materials. We included the data from both population groups in all three studies. Participants with actual health conditions had Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK> were the only studies to include guardians (parents imagining clinical trial participation for their children).</P>
<P>In all studies, it was either explicitly stated, or implied, that the interventions were conducted in English. Half the trials specified English competency in their inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>) specifically sampled for people with low health literacy, by conducting the study in a low-income community.</P>
<P>Of all studies in which ethnicity was reported, four included less than 15% of participants from ethnic minorities (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>) while three studies had between 22% and 32% of participants from ethnic minorities (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>). The education level of participants across the studies was generally high (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Despite the focus of this review on studies that include just one kind of informed consent intervention (audio-visual), there was considerable heterogeneity between both the interventions and comparisons in this review. Across studies, the interventions varied widely in terms of the format, content and interactivity of the audio-visual component and the presence of additional elements such as written materials or face-to-face discussion. So too the control groups varied between written materials, face-to-face interaction and placebo audio-visual presentation, either alone or in combination.</P>
<P>Based on the interventions and control groups included in the studies, three comparisons were possible:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Audio-visual informed consent interventions versus standard informed consent procedures</LI>
<LI>Audio-visual plus standard informed consent interventions versus standard informed consent procedures</LI>
<LI>Audio-visual informed consent interventions versus placebo audio-visual interventions</LI>
</OL>
<P>We provide a description of the interventions and control groups of the studies included in each of these comparisons.</P>
<P>While the majority of studies included two arms, providing a single comparison, there were a number of studies with more than two arms. For the real clinical trials, we pooled the two intervention arms in <LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK> (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>), in line with <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>) as we could determine very little difference between the intervention components. For the same reasons, we pooled the two intervention arms in the hypothetical studies <LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We elected not to pool the intervention arms in <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK> as the differences in the intervention components and results were more stark.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison 1: Audio-visual informed consent interventions versus standard informed consent interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two real clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>) and seven hypothetical clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) compared an audio-visual informed consent intervention with a standard informed consent intervention. The studies within this comparison either made the simple comparison of audio-visual intervention versus written information or the more complex comparison of audio-visual + face-to-face intervention versus written information + face to face intervention. Because the face-to-face component in the more complex comparison is present in the both the intervention and control groups, it is effectively controlled for in the analysis. Thus, the underlying comparison in both the simple and complex comparisons in the same, namely an audio-visual informed consent intervention versus a standard informed consent intervention.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Single intervention (audio-visual intervention alone versus written information)</HEADING>
<P>One real (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>) and four hypothetical clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK>) compared a single audio-visual intervention with written consent information.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Real clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The audio-visual interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK> consisted of a computer and video program. Little information is provided about the format of each, other than the fact both had scripts (implying there was audio) and the video used actors. Both interventions were non-interactive, were delivered by a research assistant on site and took between 10 and 20 minutes to view. The audio-visual interventions were professionally produced but it is unclear whether their development was informed by relevant theory or user testing. The pooled audio-visual arms were compared to a written consent form. It is unclear whether participants read the form independently or were guided through it. The content of both the audio-visual intervention and written forms was based on 1 of 18 specific consent forms and included the standard elements of a consent document (for example purpose, risks, participant rights) and was written at 8th-grade level.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hypothetical clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The audio-visual interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK> consisted of a computer and video program (as described above).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> included video and computer interventions. These were almost identical except that the video had no text (no reading required) and was not interactive while the computer program had bulleted text and participants could advance the slides. Both interventions had video and still pictures with narration. The intervention was self-directed and the entire intervention took around one hour to complete. Minimal information about the interventions' development was provided beyond that they were based on readability research. For the purposes of the analysis, we pooled the results of the two intervention groups together. The intervention was compared with a written consent form. Two different consent forms were used (for a low risk and high risk study). The basic content for both consent forms and all intervention groups included standard consent information about one of the two trials, using simplified language.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK> the audio-visual intervention was a computer program. It used text and hyperlinks to key words and diagrams, video clips of procedures and online quizzes. The intervention was interactive and took on average 19 minutes to complete. The program encouraged participants to re-read sections when they incorrectly answered quiz questions. The development and theory behind the computer program was not reported. It was compared to a paper-based consent form. The content of both presentations was identical and covered standard consent information.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Lonergan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">O'Lonergan 2011</LINK> used a computer-based intervention. It was shown as a PowerPoint slide with embedded hyperlinks to video clips showing footage of the procedures. The interaction was interactive, was delivered to the parent-child dyad together and took from 7 to 10 minutes to complete. The audio-visual intervention was informed by relevant theory (learning-objective approach) and extensive user testing with parents and children. The control group received the standard written consent form. The content of both consent materials covered standard consent concepts.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Real clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The audio-visual intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK> consisted of a computer program which was followed by a discussion with an oncologist. The program consisted of written and narrated information, with video clips of actors portraying patients making decisions about trial participation. It was self-directed and interactive, and about 20 minutes long. The computer program was based on extensive consultation with patients and other stakeholder groups, but no theoretical basis is described. The intervention was compared to the standard National Cancer Institute (NCI) consent form and a discussion with an oncologist. The content of both arms was based on the NCI Clinical Trials Pamphlet (including phases of drug testing and the voluntary nature of participation) about clinical trials in general.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hypothetical clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The audio-visual intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK> was a web-based multimedia intervention delivered with face-to-face guidance and clarification from a research assistant. The intervention used a mix of video clips, static images/graphics and bulleted text. Questions were included at the end of each section; the length was not reported. The intervention was delivered by the research assistant, who participants could ask to pause and replay sections. The development and theoretical basis for the intervention is not described but the authors refer to using the same hypothetical protocol as their previous study (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>). This was compared with a standard written consent form plus face-to-face guidance and clarification from a research assistant. The content was identical in both groups, and included standard consent information for a specific trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK> used two audio-visual presentations (multimedia and interactive multimedia) combined with a researcher available to answer questions. Both presentations used text, graphics and narration of text, and could be stopped and resumed. In the interactive multimedia arm, participants could also advance the screen and replay content and had to answer questions correctly to progress. These took about 20 minutes to complete. The authors described a strong theoretical basis but development of the interventions was otherwise not described. These arms were compared to a standard consent document that was read out by a research assistant. The content was identical in all groups and based on standard consent documents.</P>
<P>The audio-visual intervention used in <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK> consisted of a computer slide show along with a research assistant highlighting the key points. The slide show consisted of graphics, narration and video clips and took on average 25 minutes to complete. It was only interactive in the sense that the research assistant advanced the slides. The content described standard informed consent information and was identical to the written information to which it was compared.

<P>Five real clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>) and no hypothetical clinical trials compared audio-visual plus standard informed consent interventions with standard informed consent interventions. The interventions and comparisons in these studies differ from comparison 1 in that the interventions and control groups received identical consent materials, with the exception of the addition of the audio-visual materials in the intervention group. Thus the underlying comparison becomes audio-visual intervention versus no intervention (as the additional materials are controlled in both groups). These studies made the following comparisons:</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK> had two audio-visual intervention arms that consisted of non-interactive videos and both were supplemented by information provided by a researcher. Limited information is provided about how the videos differed, but both appeared to contain footage of research staff describing the parent studies. Both were developed 'in house' by the research team. No theoretical basis is described. The content is described as the 'usual' information provided about clinical trials. The length of the audio-visual interventions is unclear. Due to the similarities between the intervention groups these results were pooled for the analysis. The pooled interventions were compared to the 'unassisted disclosure' group, in which subjects received the consent information (exact content unclear) from a researcher in a 'customary' manner. It is unclear if either the intervention or control groups included written information.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK> the intervention group received a DVD presentation plus the written consent form. The DVD was non-interactive and consisted of footage of clinical trial participants and healthcare providers providing unscripted perspectives on trial participation. Participants were given the 20-minute DVD to watch at home. The authors describe an extensive development process involving multi-disciplinary stakeholder groups including consumers. This was compared with the written consent form that participants also took home to read. The content of the written consent form was not stated, but it is implied that it covered standard consent form topics.</P>
<P>Participants in intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK> initially met with a doctor and received the written consent form for 1 of 18 trials for which they were eligible, then took the audio-visual presentation home with them. They returned a week later to discuss their trial participation with the doctor. The audio-visual presentation could be viewed on a DVD, CD-ROM or video, was non-interactive and took 10 minutes to watch. It covered general information about clinical trials (including randomisation, voluntariness, benefits/risks) and video of participants undergoing treatment. The audio-visual materials were overseen by an advisory committee and expert consumer panel. This was compared with control participants who also received the same components (minus the audio-visual intervention). The written consent form contained the same information as the audio-visual presentation but was more specific to the trial itself.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK> the intervention group received a written consent form and had a discussion with a study nurse, followed by viewing the audio-visual presentation (in the form of a video). The video included information on the study protocol, procedures used and possible adverse reactions. Being a video, it is unlikely to have been interactive and the length is unspecified. The development and any theoretical basis are unclear. This was compared with the control group participants who received the written consent form and discussion with the study nurse.</P>
<P>Participants in the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK> viewed a 10-minute, non-interactive video and then received the written consent form and had any questions answered by a study nurse. Participants could watch the video at home or on site (most chose on site). The video was narrated by the principal investigator and discussed standard elements of informed consent and showed video footage of actual patients receiving the treatment. It was developed by a professional production company. No theoretical basis is described. This was compared to participants in the control group who received the written consent form and had any questions answered by the study nurse.</P>

<P>Two real clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK>) and one hypothetical clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>) compared an audio-visual informed consent intervention with a placebo audio-visual informed consent intervention. Both <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK> compared an audio-visual intervention with a placebo intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK> compared an audio visual + face-to-face intervention with a placebo DVD + face-to-face intervention. Because the face-to-face components in <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK> are present in both the intervention and control groups, they effectively cancel each other out for the purposes of the analysis. Thus, the underlying comparison in the three studies is audio-visual informed consent intervention versus placebo audio-visual informed consent intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Real clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK> used a non-interactive DVD presentation covering standard informed consent topics. It was created in a documentary style, with graphics and text to augment the dialogue and enacted scenes. It was eight minutes long and delivered on site in a private room. The information was not specific to a single trial. The DVD was informed by an understanding of common knowledge deficits for potential trial participants and reviewed by oncologists. No theoretical basis was described. This was compared with a placebo DVD that covered general information about the accomplishments of the researchers. No clinical trial specific content was included. Participants then consulted a doctor to discuss their trial participation but the outcomes were measured before this appointment, so there was no face-to-face element to the intervention when considering the outcomes measured.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK> the audio-visual presentation consisted of a video covering standard consent information plus a discussion about good decision-making. The information was not specific to a single trial but about research in general. The video was 16 minutes long, non-interactive and consisted of bulleted text, narration and brief vignettes with actors playing study staff and patients discussing participation. The development and any theoretical basis were not described.This was compared to a control group which received a placebo video. This contained information about the history of research with no clinical trial specific information. Both <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK> do not explicitly state that participants received a copy of the written consent form with the DVD or placebo DVD, but it would seem likely that they did at some point, as they were making a decision about participation in one of several real clinical trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hypothetical clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK> consisted of a DVD, a copy of the written consent form and face-to-face explanation from a researcher. The DVD content was based on the consent form and included standard informed consent information. It was interactive, in that participants could ask the research assistant to stop and repeat sections, and contained narration, still pictures, graphics and animation, and summary text. Participants could also ask the researcher questions. On average, it took 22 minutes to complete. The authors report that the intervention drew heavily on multimedia learning theory, but gave no further information about its development. This was compared with a placebo DVD that contained 'general research information' and the written consent form that participants could read along with the researcher.</P>

The QuiC (used in <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>) has two component scores; objective knowledge and self-reported knowledge. As the authors identified the objective knowledge component as their primary outcome, we extracted and report on this measure in the review. <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK> asked participants nine separate knowledge-related questions. Three of these questions had more than one correct response and could not be included. We ranked the effect estimates of the remaining six questions and selected the median: knowledge of goals of clinical trials - safety. Additionally, the results of the knowledge questionnaire in <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK> were reported as the percentage of participants who scored between 0 and 10 questions correct.

<P>Four hypothetical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) measured multiple knowledge outcomes. In addition to measuring 'prompted recall', <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK> also assessed 'free recall', whereby participants were asked to describe all they could remember about the study and then were scored on how many pieces of information they recalled. Because prompted recall was measured in a way that was consistent with other studies (by questionnaire), we selected and extracted data for this outcome measure. The MacCAT-CR (used by <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) measures three sub-scales that all met our criteria for knowledge and understanding: 1) understanding, 2) appreciation and 3) reasoning. These were measured immediately after the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>), again after re-explanation of initially-misunderstood information (<LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) and once again after a second re-explanation (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK> reported the three relevant sub-scales at one time point. As such, we calculated the effect size between groups for each sub-scale, ranked them and used the median effect size in our review. This was the 'reasoning' sub-scale for both the people with schizophrenia and the healthy comparison participants. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>, all sub-scales were presented at both time points. As a result we took the longest time point (after re-explanation of consent information) and ranked the effect estimates. The median effect estimate was the understanding sub-scale, so this was used as the knowledge outcome measure. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>, only one sub-scale (understanding) was presented at all three time points. It was unclear at which time point the other two sub-scales were taken. As a result, we could not rank the effect estimates and instead took the longest time point (after two re-explanations of the consent information) for the understanding sub-scale and used this as the knowledge outcome measure. By taking the longest time point it means the intervention effectively includes more face-to-face exposure, however participants in this trial already received significant input from a research assistant (to answer questions etc) so this does not change the components of the intervention in a meaningful way.</P>

We ranked the effect estimates and selected the median: whether the intervention helped in deciding whether or not to participate in a clinical trial (and reported the percentage of those who agreed or strongly agreed). This was assessed once immediately after the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK> asked participants to rate their satisfaction with the quality of the consent procedure relative to past experience using a three-point Likert scale. However, this question was only asked of participants who had taken part in previous research (approximately 80% of participants). This was assessed once immediately after the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK> included three questions to measure satisfaction on a five-point Likert scale (satisfaction with consent length, difficulty and importance of the information).

Data from <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK> could not be included as the authors sought participant feedback after the completion of the RCT portion of their study, inviting control participants to also view the video and provide their perceptions. <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK> used qualitative methods to explore participant perceptions, which was not included in this review.</P>

We took the second measure (entry into the trial) as it was a more concrete measure of participation. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK> all measured this outcome once, within approximately one week of the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK> measured willingness for future trial participation immediately after the intervention and two to four weeks later.

<P>Overall, studies were judged to be at moderate to high risk of bias (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Many studies provided insufficient information about study design and execution, and hence were judged as unclear for a number of domains. This may be a reflection of inadequate reporting rather than poor conduct of the trials themselves. Risk of bias was highest in the domain of blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), reflecting the difficulty of achieving blinding in studies of information provision. Studies fared better with regard to completeness of outcome data (attrition bias) and other sources of bias, with more than half the included studies rated as low risk for these domains.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>The overt nature of audio-visual interventions makes blinding of participants and providers particularly difficult, unless a placebo audio-visual intervention is used. As such, the majority of real clinical trials and all hypothetical clinical trials were ranked as being at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel.</P>
<P>Two real trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>) were able to blind or partially blind participants and personnel (low risk). <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK> used a placebo DVD (making blinding possible), but provided insufficient information about blinding (unclear risk). <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK> blinded personnel, but not participants (unclear risk).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>Similarly, the nature of the outcomes measured in informed consent trials limits investigators' ability to blind the outcome assessment. The majority of outcomes (such as knowledge and satisfaction) are self-reported, making blinding difficult when participants are not themselves blind to their allocation. In fact, the only outcome included in this review able to be measured objectively (by case notes, for example) is rate of participation in the parent trial. In determining the risk of detection bias for each study, we considered whether the outcome was objective or self-reported, and the role of participants and personnel in administering the outcome measure. For studies with more than one outcome we rated the risk of bias for each outcome before combining the ratings.</P>
<P>Only one of the nine real studies (<LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK>) was judged to be at low risk of bias for blinded outcome assessment; the outcomes were self-reported but participants were blind to group allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK> was judged at low risk of bias for the objective primary outcome (rate of participation) but at unclear risk of bias overall when considering the remainder of self-reported outcomes. A further two real trials were at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient information about how the outcomes were assessed and by whom (<LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK>), and whether personnel conducting interviews with participants were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>), while the remaining five studies were at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Based on the evidence from real clinical trials, we are uncertain about the effect of a single audio-visual intervention (versus written information) on participant knowledge and understanding of the parent study.

While the difference between the intervention and control group answers in 4 out of 5 response options was not statistically significant, the authors reported that participants "in the intervention group were significantly more likely to correctly state that the purpose of an early phase trial related to safety (34.4%) compared to 16% of control participants (P = 0.03)".</P>
<P>Based on the evidence from real clinical trials, we are uncertain about the effect of a multi-component audio-visual intervention (versus written information) on participant knowledge and understanding of the parent study.

The pooled result showed no effect on knowledge (SMD 0.24 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.71)) with low statistical heterogeneity (Chi² = 0.25, P = 0.88, I² = 0%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (sub-analysis 1.1.3)).

We were unable to include the results of <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK> in the meta-analysis as the authors did not state the overall number of participants in each group. <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK> reported a statistically-significant improvement in understanding with the interactive multimedia intervention (mean number of correct responses 15.9/18, SD 0.93) compared with the control group (mean number of correct responses 14.9/18, SD 1.34) (P &lt; 0.05), but not between the non-interactive multimedia intervention and control (mean number of correct responses (15.2/18, SD 1.51).</P>
<P>Based on the evidence from hypothetical clinical trials, we are uncertain about the effect of a multi-component audio-visual intervention (versus written information). While all studies showed a consistent improvement in knowledge, none reached statistical significance (unlikely due to their small sample sizes). In addition, the quality of the evidence was very low (very serious risk of bias limitations; small, hypothetical studies suggesting indirectness; confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect and clinically important benefit but not harm) meaning these effect sizes are very uncertain.</P>

For the continuous data, we pooled the results of the two audio-visual intervention groups in <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK> and meta-analysed this with the results of <LINK REF="STD-Hoffner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffner 2012</LINK>. We did not include <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK> in this meta-analysis as the data appeared to be skewed on inspection of the box and whiskers plot. The combined result showed evidence of no effect on knowledge (SMD 0.04 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.38) (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Statistical heterogeneity was low (Chi² = 0.60, P = 0.44, I² = 0%). <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK> compared the difference in the change in percentage knowledge score and the difference in median knowledge change scores between groups and found that knowledge scores in the intervention group were higher. The authors reported that the percentage mean change favoured the intervention group (P &gt; 0.05) and the median knowledge change score between groups was 5.0 (95% CI 0.0 to 16.7).</P>
<P>For the dichotomous data, <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK> measured the percentage of participants scoring at least 80% on their knowledge questionnaire. We dichotomised the categorical results of <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK> into this same format to allow for statistical comparison. Due to high statistical heterogeneity (Chi² = 67.75, P &lt; 0.001, I² = 99%) we have presented the results graphically without the pooled result (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Considered separately, <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1990</LINK> found that participants in the intervention group had greater knowledge that those in the control group (82/100 versus 30/100, RR 2.73 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.74)), whereas <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK> demonstrated evidence of no effect, with a result that included no clinically important benefit or harm (using the 'rule of thumb' for dichotomous outcomes of an effect size of 0.25) (40/42 versus 42/48, RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.24)).</P>
<P>Based on the evidence from real clinical trials, we are uncertain about the effect of audio-visual plus standard interventions (versus standard information) on knowledge and understanding of the parent study.

Due to moderate statistical heterogeneity when we attempted to pool the results (P = 0.08, I² = 68%), we present these results separately (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Neither study found evidence of an effect of audio-visual interventions on rate of participation (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>: 62/86 versus 66/87, RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.13); <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>: 23/41 versus 17/44, RR 1.45 (95% CI 0.92 to 2.30)).</P>
<P>Based on the evidence from real clinical trials, audio-visual plus standard interventions (versus standard information) may make little or no difference to the rate of participation or willingness to participate in the parent study.

The authors report that the difference in median anxiety change score between the two groups favours the intervention group (-4.6 (95% CI -7.0 to -2.0)) but the post-intervention median anxiety scores between groups are similar (owing to the greater anxiety in the intervention group at baseline).</P>
<P>Based on the evidence from a single real clinical trial, we are uncertain whether audio-visual plus standard interventions (versus standard information) affect anxiety (or other psychological stress) of participants associated with the informed consent process.

<P>Based on the evidence from a hypothetical clinical trial, we are uncertain about the effect of audio-visual interventions (versus placebo interventions) on rate of participation or willingness to participate in the parent study.

<P>Based on the evidence from a real clinical trial, audio-visual interventions (versus placebo interventions) may make little to no difference on satisfaction with the media use to convey the information.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:19:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We found 12 new studies that were added to the 4 studies in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>), allowing us to draw somewhat firmer conclusions about the effects of audio-visual presentation of information for informed consent for people considering clinical trial participation (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Of the 16 studies, including 1884 participants, 9 studies were conducted with people considering real clinical trial participation, and 8 were conducted with people considering hypothetical clinical trial participation, with 1 study including participants considering both types of trials. For the majority of studies, the parent trial was investigating novel cancer treatments or psychiatric medications. The participants in these studies were varied; including people with a range of health conditions and 'nominally well' people. All studies were conducted in high-income countries, primarily the United States.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that this review focused on only one type of enhanced consent intervention, there was considerable heterogeneity in the audio-visual presentations tested. The presentations varied from simple audio-visual interventions, such as non-interactive videos, viewed independently, to computer programs with quizzes and hyperlinks, viewed under supervision. Many audio-visual interventions (and comparisons) included additional elements, such as written materials and/or face-to-face explanation.</P>
<P>The results from nine real clinical trials suggest that audio-visual presentation of informed consent information may slightly improve knowledge of the parent study but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. There is low to very low quality evidence that audio-visual presentation of informed consent may improve participant satisfaction with the consent information provided, but the effect on other aspects of satisfaction, such as satisfaction with the decision-making process, is unclear. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety (or other psychological distress) arising from audio-visual informed consent. The real clinical studies tell us very little about the experience of study personnel in providing audio-visual informed consent information. We found very low quality and conflicting evidence about whether audio-visual informed consent took more or less time to administer, and no study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process nor ease of use.</P>
<P>In addition, there is insufficient evidence about whether particular aspects of audio-visual presentation of informed consent information (such as interactivity) are more important than others, or whether additional elements, such as written materials or face-to-face explanation, have a benefit over and above the audio-visual component alone. It is important to note that for most of the real clinical studies, the quality of the evidence is low, meaning further research is likely to change the findings; it may strengthen the results or change the direction of effect.</P>
<P>The evidence from eight hypothetical clinical trials is broadly consistent with that of the real trials, but the very low quality evidence makes it difficult to draw any conclusions from these studies when considered in isolation. We note that many studies (in particular the hypothetical trials) are very small and likely to be underpowered, making it unlikely they could demonstrate an effect of the intervention, even if such an effect exists.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:25:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Population and setting</HEADING>
<P>The evidence in this review is drawn exclusively from high-income countries. In addition, half the studies in this review excluded participants with inadequate English comprehension. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>) explicitly sampled for participants with low literacy, and only three studies included more than 20% of participants from minority backgrounds (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>). These are important limitations since comprehension and satisfaction with informed consent processes tend to be lower among people with low literacy, including culturally and linguistically diverse groups and those with limited education (<LINK REF="REF-Breese-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breese 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fink-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 2010</LINK>). Studies have suggested that miscomprehension of information about clinical trials may reach very high levels among potential participants in low- and middle-income countries, and that these levels are substantially higher than those in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Krosin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krosin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moodley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moodley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ver_x00e1_stegui-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verástegui 2006</LINK>). Because the determinants of informed consent are complex and are not readily generalisable from high-income to low-and-middle income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Krosin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krosin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ver_x00e1_stegui-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verástegui 2006</LINK>), the effects of audio-visual interventions in other settings remain unclear.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2011</LINK>, in a recent systematic review, concluded that enhanced consent interventions have differential effects in people with low and high health literacy. The authors identified a number of design features of information interventions that mitigate the effects of low health literacy. Several of these are relevant to audio-visual informed consent, such as: the addition of a video to oral narrative, using tables for numerical information rather than text and adding icons to numerical information. This suggests that people with low literacy might find audio-visual informed consent interventions to be of greater benefit than those with high literacy, however this would need to be borne out in future research.</P>
<P>People with poor cognition are also particularly at risk of poor comprehension during the informed consent process (<LINK REF="REF-Appelbaum-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appelbaum 2010</LINK>). In this review, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>) compared the effects of audio-visual informed consent information in people with and without schizophrenia. These studies found a relatively greater improvement in knowledge with the audio-visual intervention in participants with schizophrenia, compared with participants without schizophrenia (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK> found no difference in the effect of the intervention on rate of participation between these groups. <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK> also considered the effect of audio-visual presentation of informed consent information in people with poor cognition, sampling only participants with mild Alzheimer's Disease or mild cognitive impairment. However, their results are consistent with most other studies in this review, and do not suggest a relatively greater beneficial effect in the intervention group. Finally, we note that these three studies had small (n = 188 for <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>) or very small (n = 35 for <LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) sample sizes for these outcomes, limiting the strength and applicability of this finding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">The control intervention</HEADING>
<P>The decision by most study authors to include additional written (sometimes simplified) consent documents (i.e. <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>) and/or in-depth face-to-face discussion or support (i.e. <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) in the intervention and often the control groups, muddies the water somewhat when assessing the effects of the audio-visual component of the intervention. While written consent materials and the opportunity to ask questions are standard elements of the consent process, they may not always be delivered as optimally in practice as under 'study conditions'.</P>
<P>In fact, there is evidence from a recent Cochrane review to suggest that the addition of these enhanced consent formats may favour the null hypothesis. In the context of people providing informed consent to have surgery, simplified written consent materials and detailed face-to face-discussion were both found to be effective in improving knowledge (<LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK>). The idea that both the intervention and control groups benefited from the consent materials with which they were provided is supported by the results of studies in this review. In all but five included studies, the post-intervention knowledge scores in both the audio-visual and comparison groups were at least 80% of the possible maximum score. In a further three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>) the knowledge scores in both groups were between 50% to 65%. This suggests either that participants in both audio-visual and comparison groups had high baseline knowledge scores or that both benefited from an enhanced informed consent intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design</HEADING>
<P>There is limited literature directly comparing the degree to which the results of hypothetical clinical trials mimic real clinical trials of informed consent interventions. We note that other reviews of these interventions which include both types of studies do not draw distinctions between them in describing the results (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="REF-Buchbinder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchbinder 2004</LINK>) of people considering enrolment in an HIV vaccine trial found that only 20% of those who indicated hypothetical willingness to participate subsequently enrolled in the trial. While there is insufficient evidence in this review to draw firm conclusions about how successfully hypothetical research can inform real-life clinical trial consent procedures, we note that the results of hypothetical studies in this review broadly reflect the real studies' results.</P>
<P>A number of subtle differences in interpretation of terms such as 'clinical trial' and 'potential participant' between our review and other systematic reviews published on this topic (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK>) have meant there are a small number of studies in those reviews that are excluded from this review. For example, we excluded two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bickmore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bickmore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGraw-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McGraw 2012</LINK>) as they asked people to consider donating genetic samples to a repository, rather than to participate in a clinical trial per se. As the field of informed consent research grows, we expect more studies to be published on seeking consent for new types of research, such as bio-banking (<LINK REF="STD-McGraw-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McGraw 2012</LINK>). In future updates of this review, the authors should consider whether the definition of a 'clinical trial' used in this review needs to be expanded to incorporate these newer kinds of studies. We also excluded studies in which participants were asked about future clinical research participation in general (<LINK REF="STD-Fureman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fureman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishii-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ishii 2007</LINK>) and those in which a specific trial was discussed but not all participants would have been eligible to take part (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 2011</LINK>). However, now that hypothetical clinical trials have been included in this review, these distinctions become more difficult to clearly define. The authors of future updates of this review may consider whether the inclusion criteria should be expanded further to include such studies. How the exclusion of these studies from this review may have affected the results is unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Outcome assessment for informed consent for research is problematic. Even for a seemingly uncomplicated outcome like knowledge/understanding, for example, there is not a 'gold standard' assessment method (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>). What constitutes 'adequate' knowledge or understanding with regard to clinical trial participation remains contentious (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>). For example, is a certain percentage of correct responses considered adequate? Where does this threshold lie? Is understanding of some components essential while of others less so? Is there agreement between researchers and participants in terms of what is most important? (<LINK REF="REF-Agre-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agre 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guarino-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>). These issues require further research.</P>
<P>Understanding or comprehension is, however, only one of several components of meaningful informed consent (<LINK REF="REF-Sugarman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugarman 1998</LINK>). Researchers and ethicists refer to 'decisional capacity' - an individual's ability to use information when deciding whether to undertake a particular treatment or to participate in research - to describe how meaningful the informed consent for clinical treatment or research is (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2006</LINK>). Decisional capacity includes at least four domains: understanding or comprehension of the relevant information; appreciation of the significance of the information and application to an individual's own situation; the ability to use the information in decision-making; and the ability to express a consistent choice or decision (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2005</LINK>). Each of these components need to be addressed for consent to be well informed. In a systematic review of tools to assess decisional capacity for both treatment and research, Dunn and colleagues noted that only a minority of tools assessed all four domains of decisional capacity, with most focusing solely or primarily on understanding or comprehension (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2006</LINK>). A few tools assessing decisional capacity more comprehensively, such as the validated MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research, were identified, but the authors noted that clear consensus and definition of the range of relevant outcomes is required in informed consent research.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:26:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The evidence from real clinical trials was rated as low quality for most outcomes, and for hypothetical studies, very low. We note, however, that this was in large part due to questionable study quality (that may reflect poor reporting rather than poor conduct), low participant numbers and the hypothetical nature of some studies, rather than inconsistency between study results or confirmed poor trial quality. While there is limited empirical evidence suggesting the decisions of participants in hypothetical clinical trials do not reflect those made in real clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Buchbinder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchbinder 2004</LINK>), we took a cautious approach and downgraded the evidence from these studies for indirectness. Basic improvements in future trials, such as using and reporting random sequence generation and allocation concealment and ensuring the study is sufficiently powered to achieve statistical significance, would greatly improve the quality of this evidence base and may alter the results of this review.</P>
<P>We note that the majority of studies in this review did not report a theoretical base underpinning their interventions, nor whether consumers were involved in the interventions' development. While these factors are not captured in Cochrane 'Risk of bias' domains (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>), nor in considerations of evidence quality using GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>), they are important considerations for consumer health information interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2011</LINK> suggests that the common features of information interventions that improve comprehension include being 'high intensity', theory-based, pilot-tested and delivered by a health professional with an emphasis on skill building. We echo the call by <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK>, in his recent systematic review on this topic, for a stronger theoretical base underpinning audio-visual informed consent development, and add that consumers should be more involved in an iterative development process.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:27:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We utilised standard methods for Cochrane reviews that are designed to minimise bias. Where possible, we contacted authors of included studies and key articles, and thus obtained additional information to supplement published trial reports. At least two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias, synthesised the results, and determined the GRADE ratings (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). We sought to ensure the wider applicability of the review by engaging consumer input throughout its development, and by consulting relevant consumer literature. Despite these strengths, it is possible that we did not identify all relevant published or unpublished studies. We welcome contact from anyone knowing of a potentially-eligible study not assessed for inclusion in this review. We did not conduct any handsearching, or any electronic searching of databases in languages other than English, although there were no language restrictions on the studies eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>There were some outcomes in the included studies, such as perceived importance of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>) and capacity to consent (<LINK REF="STD-Harmell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Harmell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>), that were not captured in this review as they did not reflect any of our pre-specified outcomes. In addition, to minimise the risk of selective outcome reporting, we collected one outcome per outcome category. This meant that although some studies (for example <LINK REF="STD-Strevel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strevel 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>) reported multiple outcomes of interest to this review, not all were extracted. In addition, rate of participation or willingness to participate in a trial was a primary outcome specified for this review. We recognise, however, that this is a complex outcome that may be affected by a range of factors, such as knowledge and/or understanding, satisfaction, anxiety and others. We note the recent Cochrane review assessing informed consent interventions for people considering surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK>) includes 'informed consent' as its primary outcome measure, incorporating a number of other outcomes such as knowledge, anxiety and satisfaction. Further refinement of the outcomes of this review may be warranted in future updates.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:30:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The findings of this review are broadly consistent with other evidence about the effects of audio-visual interventions used in the informed consent process for potential trial participants, although only one other review has meta-analysed results (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 2013</LINK>) and none considered the effects in real and hypothetical studies separately. Previous studies have noted, for example, the relative scarcity of rigorous research on informed consent for research in comparison with that on informed consent for clinical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sugarman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugarman 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>'s systematic review of various interventions to improve both real and hypothetical trial participants' understanding of information disclosed during the informed consent process identified 12 video and computer multimedia interventions assessed in 9 studies (8 of which were described as randomised). Flory identified 6 of the 16 studies that are included in our review (<LINK REF="REF-Agre-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agre 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK>). The other three studies identified by <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK> were excluded from our review due to: having no audio component (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Llewellyn_x002d_Thomas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Llewellyn-Thomas 1995</LINK>), and having no specific informed consent intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Fureman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fureman 1997</LINK>). Flory's review assessed the quality of included studies in a minimal fashion and did not apply the quality rating to the discussion of the review's results.</P>
<P>Nine of the interventions identified by Flory and colleagues resulted in no significant improvement in participants' understanding, although two did show improved retention of information at follow up. Overall, the authors concluded that "multimedia and enhanced consent form interventions do not consistently improve research participants' understanding. Person-to-person interactions, especially the extended discussion interventions, may be more effective" (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK>). As our review has identified ten additional studies since <LINK REF="STD-Flory-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2004</LINK> was published, we can draw slightly firmer conclusions as to the impact of audio-visual interventions on participants' knowledge.</P>
<P>A broadly-framed review by <LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2007</LINK> only identified two studies of multimedia interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Agre-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agre 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>) and similarly concluded that no single approach (of simplified written consent forms, use of trained professionals and multimedia interventions) appeared universally effective.</P>
<P>More recently, <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012 </LINK>reviewed the effects of multimedia tools on people's understanding of the information conveyed during the research consent process. Palmer's review was more limited in scope and methodology than this review, selecting only studies that were published in peer-reviewed English language journals, and only those measuring comprehension. They conducted a minimal search, and did not separate the studies into comparisons, nor meta-analyse the findings. <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK> identified 20 relevant comparative studies, of which 13 are included in our review and 7 studies are excluded for reasons including lack of random or quasi-random sequence generation, having no audio component, and having no specific informed consent intervention. Palmer and colleagues' conclusions were similar to those of our review regarding the knowledge outcome; specifically they found that multimedia tools have positive but inconsistent effects on knowledge, with the diversity of populations, interventions and assessment tools in the included studies making the identification of clear trends difficult. Common methodological limitations identified by <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2012</LINK>, with which our review agrees, included the lack of a guiding theory for intervention development, and the lack of structured, blinded outcome assessment.</P>
<P>A more rigorous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 2013</LINK>) investigated the effect of a range of enhanced consent interventions on knowledge, satisfaction, accrual and retention. The authors identified eight of the studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karunaratne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Karunaratne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kass-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kass 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 2005</LINK>) but this overlap was reduced to three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agre-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Agre 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2007</LINK>) in their meta-analysed results. This lack of overlap is partly explained by the fact that our searches are more recent (2012 compared to 2010) and that we excluded five of their included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bickmore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bickmore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fureman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fureman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Llewellyn_x002d_Thomas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Llewellyn-Thomas 1995</LINK>) for reasons explained in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. They included 7 of their 13 studies in a meta-analysis of knowledge, finding no evidence of an effect (SMD 0.32 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.85)). The authors note this result had high heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 90%) suggesting the result should be interpreted with caution. The authors investigated the observed heterogeneity through sub-group analysis but were not able to explain the variability. They investigated the effect of all enhanced consent intervention types on satisfaction and accrual. Similar to this review, they found a mixed picture of effectiveness for satisfaction and generally no effect on accrual (described in this review as 'rate of participation').</P>
<P>Finally, a recent Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK> assessed the effects of informed consent interventions for patients undergoing surgery in 65 trials. The authors conclude that informed consent interventions for people undergoing surgical and other invasive procedures generally improve knowledge and satisfaction with decision-making, reduce decisional conflict and have no effect on anxiety or satisfaction with the consent process. The effects of audio-visual and interactive multimedia consent interventions, as a sub-set of enhanced consent interventions, were broadly similar, improving knowledge, with no effect on satisfaction or anxiety.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:33:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:31:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The value of audio-visual interventions as a tool for helping to improve the informed consent process for people considering participating in clinical trials remains largely unclear.</P>
<P>There is now some low to very low quality evidence that such interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. It is unclear whether audio-visual presentation improves participant satisfaction with various aspects of the informed consent process. There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent interventions. There is very low quality and conflicting evidence about whether audio-visual interventions took more or less time to administer, and no study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use.</P>
<P>In the absence of clear results, triallists should continue to explore innovative methods of providing information to potential trial participants during the informed consent process, mindful of the range of outcomes that the intervention should be designed to achieve, and balancing the resource implications of intervention development and delivery against the purported benefits of any intervention. We note the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK> relating to consent for surgery, that suggest that any enhanced consent intervention is generally equally as effective. However, the applicability of these findings to the area of clinical trial consent remain unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:33:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>More real clinical trials with a sufficiently powered sample size would enhance our understanding of the effects of audio-visual informed consent interventions for people considering clinical trial participation. Triallists should seek to minimise the risk of bias in their studies by ensuring adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, and by blinding (where possible) participants, intervention providers and outcome assessors. Study reporting in this field also requires improvement; trial authors should adhere to the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>), particularly in terms of the methods they use to minimise the risk of bias, and in terms of participant numbers and the flow of participants through each stage of the trial.</P>
<P>Future trials in low-and-middle income countries, and with people with low literacy or poor cognition, would strengthen this field of research and increase the applicability of this evidence. Triallists may wish to consider the principles of consumer participation, underlying theory, and design aspects that mitigate the effects of low health literacy, in the development of audio-visual informed consent interventions. Equally, separating the additional consent elements, such as simplified written materials and in-depth discussion, from the audio-visual and comparison groups may allow for effective comparisons that are not conflated with the effects of other enhanced consent interventions. A qualitative systematic review of consumer perspectives of interventions to enhance informed consent could inform the development of future interventions and the selection of relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>Relevant outcomes which should be assessed in future trials include: knowledge and its retention over time, satisfaction with the information provided, participation rate, anxiety, satisfaction with the decision-making process, adherence to the parent study protocol and post-consent withdrawal from the parent study. Informed consent as a unified outcome measure incorporating elements such as knowledge and satisfaction with decision-making could also be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK>). The MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2006</LINK>) could be a useful measure for future triallists, allowing greater consistency in the measurement of knowledge, in addition to an assessment of whether the decision whether to consent was truly informed. Process measures, such as time taken to administer and/or develop the audio-visual intervention and researcher-specific outcomes such as satisfaction and ease of use would inform the implementation of audio-visual consent materials.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-04-09 14:37:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Before this review update was commenced, we made a number of changes to methods derived from the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objectives: we re-worded the objectives to better reflect the change in outcome order</LI>
<LI>Types of participants: we included studies in which participants were asked to consider taking part in a hypothetical clinical trial situation (see background section for justification). We include a definition of 'clinical trial'</LI>
<LI>Types of interventions: we expanded the types of interventions we included for comparison with audio-visual interventions to include standard and placebo audio-visual interventions</LI>
<LI>Types of outcomes measures: we structured the outcomes according to primary and secondary outcomes and re-ordered them. The outcome 'Anxiety' was broadened to include 'Anxiety (or other psychological stress)' and two clinical researcher-related outcome measures, along with time taken to administer the intervention, were added, to increase the relevance of the findings to this stakeholder group</LI>
<LI>Search methods for identification of studies: to account for the change in inclusion criteria we revised the search strategies and conducted the searches without date restriction. This search yield replaces the original search yield for this review</LI>
<LI>Data extraction and management - small changes were made to the type of data extracted. Additionally we incorporated detailed information about the interventions and outcomes that was provided in two tables in the previous version of the review, into the Characteristics of Included Studies tables</LI>
<LI>Assessment of risk of bias of included studies - we replaced the original assessment of study bias with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook.</I>
</LI>
<LI>We added 'Summary of findings' tables</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, we expanded the methods relating to the analysis of data to better reflect current headings and methodological guidance for Cochrane reviews. These changes are outlined under the following sections of this review; Measures of treatment effect, Unit of analysis issues, Dealing with missing data, Assessment of heterogeneity, Assessment of reporting biases, Data synthesis, Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity and Sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>The text in these sections replaces the following text that was included in an appendix of the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>) for application in future updates:</P>
<P>"Analysis would include calculation of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes, using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan) software. The Chi-squared test would be used to test for heterogeneity in outcomes. A fixed effects model would be used unless heterogeneity was found, in which case a random effects model would be used. Primary analyses would be on an 'intention to treat' basis.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses (to evaluate the effects of trial quality on meta-analysis results) and subgroup analyses (to assess the effects of the timing of the video intervention delivery relative to the informed consent process; the timing of outcome assessment with reference to the video intervention delivery; the use of the video intervention for the guardians of individuals asked to participate in a clinical study; and the effects on people with low literacy or people from other language groups) would be conducted if possible.</P>
<P>These methods will be retained for application in a future update of the review, if statistical pooling becomes possible."</P>

<P>Aim of intervention: To improve people's knowledge and understanding of trials to which they are considering consenting to participate.</P>
<P>Theoretical basis: not reported.</P>
<P>Development: The consent document for each of the 18 oncology protocols was assessed for reading level, and amended to fall at the 8th grade reading level. Language for the basic consent tools was identical, with summary/review sections added to the video and computer interventions.The consent form was used as the basis for scripts produced by the researchers.</P>
<P>Components: All interventions were given alone (i.e. with no additional material).</P>
<P>AV Format (media): Video: video, Computer: computer-assisted instructional program delivered on a CD. Both the video and computer interventions had scripts which implies that there was audio.</P>
<P>AV Interactivity: All interventions were not interactive.<BR/>Content: Was based on the trials for which consent was being sought. Included description of the purpose of the research and research procedures; side-effects, risks, benefits and alternatives; confidentiality/privacy; and the right to refuse/withdraw from the study.</P>
<P>Length: Length of video/computer intervention was dependent on the oncology trial: the shortest was 10.24 minutes, the longest 21.39 minutes.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Language: English.</P>
<P>Number of times viewed: Once. Authors note that none of the participants viewed/read the intervention more than once, although a small number of patients reviewed sections.</P>
<P>Intervention quality: Video and computer intervention were professionally produced; the videos used professional talent (no further details available).</P>
<P>Viewing setting: Interventions were delivered in private consultation rooms.</P>
<P>Target audience: Patients and/or their family members/friends considering enrolling in oncology trials. Unrelated non-patient subjects waiting for patients in Surgical Day Hospital waiting area.</P>
<P>Recipient: Patients and family members; unrelated participants.</P>
<P>Delivery of the intervention: No details provided.</P>
<P>Details of providers: All interventions were delivered by the principal investigator, or by one of two trained study research assistants.</P>
<P>Fidelity/integrity: The authors advised that all interventions were delivered as intended but not how this was assessed. Yes; all interventions were always delivered as intended.</P>
<P>Components of usual care/control: written information.</P>
<P>Format of usual care/control: Participants were given the written material (no further information provided).</P>

<P>Outcome: Knowledge/understanding.</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: retention of consent information.</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Proportion of correct responses on a 12- to 15-item multiple choice knowledge quiz (created for each of the 18 oncology protocols). Self-completed by participants.</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not applicable.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: once.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: immediately post-intervention.</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions:"Media consent tools are not a panacea for improving informed consent knowledge. Moreover these tools cannot simply be a conversion of standard consent information to another format....An important finding... is that on average, no one in any group or demographic correctly answered more than two-thirds of the knowledge questions. There is great potential for using the computer as an interactive learning tool that could engage patients and accommodate different styles of learning and different preferences for information."</P>

<P>Theoretical basis: Not reported<BR/>Development: The intervention was developed in-house, by the research team.<BR/>Components: instructional videotapes (standard and improved) were delivered with standard informed consent (unassisted disclosure) or additional information disclosed by investigator (assisted disclosure).<BR/>AV format (media): Videotape: 'standard' and 'improved' videotape versions.</P>
<P>AV interactivity: Both video interventions were non-interactive.</P>
<P>Content: The videotapes employed were described as 'instructional&#8217; (standard) and 'improved&#8217; for the two different intervention components. The standard video format involved the principal investigator or other designated project staff from the psychiatric trials describing the study as he/she chose to do so. This typically reflected the usual presentation made to subjects at the time of consent. The improved video format included feedback from the research team about areas of the disclosure that could be improved or required greater emphasis.

<P>Outcome: Knowledge.</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: Prompted recall.</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Questions adapted from the Deaconess Informed Consent Comprehension Test (questions covering procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives and the rights of study participants). Administered orally, responses scored later via audiotapes.<BR/>

<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not applicable.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: Once.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: Immediately post-intervention.</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: No statistically-significant main effects were found for the amount of information demonstrated through either free or prompted recall. Stronger trends towards media effects were found when less skilled readers alone were considered. Findings support idea that simplified print benefits comprehension for those with most limited reading skills.</P>
<P>Outcome: Rate of participation</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: Likelihood of agreeing to enrol one's child in the described study.</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Verbal question from data collector to participants including reasons why the stated choice was made. <BR/>

<P>Number of times measured: Once.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: Immediately post-intervention.</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: Neither apparent comprehension, reading level, nor format experienced significantly affected hypothetical decision to enrol. Simulated agreement to participate varied as a function of risk; almost four times as many would have declined higher risk Heart study than low risk Preemie study.

<P>The enhanced written intervention arm was excluded from this review because it was neither an audio-visual intervention nor a standard consent intervention.The authors report two knowledge measures, free recall and prompted recall. Free recall was measured by asking participants to describe all they could remember about the study and participants were scored on how many pieces of information they recalled. Due to the fact that prompted recall was measured in a way that was consistent with other studies (by questionnaire) this outcome measure was selected for the purposes of this review.</P>

<P>The authors state that "We investigated participants' comprehension of consent information in reference to a hypothetical clinical trial of an experimental cognition enhancing medication that was developed for our earlier study of DVD-aided consent (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2009</LINK>)" however it is unclear whether it was the informed consent form itself or the multimedia intervention that was the same as the Jeste study.  This also study measured capacity to consent (as measured by the UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) however it was not included as capacity to consent was not an outcome included in this review. Three of the four sub-scales used in the MacCAT-CR meet our criteria for the knowledge outcome. The fourth sub-scale (expression of a choice was excluded from the review). These include: Understanding (including understanding of purpose, potential benefits and risks), appreciation (recognise the difference between treatment and research and the voluntary nature of participation) and reasoning (being able to describe potential study consequences). We ranked the effect estimates of the three outcomes measures to determine the median effect estimate, reasoning. As such, we used this sub-scale as the measure of understanding for the purposes of this review.</P>

<P>First published as a conference abstract (Hitchcock-Bryan 2007).  After outcome measurement between groups, the control group was then given the video and the perceptions of both groups about the clinical trials video was recorded.  As both groups received the intervention prior to measuring perceptions, these outcomes are not included in the review.  The authors reported two knowledge outcomes: objective knowledge and self-reported knowledge. As the authors identified objective knowledge as their primary outcome we only collected this outcome for purposes of the review.</P>
<P>Additionally, the authors report on participants 'perceptions of the Clinical Trials Video", including outcomes that matched the outcomes included in this review, such as whether the video assisted participants to make a decision about clinical trial participation and whether watching the video was worthwhile. However, these perceptions were captured after the RCT element of the trial was completed, and control participants had also watched the video, meaning there was no comparison between groups. As such, these data were not included in the outcomes reported in this review. The authors also measured rate of participation, but only report this for the participants overall, and this appears to have been assessed after the control participants also viewed the video.</P>

<P>Aim of intervention: To inform patients about randomised controlled trials, as a supplement to their trial-specific written information sheet.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Theoretical basis of intervention: Not reported.</P>
<P>Development of intervention: Video development informed by the literature and overseen by an advisory group (nurse, doctor, psychologist and researcher) and an expert panel (2 current patients).  Other expertise was sought from health, ethics and clinical trial experts.  An operational project team (consisting of nurses experienced in directing and script writing, a professional actress and the hospital's medical illustration department) created the video.  </P>
<P>Components of intervention: DVD/CR-ROM/video plus a discussion with a doctor plus written information.</P>
<P>AV format (media): Intervention created in different formats (participants able to choose their preferred format).  N = 48 (56%) chose DVD, n = 37 (43%) chose video and n = 1 (1%) chose CD-ROM. </P>
<P>AV interactivity: Not interactive.<BR/>Content: Topics include how drugs/treatments are developed, importance of clinical trials, what randomised trials are and when they are carried out, criteria for taking part, benefits/disadvantages of taking part in a randomised trial, funding issues, voluntariness of decision and freedom to withdraw at any time.  Randomisation is described by an actress using flip charts with pictures.  The video includes pictures of patients receiving treatment.</P>
<P>Length: 10 minutes.</P>
<P>Language: English.</P>
<P>Number of times viewed: Not reported.  Patients watched the AV intervention at home, so they may have watched it more than once.</P>
<P>Intervention quality: AV intervention quality: used nursing staff who had experience with directing and script writing.  Professional actress used in the video.  The medical illustration department edited the video.  No mention of intervention quality of other staff involved in delivering the standard care element of the intervention.</P>
<P>Viewing setting: At home.  Not reported if they viewed it individually or with family members.</P>
<P>Target audience: Colorectal, breast or lung cancer patients.</P>
<P>Recipient: Participants.</P>
<P>Delivery of the intervention: Patients initially discussed the clinical trial and were given the trial specific information sheet and consent form by a registrar or consultant (visit 1).  They were given the AV intervention at this time (in a format of their choosing) and instructed to watch it at home.  Participants returned to their doctor (visit 2) and discussed whether they wanted to participate in the trial.<BR/>Details of providers: Registrar or consultant from the tumour site team delivered the discussion/written information.  No further information reported about other providers involved in delivering DVD etc.</P>
<P>Fidelity/integrity: Not reported for the intervention group as a whole, however of the 73 participants in the intervention group who completed the questions about their perceptions of the AVPI in the Clinical Trials Decision Questionnaire, n = 70 (96%) had watched the video.</P>
<P>Components of usual care/control: Face-to-face explanation of the trial specific information sheet and consent form.</P>
<P>Format of usual care/control: A consultant or registrar from the tumour site team discussed the treatment trial and administered a trial-specific information sheet and consent form. </P>
<P>Content of usual care/control: Trial specific information sheet and consent form covered the same basic principles as the AV intervention but while the consent forms covered broad information about randomisation as a process, it focused more on the specific details of the trial itself.  The AVPI gave more details and examples to explain about randomisation.  The 18 different consent forms contained different (trial-specific) information but contained the same type of information as they were developed with guidance from the same ethics committee.</P>
<P>Delivery of control: Delivered by registrar or consultant from the tumour site team at the first visit. Information delivered by clinician in visit 1 and discussed again (re decision to participate) at visit 2.</P>
<P>Quality of usual care/control: Not reported.<BR/>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2014-04-09 15:07:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Outcome: Knowledge.</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: Knowledge.</P>
<P>Method of assessment: A 12-item questionnaire was developed by the research team A 12-item questionnaire was developed by the research team, assessing knowledge of trial aims, randomisation and rights of participants.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not reported.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: Twice.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: At visit 1 (explanation of treatment trial) and visit 2 (return visit, usually one week later, to discuss decision).  Outcome measures were both assessed after the patient had visited the doctor and the timing was consistent between groups.</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: The findings support the use of AVPI as useful in terms of improving patient knowledge and understanding before decision making.  In both groups, patients were more knowledgeable following the information-giving process.  Improvements in the knowledge score tended to be higher in the AVPI arm. An increase in knowledge did not make people more likely to participate in the clinical trial. </P>
<P>Outcome: Rate of participation.</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: Clinical trial refusal rate (see notes).</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Review of case notes.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not reported.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: Once.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: At visit 2 (one week post intervention).</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: AVPI had no effect on refusal rates to the randomised cancer trials that the patients were offered. The observed refusal rate for clinical trials in this study, approximately 20%, is substantially less than that reported in the literature.  There were no significant differences in consent rates associated with rates of disease. AVPI was not shown to have any effect on refusal rates to randomised cancer trials.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Outcome: Anxiety or other psychological harm.</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: Anxiety.</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory .<BR/>
</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not reported.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: Twice.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: At visit 1 (explanation of treatment trial) and visit 2 (return visit, usually one week later, to discuss decision).</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: There was a statistically-significant difference in anxiety score at baseline; patients in the AVPI arm appeared to be more anxious than in the control arm.  The change in anxiety scores over time was also significant between groups.  Anxiety improved in the AVIP arm more than in the control arm. The change from pre- to post- intervention in the AVPI group was highly significant. There was no significant change in the control group. AVPI was effective in improving knowledge and understanding without raising anxiety.<BR/>

<P>Aim of intervention: Not explicitly stated but the authors hypothesised that the intervention would improve understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expression of choice .<BR/>
</P>
<P>Theoretical basis of intervention: Informed by the principles of multimedia learning theory: learning is facilitated when information is simultaneously provided through both verbal and visual-spatial/pictorial channels (Baddeley, A. <I>Working Memory, Thought, and Action</I>.  New York, NY: Oxford University Press).</P>
<P>Development of intervention: The development of the DVD was heavily informed by the principles of learning theory but no user-testing, stakeholder input was described.  Authors refer to previous pilot data but no reference for this work is reported.</P>
<P>Components of intervention: DVD plus written information.</P>
<P>AV format (media): DVD presentation that included audio of narrator verbally explaining key points, simultaneous visual presentation using graphics, still pictures and animation, and summary text.</P>
<P>AV interactivity: Not interactive but participants were able to ask RA to stop and repeat segments of the DVD at any stage.<BR/>Content: The content of the DVD was based on the written consent form.  Information was broken into 13 chapters, including: description of the purpose and procedures of the study, the potential risks from study procedures and medications (those typical of cholinomimetics), potential benefits (including possible lack of direct personal benefits), the limits of payment for treatment for research-related injuries, the voluntary nature of participation, procedures for withdrawal from the study, confidentiality (and procedures to foster it), and means of addressing any questions or concerns.</P>
<P>Length: Unclear how long actual DVD was, average time for multimedia consent procedure was 22 minutes.</P>
<P>Language: English.</P>
<P>Number of times viewed: Participants were encouraged to stop the DVD and repeat any segments that were unclear.</P>
<P>Intervention quality: AV intervention informed by theory and a previous pilot is mentioned.  The simulated consent form was based on the consent form for an actual pilot study being conducted at UCSD and was similar to a simulated consent form used in the authors' prior research. Two IRB members reviewed the form during development to help ensure content validity.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Viewing setting: The AV intervention was viewed individually with an RA but the setting was not described.</P>
<P>Target audience: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI).</P>
<P>Recipient: Participants.</P>
<P>Delivery of the intervention: A research assistant gave participants a written consent form and administered the AV intervention.  Participants were encouraged to ask the research assistant to repeat sections of the DVD, or to stop and discuss any questions.<BR/>Details of providers: Delivered by a research assistant, but no details of the number involved, nor any training provided.</P>
<P>Fidelity/integrity: Not reported.</P>
<P>Components of usual care/control: written informed consent plus control DVD.</P>
<P>Format of usual care/control: Participants met individually with a research assistant and watched the 10-minute control DVD.  They were then provided with the written informed consent and were encouraged to read the form as it was read out by the research assistant.</P>
<P>Content of usual care/control: Content of written consent form as per the content of the AV intervention.  Content of control DVD: general research information.  Length of DVD 10 minutes, average time taken for whole consent process was 26 minutes.</P>
<P>Delivery of control: Delivered once, by a research assistant.  Participants were asked to stop and ask for clarification at any time.</P>

<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not applicable.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: Three (we used the third time point only - see notes).</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: After any initially misunderstood information presented in the intervention had been re-explained to participants by study personnel.</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: Among schizophrenia patients, those in the multimedia group had significantly better scores on MacCAT-CR understanding at trial 1, 2 and 3. Among healthy subjects, the only significant difference was higher MacCAT-CR understanding at trial 2 in the multimedia group. Overall conclusion of the authors, schizophrenia outpatients provided with a multimedia-aided consent procedure demonstrated better comprehension of a research protocol, compared with those presented with an enhanced consent procedure.</P>
<P>Outcome: Rate of participation.</P>
<P>Definition used by authors: Rate of agreement to participate (although presented as % who declined to participate - see notes).</P>
<P>Method of assessment: MacCAT-CR questionnaire, sub-scale 4 rated whether participants were able to clearly state whether they were willing to participate in the study.  The authors used the response to this item to compare whether or not they agreed or declined to participate<BR/>
</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: Not applicable</P>
<P>Number of times measured: The MacCAT-CR was measured three times but the authors only report a single rate of participation.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: Unclear if the reported rate of participation was taken from the first, second or third MacCAT-CR results (therefore could have been before or after the re-explanation - see notes).</P>

<P>The primary outcome measure was capacity to consent which is not a pre-specified outcome in this review and hence is not included.</P>
<P>We pooled the two population sub-groups, healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients, together.</P>
<P>Three of the four sub-scales used in the MacCAT-CR meet our criteria for the knowledge outcome. The fourth sub-scale (expression of a choice) was excluded from the review. These include: Understanding (including understanding of purpose, potential benefits and risks), appreciation (recognise the difference between treatment and research and the voluntary nature of participation) and reasoning (being able to describe potential study consequences). These outcomes were measured at three time points (after intervention, after re-explanation of initially misunderstood concepts and after a second re-explanation of misunderstood concepts) but only the understanding sub-scale was reported at all three time points. The other two scores were only presented for one time point but the authors did not specify which time point this was. As a result, we used the understanding outcome and took the longest time point (trial 3). This outcome measure was recorded after participants had had any misunderstood information re-explained to them twice.</P>
<P>The authors present their results in a table that outlines the total number of participants included in the analysis for the healthy control subjects but not for the schizophrenia patients. The number of participants in the healthy subjects intervention and control groups matches the number randomised and the authors report that all subjects randomised "completed the study described". For this reason we assume that the total number of participants in the schizophrenia intervention and controls groups matches the number randomised for the knowledge and rate of participation outcomes.</P>
<P>The authors reported the percentage of people who declined to participate in the study. We reversed these numbers (i.e. 100% - the given %) so that they represented the % of participants of agreed to participate in the study. We multiplied the percentages by the total number of participants in each group to obtain number of people, rather than % of people for the rate of participation outcome.</P>

<P>Aim of intervention: Not reported.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Theoretical basis of intervention: Not reported.</P>
<P>Development of intervention: The content was based on the NCI Clinical Trials Pamphlet (used in the control group) and discussions with oncologists.  Scripts were drawn from in-depth interviews with patients.  The computer-based tool was reviewed by patients, oncologists and nurses and changes made as a result of this.</P>
<P>Components of intervention: Computer-based tool alone.  Participants then had an appointment with their oncologist after viewing the intervention.</P>
<P>AV format (media): Computer-based tool with written and narrated information and video clips of actors portraying patients.</P>
<P>AV interactivity: Participants could click on the video clips to play them but no further interactivity is reported<BR/>Content: The intervention described the three phases of drug testing, including the different purposes of each, ways in which patients might benefit from trial participation other than medically, urged patients to discuss risks and benefits with their oncologist, and emphasized voluntary nature of participation. It also included embedded video clips of five actors portraying patients who decided to enrol in a clinical trial (three) or not to enrol (two) and clips of two oncologists (one actual, one actor) describing the purpose and benefits of early phase clinical trials. At relevant points, pictures of patients or oncologists would appear on the screen. Patients could then start a clip by touching a picture. After each section, patients were provided a suggested question to ask their doctors.  The last screen listed all the questions, and the patients could receive the entire list to take to an appointment with the oncologist. </P>

<P>Format of usual care/control: Written information plus appointment with oncologist.</P>
<P>Content of usual care/control: The pamphlet covered similar topics to the intervention, including information about the three phases of clinical drug testing.  It covered the process of randomisation, common protections for participants, benefits and harms.  The pamphlet included information on post marketing trials, which the intervention did not.  It provided a set of suggested questions that participants might want to ask their doctors.</P>

<P>We obtained no useable data for this study and the authors were not able to provide any more information. There was one outcome related to knowledge (understanding the purpose of the investigational study) that could potentially have been included in the review however the response options were multiple choice and it is unclear whether there was one or more correct answer. The included outcomes (rate of participation and satisfaction with the decision-making process) reported the percentage of participants who responded with yes/no but not the overall number of participants in this group. Additionally, the authors reported on a number of outcomes that did not meet the pre-specified outcomes of this review, including, "Why do you think the physician talked to you about joining the study", perceptions about how taking part in the study may affect their prognosis and reasons for declining to participate.</P>

These include: Understanding (including understanding of purpose, potential benefits and risks), appreciation (recognise the difference between treatment and research and the voluntary nature of participation) and reasoning (being able to describe potential study consequences). These outcomes were measured at two time points (after intervention and after re-explanation of initially misunderstood concepts). We ranked the effect estimates of the three outcomes measures taken at the longer time point (trial 2, after re-explanation). The median effect estimate was for the understanding sub-scale.

<P>* Note that the trial reports inconsistent participant numbers: stating initially that 278 participants signed consent forms and were randomised; and later, that 200 participants were randomised to two groups. We have used n = 200 participants, assuming 100 were allocated to each of two groups, for this review.</P>
<P>For the knowledge outcome measure, the authors report the percentage of participants who scored 10 correct, 1-2 incorrect, 3-6 incorrect, 6-9 incorrect and 10 incorrect questions. We converted this to a dichotomous outcome (adequate knowledge, inadequate) knowledge. We set the cut off for adequate knowledge at 80% as this is the value used in <LINK REF="STD-Weston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 1997</LINK>. Therefore, adequate knowledge includes participants who scored 10 correct and 1-2 incorrect responses. We also assumed n = 100 participants in each group as the table of results presents percentage of participants only.</P>

<P>Aim of intervention: To provide audio-visual descriptions of research procedures and rights.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Theoretical basis of intervention: The multimedia consent procedure was developed using the learning-objective approach (no reference provided).</P>
<P>Development of intervention: Authors performed a pre-study which developed and assessed the intervention for evaluation in the RCT that followed. Three groups of 8 parent-child dyads were recruited to the pre-study: each group separately viewed 3 versions of the procedure descriptions in different orders. Participants&#8217; preferences and comprehension were assessed and compared for each of the three presentation methods. Video versions were rated as most preferred over paper versions and a trend towards improved comprehension, therefore the video format was selected for assessment in the RCT.</P>
<P>Components of intervention: Computer slide alone.<BR/>
</P>
<P>AV format (media): Powerpoint document with 5 embedded hyperlinks to video content embedded within the document.</P>
<P>AV interactivity: Interactive: the parent-child dyads could click on the hyperlinks.<BR/>Content: Included three hyper linked sections on research rights : what research is; what assent means; the right to refuse participation or withdraw at any time. Two hyper linked sections about the study-specific procedures (DXA and ultrasound): video showing an adolescent male being prepared for an having each of the procedures with narrative voice-over explaining the risks and purpose of each procedure. The text was created using short declarative sentences and using age-appropriate examples.  Explanatory text used in both intervention and control arms was identical.</P>
<P>Length: 7 to 10 minutes.</P>
<P>Language: English, using 3rd grade language.</P>
<P>Number of times viewed: once; each hyper linked section was accessed once by each parent-child dyad.</P>
<P>Intervention quality: The intervention was based on developmental work undertaken in the pre-study. All interactions between participants and researchers were scripted to ensure consistency.</P>
<P>Viewing setting: Not reported.</P>
<P>Target audience: Potential child participants and their parents.</P>
<P>Recipient: Participants and guardians.</P>
<P>Delivery of the intervention: Parent-child dyads were seated next to each other with either a laptop computer (multimedia) or paper form in front of them.<BR/>Details of providers: Not reported.</P>
<P>Fidelity/integrity: There was an error in delivery of one intervention component meaning that the learning objectives for question 1 (study purpose) was not delivered as designed for the intervention (this question was therefore removed from post-process assessment questions).</P>
<P>Components of usual care/control: Written information.</P>
<P>Format of usual care/control: Paper-based assent document.</P>
<P>Content of usual care/control: The paper-based assent document contained the same information (explanatory text) as the multimedia assent tool and took a similar time to complete (7 to 10 minutes).</P>

<P>This study included parent-child dyads, who viewed the intervention together and then provided their answers to the collected outcomes. As the participants were correlated we couldn't include both sets of data. We therefore selected parents as the participants in our review, as they were the only group who provided true consent to participate (the children instead providing assent). The authors reported overall comprehension scores, self-rated comprehension by visual analogue scale and the results of 1-2 specific questions within the comprehension questionnaire.  Because the overall comprehension score was used in the sample size calculation, we took this as the primary outcome measure. </P>

<P>Authors' conclusions: Most patients (86%) had previously heard of clinical trials but only 49% had previously heard of phase I studies before the phase I clinic visit. Compared with patients viewing the placebo DVD, those viewing the educational DVD were significantly less likely to believe that the goal of phase I clinical trials was to decide if a new drug was more effective than an old one, significantly more likely to know that the drug had been tested in animals but not thoroughly in humans and significantly less likely to believe phase I drugs have proven anti-cancer effects in humans.</P>

<P>Number of times measured: Once.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: Outcome collected once participants had decided whether they were going to participate (often immediately post-intervention to up to a few weeks later).</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: There was no significant difference between educational and placebo DVD in terms of numbers of participants consenting to participate; nor were reasons for non-participation significantly different between the two groups. Reasons cited included concern of toxicity and the highly investigational nature of the trial, availability of other approved treatment options, poor functional status excluding trial participation, and incapacity to provide informed consent.</P>
<P>Outcome: Satisfaction with the media used.</P>

<P>Outcome: Knowledge/understanding.<BR/>Definition used by authors: Content knowledge (knowledge of study protocol and knowledge of PROM).</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Number of correct responses on an 11-item questionnaire. Self-completed by participant.</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: After assessment 1, arrangements were made by the study nurse for each woman to complete the questionnaire again in 2 to 4 weeks.</P>
<P>Follow-up for non-respondents: unclear.</P>

<P>Timing of outcome assessment: immediately post-intervention.</P>
<P>Outcome: Recall of knowledge/understanding.<BR/>Definition used by authors: Content knowledge (knowledge of study protocol and knowledge of PROM).</P>
<P>Method of assessment: Number of correct responses on an 11-item questionnaire. Self-completed by participant.</P>
<P>Methods for follow-up of non-respondents: After assessment 1, arrangements were made by the study nurse for each woman to complete the questionnaire again in 2 to 4 weeks.</P>
<P>Follow-up for non-respondents: unclear.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: once.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: 2 to 4 weeks following recruitment (video group: median 17 days, range 9 to 15 days; control group: median 16.5 days, range 10 to 56 days).</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: There was no statistically-significant difference initially in the number of women in the two groups that answered at least 9 of 11 content questions correctly. Two to four weeks later the number of correct content questions was lower in both groups but the video group had retained more information than the control group.</P>
<P>Outcome: Rate of participation.</P>
<P>Definition by authors: willingness for future participation.</P>
<P>Method of assessment: 1-item questionnaire. Self-completed by participant.</P>
<P>Timing: After assessment 1, arrangements were made by the study nurse for each woman to complete the questionnaire again in 2 to 4 weeks.</P>
<P>Follow-up for non-respondents: unclear.</P>
<P>Number of times measured: twice.</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: immediately post-intervention (assessment 1); 2 to 4 weeks following recruitment (video group: median 17 days, range 9 to 15 days; control group: median 16.5 days, range 10 to 56 days) (assessment 2).</P>
<P>Authors' conclusions: "The showing of a patient information video may increase the willingness of women to participate in a research trial, and may have the additional effect of educating them about the health problem and specifics of the trial. This willingness to participate seems to decrease over time and therefore a patient information video may be most helpful at the time informed consent is requested."<BR/>

<P>Theoretical basis of intervention: Not reported.</P>
<P>Development of intervention: Not reported.</P>
<P>Components of intervention: Educational video.</P>
<P>AV format (media): Within the video, each point is presented in three modalities&#8212;text bullets, voiceover narration, and brief enacted vignettes with professional actors playing a doctor/recruiter and a patient reviewing major consent topics.</P>
<P>AV interactivity: Not interactive.<BR/>Content: The videotape was written to be generic and applicable to a wide range of conditions, protocols, and treatments. Addresses three areas: 1) optimal behavior during the recruitment session, 2) the content that the informed consent session covers, and 3) good decision making. The videotape repeatedly emphasizes the need for the patient to be active, open about any failure to understand, and assertive in seeking information.  Major consent topics covered included the purpose of the study, the benefits, the risks and voluntariness.  A final section emphasizes the need to consider pros and cons and to weigh costs and benefits of participation in the decision-making process. </P>
