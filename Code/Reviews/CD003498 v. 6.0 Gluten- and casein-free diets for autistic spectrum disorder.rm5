<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. </P>
<P>An extensive literature search was carried out to identify any randomised control trials of gluten and/or casein free diet as an intervention to improve behaviour, cognitive and social functioning in individuals with autism. Only three papers reporting on two randomised control trial were identified, two small scale trials the first with ten participants in each arm of the trial and the second with fifteen participants recruited into the trial. The results for the first study indicated that a combined gluten and casein free diet reduced autistic traits and the second study showed no significant difference in outcome measures between the diet group and the control group. This is an important area of investigation and large scale, good quality randomised control trials are needed. None of the studies reported on adverse outcomes or potential disbenefits.</P>
<P>There is evidence of widespread use by parents of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) including exclusion diets for their children with autism. Despite this, there is a lack of evidence to support the use of gluten and/or casein free diet as an effective intervention for persons with autism and also a lack of research on potential harms and disbenefits of such diets. Despite the problems of maintaining the integrity of such diets in the community it is possible to carry out randomised control trials to address these questions and more and adequately powered trials are needed in this area.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of people with autism.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of gluten and/or casein free diets as an intervention to improve behaviour, cognitive and social functioning in individuals with autism.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: CENTRAL(The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007), PsycINFO (1971 to April 2007), EMBASE (1974 to April 2007), CINAHL (1982 to April 2007), ERIC (1965 to 2007), LILACS (1982 to April 2007), and the National Research register 2007 (Issue1). Review bibliographies were also examined to identify potential trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCT) involving programmes which eliminated gluten, casein or both gluten and casein from the diets of individuals diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Abstracts of studies identified in searches of electronic databases were assessed to determine inclusion by two independent authors The included trials did not share common outcome measures and therefore no meta-analysis was possible. Data are presented in narrative form.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two small RCTs were identified (n = 35). No meta-analysis was possible. There were only three significant treatment effects in favour of the diet intervention: overall autistic traits, mean difference (MD) = -5.60 (95% CI -9.02 to -2.18), z = 3.21, p=0.001 (Knivsberg 2002) ; social isolation, MD = -3.20 (95% CI -5.20 to 1.20), z = 3.14, p = 0.002) and overall ability to communicate and interact, MD = 1.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.90), z = 2.77, p = 0.006) (Knivsberg 2003). In addition three outcomes showed no significant difference between the treatment and control group and we were unable to calculate mean differences for ten outcomes because the data were skewed. No outcomes were reported for disbenefits including harms.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Research has shown of high rates of use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) for children with autism including gluten and/or casein exclusion diets. Current evidence for efficacy of these diets is poor. Large scale, good quality randomised controlled trials are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:23:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a Cochrane Review published by the authors in 2004.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:22:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by the triad of impairments identified by Wing, including impairments of social functioning, communication and lack of flexibility of thought and behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1996b</LINK>). These impairments persist from childhood to adulthood and can have a severe impact on learning and social integration. Fombonne's review of the epidemiology of autistic spectrum disorders reports that these disorders affect between 0.7 to 21.1 per 10,000 children (<LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:23:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diets in which all gluten, or casein or gluten and casein are excluded.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:23:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reichelt et al hypothesised that peptides from gluten and casein have an aetiological role in the pathogenesis of the disorder of autism (<LINK REF="STD-Reichelt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reichelt 1991</LINK>). It has been suggested that the pathophysiology and psychology of autism can be explained by excessive opioid activity linked with the above (<LINK REF="STD-Israngkun-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Israngkun 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichelt-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichelt 1981</LINK>). Urine samples of people with autism have been reported to show an increased 24-hour low molecular weight peptide excretion (<LINK REF="STD-Israngkun-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Israngkun 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichelt-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichelt 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shattock-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shattock 1990</LINK>) and increased opioid levels in cerebrospinal fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Israngkun-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Israngkun 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichelt-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichelt 1981</LINK>). Based on analysis of urine samples, dietary intervention involving the exclusion of foods containing gluten or casein, or both, has been proposed to be effective in ameliorating some of the behavioural symptoms of autism. An investigation by Reichelt et al indicated that casein has a similar chemical structure to that of gluten (<LINK REF="STD-Reichelt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reichelt 1991</LINK>). Due to this similarity, it is hypothesised that if a person has a sensitivity to either they will have sensitivities to both, although these sensitivities need not be of equal severity. The inability to adequately process gluten and casein is proposed to result in or exacerbate a variety of disorders including postpartum psychosis, schizophrenia, and autism (<LINK REF="REF-Reichelt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichelt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reichelt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reichelt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichelt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichelt 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inadequately metabolised proteins are purported to breakdown into peptides that are absorbed across the dietary membranes into the body's systems. It is suggested that these peptides may become biologically active through binding with opioid receptors. The resulting excess of opioids is thought to lead to the behaviours noted in autistic spectrum disorders. Further, it is suggested that although high levels of peptides are appropriately deposited in the urine, a small proportion of the excess peptides will cross into the brain causing interference of signal transmission (<LINK REF="STD-Reichelt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reichelt 1991</LINK>). This can lead to a disruption of normal activity. One hypothesis surrounding the variation in behaviour of children and adults with autism is linked to food reactivity/sensitivity. It is postulated that the disruptive behaviour evidenced in many individuals with autism is directly linked to particular foods, for example, wheat and dairy products (<LINK REF="REF-Reichelt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichelt 1994</LINK>). In addition to the various behavioural difficulties demonstrated, it is suggested that communicative ability and social and cognitive functioning are similarly affected (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Knivsberg et al have argued that the peptides probably derived from gluten and casein have a negative pharmacological effect on attention, brain maturation, social interaction and learning (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 1995</LINK>). Hence, they hypothesise that appropriate diets would facilitate learning, social behaviour, cognitive functioning and communicative skills in individuals with autism.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:22:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Authors such as Hanson et al have reported high rates of use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) by parents of children with ASD including dietary supplements and restrictive diets (Hanson 2007). In their survey of 112 families 74% reported using a CAM therapy. The main reasons reported for their use were concerns about the safety and side effects of prescribed medications. Wong and Smith compared the use of CAM therapy in fifty families with a child member with ASD and families with no ASD (Wong 2006). They found significantly higher rates of use of CAM therapies in the families with an autistic child. Six of the families with a child with autism were using or had used a casein free diet and nine of the families with a child with autism were using or had used a gluten free diet for their child (Wong 2006).</P>
<P>The importance of this review in the light of evidence of widespread use of CAM therapies including exclusion diets is as follows. There is a need to assess the available evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of diets that include gluten and/or casein free diet but also to identify any disbenefits associated with these diets. Gluten and/or casein are to be found to varying degrees in diets worldwide and are ubiquitous in Western diets which are in turn becoming more common throughout the world. The consequences of this is that it is a challenge to parents to identify food products without gluten or casein and it can be a problem to source food products guaranteed to be without gluten or casein. Restriction diets often cost more than the standard diet and may involve extra effort in providing the special meals for the child with autism and normal meals for the rest of the family. For the child with autism the consequences are twofold. There may be physical health consequences of such elimination diets such as the loss of benefits of cow's milk for healthy growth in the child which must be supplemented in other ways. In addition, the child with autism is already restricted in lifestyle by her/his disorder but undergoes a further lifestyle restriction in terms of diet.</P>

<P>Two randomised control trials met the criteria for inclusion. Knivsberg et al's study was a small single phase trial and Elder et al's study was a small pilot, randomised, crossover trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants </HEADING>
<P>Both studies recruited children who met criteria for autistic spectrum disorder.</P>
<P>In Knivsberg et al's study participants had been recruited from all parts of Norway via journal announcements and school psychological services, and participation was based on written consent. Mean age range of the intervention group was 91 months (range 62 to 120); mean age range of the control group was 86 months (range 59 to 127). Entry criteria included a diagnosis of autism and the presence of abnormal urinary patterns of peptides. There were 10 participants in each arm of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Elder et al's study fifteen child participants (mean age 7.32 years, SD=4.1 years, range 2-16 years) were recruited into the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>). Inclusion criteria were meeting the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for autism disorder and a score above cut off on each symptom domain of the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R). Exclusion criteria were medical history or physical examination indicating physical or sensory impairment or significant medical problems including celiac disease. Twelve boys and three girls were recruited into the trial with one child of Asian origin and the remainder described by the authors as Caucasian.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes </HEADING>
<P>Knivsberg et al reported on four outcome measurements in their first paper: number of autistic traits (see below for fuller description), linguistic age in months, non-verbal cognitive level and motor problems. Data were presented as both group means and standard deviations and individual patient data for both before and after scores, and standard deviations were calculated and presented below. The four outcomes reported in their second paper were the four subscales of the DIPAB, a Danish instrument for measuring autistic traits (<LINK REF="REF-Haracopos-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haracopos 1975</LINK>) the four subscales are: resistance to communication, bizarre behaviour, communication and interaction and social isolation.</P>
<P>Elder et al (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>) reported on the following outcome measures: the Childhood Autism rating Scale (CARS), Urinary Peptide Levels (UPL), Ecological Communication Orientation (ECO) Language Sampling Summary; and in-home observations based on samples of video tape of the child interacting with his/her primary care-taking parent. The interactions were rated in six categories: child initiating, child responding, intelligible words spoken, parent initiating, parent responding and parent expectant waiting (for the child's response).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Duration of trial</HEADING>
<P>In Knivsberg et al's study the duration of the trial was 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>). Elder et al's study lasted twelve weeks with crossover after six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Thirty three studies were excluded from the review, principally because they did not meet the criteria for study design. Reasons for exclusion are detailed in the Table of excluded studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ongoing studies</HEADING>
<P>We identified one ongoing study sponsored by the US National Institute of Mental Health at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York. Details of this study are shown in the 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' table.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> for 'Risk of Bias' tables.</P>
<P>Both included trials were small scale studies. Knivsberg et al's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>) consisted of twenty participants and Elder et al's trial had fifteen participants (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The method of randomisation in Knivsberg et al was pair-wise matching by severity of autistic symptoms and randomly allocate, within each pair, to treatment or control group. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were not described in the published papers, but we established through contact with the authors that coin-tossing had been used and that both randomisation and allocation had been undertaken independently of the project team conducting the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Knivsberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knivsberg 2004</LINK>). The trial reported by Elder et al was a double blind, crossover trial. The method of randomisation was not described.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK> trial the outcomes assessors were blinded. In the <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>, the child participants, parents and investigative team, with the exception of the data manager and dietician, were blind to allocation.</P>
<P>Knivsberg et al reported baseline scores for all outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>). One participant is described as "not responding to the cognitive and linguistic tasks" and scores are not reported for these two outcomes for this participant. There was no loss to follow up. Elder et al reported urinary Peptide Levels measures at baseline and weeks three, six, nine and twelve. All other outcome measures were carried out at baseline and weeks six and twelve. The authors employed a missing at random model for the three participants whose data was incomplete (CARS and ECO) at week six or week twelve.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:36:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was not sufficient homogeneity of participants interventions comparators and outcomes to carry out meta-analysis and therefore it was also not possible to carry out funnel plots. There were not sufficient studies and data to assess the impact of study quality using sensitivity analysis. We have presented the results for the two included studies, individually.</P>
<P>Treatment effect sizes were not calculated for continuous data that were skewed, skewedness being defined as when the mean is less than twice the standard deviation. Elder et al (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>) report the results of a crossover trial and although the authors' report that they were advised that a "wash out" period would not be necessary we adopted the more prudent strategy of reporting on only the results of the first phase of the trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Difference between baseline and end of trial scores</HEADING>
<P>Individual patient data were available for Knivsberg et al's study for the four outcomes of number of autistic traits, linguistic age in months, non verbal cognitive level and motor problems (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>). This enabled us to calculate the more sensitive measure of difference score; that is to say, we could subtract the baseline score from the end of trial score for each individual patient and calculate the mean and standard deviation for each arm of the trial from this. However, in all cases the data could not be used because it was skewed.</P>
<P>The results for the difference scores were as follows. For the number of autistic traits (data on ten participants in each arm of the trial) the diet group showed a mean reduction in the number of traits of 6.90 (standard deviation (SD) = 2.42) and the control group a mean reduction of 0.30 (SD = 3.94). For linguistic age (data on nine participants in each arm of the trial) in months the diet group showed a mean increase of 11.11 (SD = 8.79) and the control group a mean increase of 7.89 (SD = 10.03). For non verbal cognitive level (data on nine participants in each arm of the trial) the diet group showed a mean increase of 5.67 (SD = 6.54) and the control group a mean decrease of 10.44 (SD = 13.59). For motor problems (data on ten participants in each arm of the trial) the diet group showed a mean decrease of 3.00 (SD = 6.19) and the control group a mean increase of 3.10 (SD = 6.21).</P>
<P>All other results below are based on end of trial scores only:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Concentration of peptides in urine samples</HEADING>
<P>Knivsberg et al did not report investigations of peptide concentrations in the urine samples of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>). In Elder et al's trial data was not reported in a usable form for urinary peptide levels but the authors report that there was no significant difference between groups for this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Behavioural observations and standardised assessments of autistic behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Knivsberg et al assessed overall autistic traits by combining the social isolation and bizarre behaviour sub scores of the DIPAB. The sub scores are described in more detail below. Post intervention, the diet group had a mean autistic trait score of 5.60 (SD = 2.41) compared to the control group mean score of 11.20 (SD = 5.00). Mean difference (MD) = -5.60 (95% CI -9.02 to -2.18), z = 3.21, p=0.001 (<LINK REF="REF-Knivsberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knivsberg 2003</LINK>). The results favour the intervention group.</P>
<P>The sub score results for social isolation were calculated from the questions related to resistance to communication and interaction and questions related to ability to interact and communicate. At the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 3.0 (SD=1.4) and for the control group the mean was 6.2 (SD=2.9). MD = -3.20 (95% CI -5.20 to 1.20), z = 3.14, p = 0.002). The results favoured the intervention group.</P>
<P>Resistance to communication and interaction was computed from scores for verbal and nonverbal communication, reaction when spoken to, resistance to learning, sharing of feelings, reaction to physical contact, eye contact and peer relationship. A decrease in score shows positive development. At the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 0.2 (SD=0.4) and for the control group the mean was 1.9 (SD=1.4). MD was not calculated for this outcome as the data were skewed.</P>
<P>Knivsberg et al measured bizarre behaviour using the bizarre behaviour score for the DIPAB which measures compulsive or stereotypic communication, echolalia, adult dependency, strange emotional reactions, abnormal anxiety, reactions to changes in the environment or routines peculiar handling of toys and playing materials, attachment/affinity for special items and unusual movements or motor behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Knivsberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knivsberg 2003</LINK>). At the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 2.6 (SD=1.7) and for the control group the mean was 4.8 (SD=2.6). MD was not calculated for this outcome as the data were skewed.</P>
<P>Elder et al used the CARS scale which rates a number of behaviours including relationship with others; imitation; emotional expression; body use; peculiarities in object use; resistance to change; visual, auditory and tactile responsiveness; anxiety; verbal and non verbal communication; activity level and intellectual ability. At the end of the first phase the mean score for the diet group was 33.60 (SD=8.60) and for the control group the mean was 31.20 (SD=8.70). MD = 2.40 (95% CI -6.66 to 11.46), z = 0.52, p = 0.60); this was non-significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Communication and linguistic ability </HEADING>
<P>Knivsberg et al assessed linguist age using one of two tests depending on the age and functional level of the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>). The tests were the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Ability (ITPA) (<LINK REF="REF-Gjessing-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gjessing 1975</LINK>), as standardised for Norwegian children, or the Reynells språktest (language-test) (<LINK REF="REF-Hagtvet-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagtvet 1986</LINK>). Post intervention, the diet group had a mean linguistic age in months of 66.60 (SD = 35.10) compared to the control group mean age of 55.70 (SD = 28.30). MD was not calculated for this outcome as the data were skewed.</P>
<P>Knivsberg et al assessed the child's overall ability to communicate and interact from the computed scores for verbal and non verbal communication, reaction when spoken to, resistance to learning, sharing of feelings, reactions to physical contact, eye contact, peer relationship, and handling of toys and play materials (<LINK REF="REF-Knivsberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knivsberg 2003</LINK>). An increase in score shows positive development. At the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 6.20 (SD=1.10) and for the control group the mean was 4.50 (SD=1.60). MD = 1.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.90), z = 2.77, p = 0.006). This result favoured the intervention group. Elder et al also used the Ecological Communication Orientation (ECO) Language Sampling Summary to record the child's behaviour and collect interactive samples. At the end of the first phase the mean score for the diet group was 175.80 (SD=86.40) and for the control group the mean was 174.40 (SD=86.00). MD was not calculated for this outcome as the data were skewed.</P>
<P>In addition, Elder et al recorded the following scores for which we were not able to calculate a standardised treatment effect size because the data was skewed:</P>
<P>In-home observations-child initiating: at the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 9.5 (SD=9.6) and for the control group the mean was 7.5 (SD=6.1).<BR/>In-home observations-child responding: at the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 27.7 (SD=21.8) and for the control group the mean was 14.3 (SD=6.5).<BR/>In-home observations-intelligible words spoken: at the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 26.8 (SD=35.1) and for the control group the mean was 24.0 (SD=43.5). In-home observations-parent initiating: at the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 61.2 (SD=37.0) and for the control group the mean was 71.6 (SD=34.9). In-home observations-parent responding: at the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 15.2 (SD=11.6) and for the control group the mean was 20.1 (SD=13.6). In-home observations-parent expectant waiting (for the child's response): at the end of the trial the mean score for the diet group was 2.3 (SD=1.4) and for the control group the mean was 1.9 (SD=2.7).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Cognitive functioning </HEADING>
<P>Knivsberg et al measured the participants non-verbal cognitive level using the Leiter International Performance Scale (LIPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Leiter-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiter 1979</LINK>). Post intervention, the diet group had a LIPS mean score of 86.7 (SD = 38.5) compared to the control group mean score of 74.30 (SD = 31.40). MD = 12.40 (95% CI -20.06 to 44.86), z = 0.75, p = 0.45 (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>); result not significant.</P>

<P>The published protocol for this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Millward-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millward 2002</LINK>) did not pre-specify that outcomes concerning motor ability would be sought; however, we will include this information both here and in future updates of the review. Knivsberg et al reported that motor problems were assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1992</LINK>). Post intervention, the mean score for the diet group was 26.3 (SD = 11.50) compared to the control group mean score of 27.80 (SD = 12.20). MD = -1.50 (95% CI -11.89 to 8.88), z = 0.28, p = 0.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>), result not significant.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identified two studies and there was not sufficient homogeneity of outcomes to undertake meta-analysis. One study showed significant lower autistic traits in the intervention group compared to the control group and the other study showed no difference between the intervention and the control group. </P>
<P>Knivsberg et al reported results on four outcomes in their first paper (<LINK REF="STD-Knivsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Knivsberg 2002</LINK>). Unfortunately we were not able to use the data on one of the outcomes, linguistic age, because the data were skewed. Unsurprisingly in such a small scale study, the results for two of these outcomes (cognitive skills and motor ability) had wide confidence intervals that spanned the line of nil effect. However, the third outcome, reduction in autistic traits, showed a beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten and casein free diet. The second paper (<LINK REF="REF-Knivsberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knivsberg 2003</LINK>) reported the results of the four subscales of the DIPAB but unfortunately we were unable to use the results for two of the scales, resistance to communication and bizarre behaviour, because the data were skewed. The results for the other two outcomes, communication and interaction and social isolation, all showed a significant treatment effect size in favour of the diet intervention. However, when interpreting these results it should be born in mind that the data for one of the significant outcomes in the second paper, social isolation, is also a component of the data on the significant outcome in the first paper, autistic traits. </P>
<P>The second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK>) reported usable data on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) but there was no significant difference between the diet and control group for this outcome. They reported data on the Ecological Communication Orientation (ECO) Language Sampling Summary and all six outcomes of the in-home observation but in every case the data were skewed. Data was not reported in a usable form for urinary peptide levels but the authors report that there was no significant difference between groups for this outcome. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK> was particularly well designed both in its formal structure (double blind with adequate concealment of allocation) and the care with which the diets were tailored to individual participant's needs and preferences. The authors acknowledge two significant problems with there study. This was a small scale study, intended only as a pilot for a much larger study and the authors declared their suspicions that the integrity of the diet may have been breached by participants requesting food from siblings and peers.<BR/>Neither study report a washout period which might be an important factor in this area, particularly in short term trials. If gluten and/or casein peptides have a long term residual effect, after their elimination from the diet, the impact in short duration trails would be to minimise the treatment effect size between the intervention and control group. This less of a problem in Knivsberg et al's study than in Elder et al's shorter term study and one way round this would be that future trails should commence with a washout period of the exclusion diet for both intervention and control groups. Neither study reported disbenefits including harms and costs of these diets.</P>
<P>Four years on from the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Millward-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millward 2002</LINK>) we were only able to identify one paper providing extra information on the trials included in the first review, one new trial and one ongoing trial. This is disappointing bearing in mind the extent to which these diets are being used by parents of children with autism. In the first version of this review we said that "Researcher's in the field are attempting to explore the effectiveness of these dietary interventions on persons with autistic spectrum disorder but to date there has not been evidence of sufficiently rigorous methodology to eliminate other explanations for these beneficial changes. Only well conducted and adequately powered RCTs will resolve this issue and we await, with interest, further developments in this field". <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2006</LINK> answers the first need by providing the blueprint for a well designed trial in this area though thought needs to be given to the provision of a washout period prior to the commencement of the trial proper. The second problem of adequate power is still to be addressed.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the first version of this review we argued that exclusion diets are not without cost in terms of inconvenience and extra financial cost and limitations on foods of choice for the affected family member and that we could not recommend their use as a standard treatment on the basis of the limited data available. The only trial identified since the first review shows no significant difference between the intervention and control group and, again, we cannot recommend these exclusion diets as standard treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Well-conducted and adequately-powered randomised controlled trials are urgently needed in this area. Elder's et al's pilot trial provides a useful model which needs to be replicated with an adequate sample size.</P>

Outcomes - the identity of the person(s) carrying out the endpoint assessments was not stated specifically in the paper but may have been the project leader, nor whether they were blind to allocation status of the participants.

<P>Authors note a number of limitations to the study including that 'monitoring of the compliance with diet was not carried out' (p.254, col.1), difficulty deciding whether 'changes are due to intervention or maturation' (p.254, col.1), and the possibility of a placebo effect. Each of these has the potential to introduce bias.</P>

<P>Quote: 'Children, parents, and all of the investigative team except for the data manager and dietician were blind to the dietary order' (p.417, col.2). Quote: 'Before unblinding, parents were asked to comment on whether they thought their child was on the GFCF diet the first or second 6 weeks. Five were correct, two had 'no idea', and six were incorrect' (p.418, col.2). Comment: Probable that all except data manager and dietician were blind to allocation. Adequacy of blinding was tested satisfactorily for the parents.</P>

<P>Quote: The authors state that, of the 15 randomized, 'thirteen of the children completed the 12-week protocol' (p.416, col.1). They ' . . employed a missing at random model for the three of 15 subjects whose week 12 or week 6 data were incomplete on a major variable' (p.418, col.2).

<P>Authors note a number of limitations to the study including that: (a) the sample was small in size and was heterogeneous 'possibly contributing to a Type 2 error' (p.419, col.1) (b) there was occasional non-compliance with 'several reports of children 'sneaking food' from siblings or classmates' (p.419, col.1) (c) the duration of treatment was relatively short (12 weeks), given that there are 'clinical reports of some children who respond to the GFCF diet quickly, while others take several weeks before behavioral effects are detectable' (p.419, col.2). (d) the possibility of a placebo effect Each of these has the potential to introduce bias.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Apart from the potential sources of bias acknowledged by the authors, the study was apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias</P>
