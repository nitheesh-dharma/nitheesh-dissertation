The labels will also need to be altered accordingly. Happily there is not too much data to change in this review! I cannot tell whether the PC20 should have a negative sign in the results in the text (what does the negative sign in metaview refer to here?) The other results look fine in the text.&lt;br&gt;In the study types considered you specify placebo control, but this does not seem to apply to the dietary exclusion comparison?&lt;br&gt;Can you support your conclusion that in individuals who are allergic to tartrazine an avoidance diet helps (FROM THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;31/5/2001&lt;br&gt;Reviewer reply (Felix):&lt;br&gt;Chris thank you for your comments.&lt;br&gt;All data re-entered without the negative signs and the graphs labels altered accordingly. &lt;br&gt;PC20 was positively reported in text, therefore the negative sign has been removed from here as well.&lt;br&gt;Under &amp;quot;Types of Interventions&amp;quot; we specified the comparisons we were looking at (i.e. placebo and also dietary avoidance). However, we have added a line under &amp;quot;Types of studies&amp;quot; to make this clearer.&lt;br&gt;Conclusion revised due to limited evidence. &lt;br&gt; 31/5&lt;br&gt;Dear Felix,&lt;br&gt;This looks great. Could you just check the data for PC20 as the Tartrazine mean is slightly different from the previous version (this could easily be RevMan) and slightly alters the estimate and confidence interval for the results. Which is correct? Also I suggest the following replacement sentence for Types of Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All challenge studies were randomised-controlled trials with placebo groups, whilst dietary avoidance was compared with a normal diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the review can go to Paul for Peer Review etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;31/05/2001&lt;br&gt;Reviewer reply (Felix):&lt;br&gt;Thanks Chris for the record turn-around time. &lt;br&gt;I have re-checked the data for PC20 its correct as it stands. &lt;br&gt;Suggested replacement sentence added after being changed as follows: All trials were randomised controlled studies. Tartrazine challenge trials used placebo groups as controls and dietary avoidance trials compared with normal diet as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5/6/2001&lt;br&gt;Ready to go - subtotals switched off for symptoms scores.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-09-04 16:45:27 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett" REVIEW_NO="TAR-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Tartrazine is the best known and one of the most commonly used food additives. Food colorants are also used in many medications as well as foods. There is no evidence that tartrazine makes asthma worse or avoiding it makes asthma patients any better.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Tartrazine is the best known and one of the most commonly used food additives. Food colorants are also used in many medications as well as foods. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether tartrazine causes exacerbations of asthma with some studies finding a positive association especially in individuals with cross-sensitivity to aspirin. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the overall effect of tartrazine (exclusion or challenge) in the management of asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A search was carried out on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. Bibliographies of each RCT was searched for additional papers. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for further information. Searches are updated annually and are current as of February 2006. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs of oral administration of tartrazine (as a challenge) versus placebo or dietary avoidance of tartrazine versus normal diet were considered. Studies which focused upon allergic asthma, were also included. Studies of tartrazine exclusion for other allergic conditions such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis and eczema were only considered if the results for subjects with asthma were separately identified. Trials could be in either adults or children with asthma or allergic asthma (e.g. sensitivity to aspirin or food items known to contain tartrazine).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study quality was assessed and data abstracted by two reviewers independently. Outcomes were analysed using RevMan 4.1.1.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-07 13:41:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Ninety four abstracts were found, of which 20 were potentially relevant. Six? met the inclusion criteria, but only three presented results in a format that permitted analysis and none could be combined in a meta-analysis. In none of the studies did tartrazine challenge or avoidance in diet significantly alter asthma outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Due to the paucity of available evidence, it is not possible to provide firm conclusions as to the effects of tartrazine on asthma control. However, the six RCTs that could be included in this review all arrived at the same conclusion. Routine tartrazine exclusion may not benefit most patients, except those very few individuals with proven sensitivity.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-22 15:55:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>In recent years, adverse reactions to food additives have been a subject of public debate and concern. There is considerable disagreement regarding its importance in the pathogenesis of asthma but ingested food additives can trigger episodes of wheezing. Clearly, it is important to determine the frequency and relevance of such hypersensitivity in individuals with asthma so that advice on dietary manipulation can be targeted more effectively.</P>
<P>Food additives are extensively used by the food industry to prevent spoilage, prolong shelf life, and enhance appearance or taste and in the processing of certain foodstuffs. Food colorants are used in the mass production of many foods, which are no longer obtained from their traditional sources or made with the original ingredients, to give them the appearance of the traditional product. Azo dyes, which possess a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond, are commonly used because of their colourfastness. Tartrazine (FD&amp;C yellow # 5) is the best known and one of the most commonly used azo dyes (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1986</LINK>). Food colorants are also used in many medications (<LINK REF="REF-Lockey-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockey 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-MacCara-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacCara 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1976</LINK>) as well as foods (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1977</LINK>). In a 1989 survey of colourings and preservatives in drugs in the UK, it was showed that in 2,204 drug formulations there were 419 different additives (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 1989</LINK>). Of these, 52 were dyes or preservatives, which had been implicated, in adverse reactions. Tartrazine was the fourth most commonly occurring colorant occurring in 124 drug formulations.</P>
<P>The observed association between food colorants and asthma is not a new one. Reports on children whose asthma appeared to be exacerbated by food colours date from 1958. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether tartrazine causes exacerbations of asthma with some studies (including double blind challenges) finding a positive association especially in individuals with cross-sensitivity to aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Genton-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genton 1985</LINK>). Other researchers have not been able to demonstrate any link between tartrazine and asthma (again including double blind studies). However, it has been shown that withholding bronchodilator therapy on the day of the challenge led to false positives being recorded. </P>
<P>There is a need to resolve whether exclusion of a common food additive such as tartrazine from the diet of an individual with asthma confers any significant benefit in terms of improvement of symptoms and reduction in the need for medication. Advice to exclude such substances may involve considerable impact on the individual's lifestyle in terms of change of diet, cost of food and avoidance of certain drugs. It could also have implications for the food and pharmaceutical industries.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To estimate the overall efficacy of tartrazine (exclusion or challenge) upon asthma symptoms, medication requirements, lung function, non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity and allergen bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All trials were randomised controlled studies. Tartrazine challenge trials used placebo groups as controls and the dietary avoidance trials compared the intervention group with a group who had a normal diet. Double-blinded trials were preferred, but single blind and open studies were also reviewed for possible inclusion. Studies, which focused upon allergic asthma, were also included but if there were a sufficient number of studies, we would have separated the two types of studies. Studies of tartrazine exclusion for other allergic conditions such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis and eczema were only considered if the results for subjects with asthma were separately identified.</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'asthma' were searched using the following terms: </P>
<P>"azo dye*" or "azo compound*" or tartrazine* or "sunset yellow" or azorubin or amarant or benzenesulfonate* or pyrazole* or sulfite* or (food* and (color* or colour*))</P>
<P>This search is updated annually. The most recent search was carried out in February 2006. </P>
<P>The reference list of each RCT was searched for additional papers. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for further information for their trials and details of other published or unpublished studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All trials that appeared potentially relevant were assessed by two reviewers independently who selected trials for inclusion. Agreement between the two reviewers was recorded. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>All trials were graded using the Cochrane allocation concealment grades: </P>
<P>Grade A - Adequate allocation concealment<BR/>Grade B - Unclear allocation concealment<BR/>Grade C - Inadequate allocation concealment<BR/>Grade D - Allocation concealment not used </P>
<P>Outcome data were extracted independently by two reviewers. All disagreements were resolved through discussion. </P>
<P>The planned comparisons for statistical consideration were as follows:</P>
<P>1. Tartrazine challenge vs placebo<BR/>2. Tartrazine exclusion or avoidance vs control (untreated controls or normal diet)</P>
<P>Categorical outcomes were analysed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) calculated for each outcome measure. Continuous outcomes were analysed as either weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with effect sizes calculated using fixed or random effect model.</P>
<P>Tests for heterogeneity were performed for each outcome. If significant heterogeneity were demonstrated for individual comparisons, sensitivity analysis would have been undertaken to identify the source. A priori defined sub-groups for this purpose were: dose of tartrazine, tartrazine and drug reactions, duration of intervention, adults vs children.</P>

<P>Searches identified 90 titles and abstracts, that were screened to identify 18 potentially relevant studies involving tartrazine in patients with asthma. Full text versions of these 18 papers were obtained and assessed independently by two reviewers. They agreed to include six trials in the review. Twelve trials that were excluded have their reasons for exclusion noted in the table, "Characteristics of excluded studies". Details of the six included studies can be found in the table, "Characteristics of included studies". An attempt was made to contact all authors for verification of methodological quality, classification of the intervention(s) and outcomes of data. No replies have been received to date.</P>
<P>Update searches conducted in February 2005 and 2006 did not identify any relevant new studies. An updated search from 2011 identified four studies, two of which were potentially relevant and added to studies awaiting classification,</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>As data from the six included studies were limited, no firm conclusions can be drawn from this review regarding the effects of tartrazine exclusion in asthma. However, the six trials individually provided conclusions that were very similar. The five challenge trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hariparsad-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hariparsad 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virchow-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Virchow 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1979</LINK>) concluded that tartrazine did not change any clinical outcome, although it should be noted that none of these studies was preceded by a period of tartrazine avoidance. The one dietary avoidance trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tarlo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tarlo 1982</LINK>) also failed to show any benefit in the management of asthma. </P>
<P>There may be a need for further randomised controlled trials in order to confirm the absence of any effect of tartrazine on asthma control.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no clear evidence that tartrazine challenge makes asthma worse or that tartrazine avoidance makes it better. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To facilitate a greater understanding of the possible role of tartrazine and other food additives in exacerbating symptoms of asthma, it is recommended that a further larger scale RCT is conducted which considers the following methodological issues: blinded method to generate random sequence, state method used to conceal treatment allocation to intervention and control groups, blind assessors and state how they were blinded, include a larger sample size, include relevant outcome measures (e.g. lung function, asthma symptom scores, medication requirements) and report all relevant data completely.</P>
