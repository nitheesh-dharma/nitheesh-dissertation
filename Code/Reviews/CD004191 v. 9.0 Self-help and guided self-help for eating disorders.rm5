<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The eating disorders (anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)) are disabling conditions and specialist treatment is not always easily accessible. Self-help may bridge the gap. This review aimed to evaluate pure self-help (PSH) and guided self-help (GSH) interventions for eating disorders for all ages and genders, compared to psychological, pharmacological or control treatments and waiting list. Fifteen trials were identified, all focused on BN, BED or EDNOS, using manual-based self-help. There is some evidence that PSH/GSH reduce eating disorder and other symptoms in comparison to waiting list or control treatment and may produce comparable outcomes to formal therapist-delivered psychological therapies. PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment. In the future there need to be large well-conducted effectiveness studies of self-help treatments with or without guidance incorporating cost evaluations and investigation of different types of self-help in different populations and settings.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) are common and disabling disorders. Many patients experience difficulties accessing specialist psychological treatments. Pure self-help (PSH: self-help material only) or guided self-help (GSH: self-help material with therapist guidance), may bridge this gap.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Main objective: <BR/>Evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) / controlled clinical trials (CCTs) for the efficacy of PSH/GSH with respect to eating disorder symptoms, compared with waiting list or placebo/attention control, other psychological or pharmacological treatments (or combinations/augmentations) in people with eating disorders. </P>
<P>Secondary objective:<BR/>Evaluate evidence for the efficacy of PSH/GSH regarding comorbid symptomatology and costs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched in November 2005, other electronic databases were searched, relevant journals and grey literature were checked, and personal approaches were made to authors. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Published/unpublished RCTs/CCTs evaluating PSH/GSH for any eating disorder. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data was extracted using a customized spreadsheet. Relative Risks (RR) were calculated from dichotomous data and weighted/standardized mean differences (WMD/SMD) from continuous data, using a random effects model. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve RCTs and three CCTs were identified, all focusing on BN, BED, EDNOS or combinations of these, in adults, using manual-based PSH/GSH across various settings.</P>
<P>Primary comparisons: <BR/>At end of treatment, PSH/GSH did not significantly differ from waiting list in abstinence from bingeing (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09), or purging (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08), although these treatments produced greater improvement on other eating disorder symptoms, psychiatric symptomatology and interpersonal functioning but not depression. </P>
<P>Compared to other formal psychological therapies, PSH/GSH did not differ significantly at end of treatment or follow-up in improvement on bingeing and purging (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31), other eating disorder symptoms, level of interpersonal functioning or depression. There were no significant differences in treatment dropout. </P>
<P>Secondary comparisons:<BR/>One small study in BED found that cognitive-behavioural GSH compared to a non-specific control treatment produced significantly greater improvements in abstinence from bingeing and other eating disorder symptoms. Studies comparing PSH with GSH found no significant differences between treatment groups at end of treatment or follow-up. Comparison between different types of PSH/GSH found significant differences on eating disorder symptoms but not on bingeing/purging abstinence rates.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment and may have potential as an alternative to formal therapist-delivered psychological therapy. Future research should focus on producing large well-conducted studies of self-help treatments in eating disorders including health economic evaluations, different types and modes of delivering self-help (e.g. computerised versus manual-based) and different populations and settings. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The eating disorders anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are common and disabling conditions with overlapping symptomatologies and aetiologies, affecting mainly young females. AN is characterized by raised mortality and all eating disorders have high levels of physical and psychological comorbidity. Thus, they have serious implications for sufferers' quality of life, work and social functioning.</P>
<P>The incidence of BN cases presenting to primary care for treatment has increased in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Currin-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currin 2005a</LINK>) and there has been a marked increase in the incidence of AN in younger cases (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1999</LINK>). The life-time prevalences of AN and BN in young females are 2% to 4% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Favaro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Favaro 2003</LINK>). The prevalence of BED is approximately 1-3% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinzl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinzl 1999</LINK>). People who do not neatly fit the diagnostic criteria of AN or BN (i.e. they are sub-threshold for these disorders or have mixtures of symptoms of both disorders) are given the label of "Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified" (EDNOS). EDNOS forms a sizeable proportion of cases encountered in the community and in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Fairburn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairburn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Favaro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Favaro 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Eating disorders typically begin in mid-adolescence or early adulthood. The first few years following the onset of eating disorder symptoms are recognized to be a critical period. During this time, the illness can have a marked influence on emotional, social and educational development, and physical health and development can be stunted. The consensus view among professionals is that early intervention is likely to prevent the disorder becoming chronic (<LINK REF="REF-Treasure-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treasure 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Currin-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currin 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Psychological therapies are the treatment of choice for all eating disorders. In AN, whilst there is no leading evidence-based psychological therapy, specialist psychotherapies of different types seem to be more effective than non-specialist support or dietetic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2004</LINK>). In BN, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the best evaluated form of psychotherapy and seems to be at least as effective or more effective than other forms of psychological treatment (for example, interpersonal therapy, behavioural therapy). A similar picture emerges in the treatment of BED (<LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2004</LINK>). One serious drawback of specialist psychological treatments is that they are time-consuming and costly and the increasing demand for treatment by far outstrips available resources. Many patients are unable to access specialist treatments or only with unacceptable delays, leading to unnecessary suffering and fostering the development of more chronic disorders. It is possible that self-help or guided self-help interventions, based on psychological treatments of proven efficacy, may be able to bridge this gap (<LINK REF="REF-Perkins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkins 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Self-help treatments aim to improve clinical outcome as well as provide information by teaching patients relevant skills to overcome and manage their health problem. They contain a longitudinal element and require the user to carry out tasks and then evaluate what has been achieved. Self-help treatments involve "the use of written materials or computer programmes or the listening/viewing of audio/video tapes for the purpose of gaining understanding or solving problems relevant to a person's developmental or therapeutic needs" (<LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>). Guided self-help treatments use these self-help materials in conjunction with minimal guidance by a health professional or lay person "to monitor progress, to clarify procedures, to answer general questions, or to provide general support or encouragement" (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1993</LINK>). A further definition of self-help is "the delivery of materials that employ a media based format to treatment such as book, computer or video tape. However delivered, self-help materials aim to increase the users' knowledge about a particular problem, and also equip them with skills to better self-manage their difficulties" (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). Self-help treatments can be used as a "stand-alone" treatment or in conjunction with other treatments (both psychological and pharmacological).</P>
<P>A number of potential advantages of using such self-help treatments have been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>):<BR/>1.They allow treatments with proven efficacy to be accessed with minimum delay.<BR/>2.They are popular and acceptable to many patients.<BR/>3.The price can be low.<BR/>4.Such treatments respect patient privacy and avoid the stigma or embarrassment of formal psychotherapy. In particular, patients with BN and BED are often very ashamed of their disorder and find it hard to confide in a therapist about their symptoms. <BR/>5.They allow patients to work in their own time and at their own pace. This is potentially important in eating disorders as patients are often anxious and depressed which may interfere with their ability to focus during a session with a therapist. <BR/>6.They empower the patient and promote collaboration.<BR/>7.They reinforce and consolidate learning. This is important in eating disorders as starvation-related deficits in attention and concentration may impair a patient's ability to benefit from "one-off" therapeutic interventions. <BR/>8.They allow patients to renew or update treatment as often as they wish, and at no extra cost. Given that BED and BN have a relapsing course this may be important to deal with setbacks.</P>
<P>As eating disorders are common and disabling disorders, early intervention is important but lack of resources means this is not always possible. Self-help interventions are potentially cost effective, accessible and well suited to eating disorders. Currently (to the best of our knowledge) there are no systematic reviews with a main focus on self-help in this area. Hay et al.'s Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2004</LINK>) "Psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa and bingeing" includes guided self-help and self-help as does the review carried out by the NICE guideline (<LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2004</LINK>) on eating disorders. However, the review does not cover other eating disorders, focuses mainly on binge eating as a key outcome, and is broader in its scope of therapy than this review intends. The recent NICE guideline also reviewed self-help treatments, but again is much broader in its scope than the present review.</P>
<P>The strategies for recruitment and settings from which patients are recruited for self-help treatments varies between studies and includes volunteers recruited through advertising, patients recruited from primary care or other non-specialist settings as well as patients attending specialist eating disorder services. The time and duration of therapeutic guidance given and the degree of sophistication of the person giving the guidance (e.g. 'lay person', mental health professional, CBT therapist, Eating Disorder specialist, Psychotherapist) also varies. The present review includes studies from all these different settings including self-help with or without guidance.</P>
<P>The current review therefore aims to investigate the efficacy of PSH and GSH in all eating disorders as compared to a) no treatment, b) attention/placebo control, c) other specific interventions (psychological and pharmacological). As eating disorders generally develop during early adolescence and may last through adulthood, often recurring over the course of a lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>), this review has incorporated trials of children, adolescents and adults. </P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>
<B>(1) Self-help interventions:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>(a) "Pure" self-help</B>
<BR/>For the purpose of this review, this is an intervention, which uses a clear model and structure of treatment, and itself includes all instructions on how the user can improve their skills to cope with and manage their difficulties. The material may be in any media i.e. book, CD-ROM, internet package etc; may be individual or group; psycho-education materials may be included depending on their goals i.e. to relieve symptoms vs. to improve knowledge.</P>
<P>
<B>(b) Guided self-help</B> <BR/>For the purpose of this review, this refers to the above self-help definition, plus contact with a 'therapist' who may be a mental health professional or lay person. This does not include: prevention and purely educational material; pure support groups (as they do not have improved clinical outcome as a direct goal); groups which do not focus their sessions on a recognisable tool e.g. book, CD-ROM, video; sessions where the emphasis is on the therapist leading the sessions and being present for most of the 'action'. No upper limit will be set for the number of hours which constitute guidance.</P>
<P>The comparison interventions:<BR/>(1) Waiting list <BR/>(2) Placebo/attention control (e.g. therapist contact without self-help material or other advice or specific intervention)<BR/>(3) Other formal psychological therapies<BR/>(4) Pharmacotherapy</P>
<P>In addition specific comparisons were made between:<BR/>(1) PSH versus GSH<BR/>(2) PSH/GSH versus self-help based on different therapeutic models (for example, cognitive-behavioural or behavioural).</P>
<P>Treatment comparisons: the following treatment comparisons were made to test the review hypotheses:<BR/>(1) PSH/GSH versus waiting list <BR/>(2) PSH/GSH versus placebo/attention control <BR/>(3) PSH/GSH versus other formal psychological therapies<BR/>(4) PSH versus GSH<BR/>(5) PSH/GSH combined with placebo vs psychopharmacological intervention<BR/>(6) PSH/GSH combined with psychopharmacological intervention vs psychopharmacological intervention alone<BR/>(7) PSH/GSH alone versus PSH/GSH combined with psychopharmacological intervention <BR/>(8) PSH/GSH type I (cognitive-behavioural) vs PSH/GSH type II (self-assertion - <LINK REF="STD-Carter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2003</LINK>; behavioural weight control - <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005b</LINK>)</P>
<P>Comparisons 1 and 3 are the primary comparisons. Comparisons 2 and 4 to 8 are the secondary comparisons.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>A range of outcome measures is available for assessing the effectiveness of treatment for AN, BN and BED consisting of physical, psychological and social elements. These were assessed at end of treatment and follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes </B>
<BR/>(a) Abstinence from bingeing.<BR/>(b) Abstinence from purging.<BR/>(c) Weight (body mass index, BMI). </P>

<B>2) Hand searching:</B>
<BR/>The following journal was hand searched by members of CCDAN:<BR/>The International Journal of Eating Disorders 1981 + </P>
<P>The following journals were also handsearched:<BR/>European Eating Disorders Review 1993 +<BR/>Eating Disorders: The Journal of Prevention and Treatment 1993 +<BR/>Eating and Weight Disorders: 1996 +</P>
<P>
<B>3) Grey Literature:</B>
<BR/>Grey literature including Conference Proceedings and databases of ongoing trials were searched. We have searched the conference proceedings of the Academy of Eating Disorders, the Eating Disorder Research Society and the London International Meeting on Eating Disorders for the past 10 years. Searches of ongoing trials databases were conducted by Hugh McGuire.</P>
<P>
<B>4) Reference searching</B>
<BR/>The reference lists of all papers selected were inspected for further relevant studies. <BR/>Social Sciences and Science Citation Index were searched for all included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>5) Personal contact</B>
<BR/>The first authors of all included studies and experts in the field were contacted for further information regarding published and unpublished trials (except <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Banasiak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Banasiak 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (US and SP) independently selected articles that met criteria for the systematic review through scrutiny of all the abstracts of papers found by the searches and which met criteria for inclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>Trials were assessed for their quality applying the 23-item quality rating scale from the Cochrane Collaboration Depression and Anxiety Group (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>; see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>for an outline of these items). These items assess factors contributing to the quality of a study and include for example, sample size, reporting of power calculations, methods of allocation and blinding. Authorship was not concealed at the point of data collection. Trials were evaluated for quality by two reviewers (US and SP) and discrepancies discussed until a consensus was reached. </P>
<P>Each study was assessed and the strength of its internal validity and statistical power evaluated. Particular attention was given to the length and depth of follow-up studies to identify whether any benefits claimed are robust. Where detailed, any treatment accessed by study participants outside of and in addition to the study treatment during the treatment or follow-up period was recorded and analysed as an outcome. </P>
<P>
<B>Data Extraction</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (US and SP) independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction form indicating the type and focus of the study, the sample size, outcome measures included in the study and results reported. Data was double-entered into the RevMan analysis program and any discrepancies discussed by the two reviewers. <BR/>Attempts were made to obtain data, which had not been included in published reports. The first authors were contacted via e-mail or letter explaining the purposes of the review and reasons for requesting the additional unreported data. In the event of no response within one month, a follow-up e-mail was sent. </P>
<P>
<B>Treatment outcomes</B>
<BR/>The main outcomes expected are changes in physical and psychological profiles. The main outcomes were changes in symptom levels as measured by rating scales and presented as either continuous (means and SDs) or dichotomous outcomes (abstinence from problematic behaviour or not). Data to be analyzed were both continuous and dichotomous as presented in candidate papers. </P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>Where a meta-analysis was appropriate on the basis of the studies available, the data was analysed using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences between the post-intervention values (end of treatment or follow-up) of the intervention and comparison groups were used to analyse the effect size of the interventions. Where results for continuous outcomes were presented on different scales, we used standardised mean differences. For dichotomous outcomes the effect sizes were expressed in terms of relative risk. Where possible we used an intention-to-treat analysis. All data were analysed with a random effects model. </P>
<P>
<B>Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity between trial results will be tested for using a standard chi-squared test. A significance level of alpha = 0.1 will be used for the test of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity is found, we will attempt to determine potential sources of heterogeneity with various subgroup and sensitivity analyses. </P>
<P>The following subgroup and sensitivity analyses were planned to determine potential sources of heterogeneity: </P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses</B>
<BR/>These are a series of analyses where the results of the meta-analysis are compared with trials included and excluded according to the following criteria:<BR/>(1) Size of trial - trials with &lt; 20 subjects in total and/or &lt;10 per group, will be removed.<BR/>(2) Allocation concealment gradings - sequential removal of trials graded 0 and 1.<BR/>(3) Unblinded trials removed sequentially.<BR/>(4) Trials which do not apply an intention-to-treat analysis will be removed.<BR/>(5) Trials which do not include a follow-up of a minimum of 6 months will be removed.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
<BR/>(1) Type, intensity of guidance and duration of the self-help intervention.<BR/>(2) Degree of specialization of guider: lay person/specialist in mental health/specialist in eating disorders/specialist in CBT.<BR/>(3) Age (17 and younger, 18 and above).<BR/>(4) Treatment setting: primary, secondary, tertiary.</P>
<P>However, there were insufficient studies to perform these analyses at this stage.</P>
<P>
<B>Publication bias</B>
<BR/>It was also planned to assess the possibility of publication bias using the Funnel Plot technique. Again, insufficient number of studies did not permit this.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Thirteen relevant RCTs and three CCTs were identified out of a pool of 91 studies generated by the search. All studies focused on BN (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bailer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bailer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>), BED (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005b</LINK>) or combinations of these and EDNOS (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghaderi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghaderi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Huon 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loeb-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treasure-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Treasure 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thiels 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Banasiak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Banasiak 2005</LINK>). All studies were done in adults. </P>
<P>All studies used manual-based self-help with manuals detailing CBT for BN or binge eating. Ten of these used the manual 'Overcoming binge eating' (<LINK REF="REF-Fairburn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairburn 1995</LINK>), three used 'Getting Better Bite by Bite' (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1993</LINK>) and two used another manual. Two studies compared an eating disorder specific CBT self-help manual against a manual with a different therapeutic focus (self-assertion - <LINK REF="STD-Carter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2003</LINK>; behavioural weight control - <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Six studies had at least one arm with PSH, the remainder evaluated GSH. The total amount of guidance ranged from 90 minutes to 8 hours with session duration ranging from 15 minutes to a full hour and number of sessions ranging from 4 to 18. People giving guidance included non-specialist facilitators without any clinical training (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1998</LINK>); psychology students (<LINK REF="STD-Ghaderi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghaderi 2003</LINK>); general nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2004</LINK>); junior psychiatrists (<LINK REF="STD-Bailer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bailer 2004</LINK>); doctoral level psychologists and research clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grilo-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Grilo 2005b</LINK>); psychotherapists (<LINK REF="STD-Thiels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thiels 1998</LINK>); specialist eating disorder therapists (Palmer et al., 2003), people fully or partially recovered from an eating disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Huon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Huon 1985</LINK>), general practitioners (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Banasiak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Banasiak 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Eight studies compared PSH/GSH to a waiting list or attention/placebo control group and seven studies compared PSH/GSH against another treatment.</P>
<P>Studies were conducted in a range of settings. Three studies were conducted in a primary care setting, one in a University setting, five in a secondary or tertiary eating disorder service, four recruited volunteers from the community and two did not describe their setting. Nine studies recruited all or some of their participants through advertisements from the community, one study recruited purely from primary care, the remainder recruited from specialist secondary or tertiary eating disorder services or used mixed recruitment strategies. Seven studies were from European countries, six from North America (USA or Canada) and two from Australia.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<B>Sample size</B>
<BR/>In thirteen studies, sample size was less than 50 participants per group and in two studies sample size was between 50-100 participants per group. No studies contained over 100 participants per group. </P>
<P>
<B>Details of power calculation</B>
<BR/>Thirteen studies did not report any a priori power calculation, one study mentioned this without providing details and only one provided a detailed power calculation.</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>Seven studies reported concealment of allocation code, the remainder did not report this.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of method of allocation</B>
<BR/>Twelve studies reported randomized allocation, with three studies reporting partial or quasi-randomisation with some bias possible (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Bailer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bailer 2004</LINK>: randomisation by groups of 8 to 12 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Thiels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thiels 1998</LINK>: alternate allocation; <LINK REF="STD-Huon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Huon 1985</LINK>; page 576): ' randomly assigned, with some adjustments so that the groups were comparable').</P>
<P>
<B>Blind assessment</B>
<BR/>Outcome assessors were kept blind in six studies but no test of blind was done in any of these. The remaining studies did either not keep assessors blind (n=5 studies) or did not report this (n=4 studies). </P>
<P>
<B>Duration of follow-up</B>
<BR/>Four studies reported no follow-up data. The duration of follow-up in the remaining studies ranged from 3 months to 18 months.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>Intention to treat analysis</B>
<BR/>This was done in twelve studies. In the three remaining studies this information was not available. </P>
<P>
<B>Total quality score</B>
<BR/>A total quality score on the 23-item quality checklist was calculated for each study. Denominators varied for psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy studies. Proportions of quality criteria met out of the total of possible criteria ranged from 0.38 to 0.83, with a median of 0.66. </P>

<B>(i) Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>Abstinence rates from bingeing (end of treatment: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09) and purging (end of treatment: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08) separately and combined (end of treatment: RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 11.84; follow-up: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25) did not differ significantly between groups. </P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The findings of this review suggest that self-help and guided self-help can be helpful in the treatment of eating disorders. </P>
<P>Compared to waiting list or attention/placebo treatment, PSH/GSH treatments for BN, BED and related disorders reduce eating disorder and some other symptoms (including psychiatric symptoms and interpersonal functioning) in the short-term; these effects are moderate but worthwhile, though do not extend to producing remission from key behavioural symptoms such as bingeing or vomiting. </P>
<P>No difference was found in outcome (abstinence from bingeing and purging, eating disorder symptomatology, levels of interpersonal functioning and depression) between GSH and formal therapist-delivered psychological therapy including individual CBT (two studies), group CBT (one study) and CBT or interpersonal therapy (one study). However, these analyses were likely to have been underpowered and all four studies included in this comparison were of moderate quality only and two studies were CCTs, potentially involving selection bias. Further studies comparing PSH/GSH with formal psychological therapies are needed. In line with Lewis et al.'s (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2003</LINK>) recommendations on research into self-help, there needs to be investigation of the effectiveness of PSH and GSH compared to the 'gold-standard' of CBT and in comparison to medication for BN and related disorders within adequately powered pragmatic trials in primary care and other non-specialist settings. Any such trial should include assessment of patients' views of and satisfaction with these treatments and a formal economic analysis, as these features have been missing from studies in this area.</P>
<P>No difference was found in outcome (eating disorder symptomatology, abstinence from bingeing and purging, BMI, proportion of dropouts, psychiatric and mental state symptomatology, level of interpersonal functioning, depression) between PSH and GSH. However, all studies included in this set of comparisons are small and almost certainly underpowered.</P>
<P>Only three small studies focused on comparisons of self-help with pharmacological interventions, studying different compounds and asking different questions. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn from these.</P>
<P>Finally, the two studies that compared self-help with a different therapeutic focus with eating disorder specific cognitive-behavioural self-help found some minor differences between them in terms of eating disorder symptomatology.</P>
<P>No study included a formal health economic analysis, with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2002</LINK>) giving limited information on total number of session attendances at the eating disorder service and three further studies addressing additional help-seeking during self-help treatment and follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treasure-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Treasure 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>No study assessed patient satisfaction with PSH/GSH compared to therapist-aided treatment. Very little is known about the characteristics of the people that are willing and able to follow and complete a course of self-help treatment. Different people might prefer different self-help media. Such information might enable clinicians to best predict which patients might have a better outcome with self-help treatment.</P>
<P>The mixed findings from the present review on PSH and GSH in eating disorders should be put into the context of what is known about use of PSH and GSH in other common mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The evidence base on self-help in these conditions is more substantial and includes a number of systematic reviews on manual-based and computerised self-help treatments. Depending on type of self-help treatments and comparison treatments used, populations studied and presence or absence of therapeutic guidance very different outcomes are achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-_x0028_in-press_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt (in press)</LINK>). Unsurprisingly opinion is still divided on what precisely the place is of self-help interventions in the treatment of these disorders. Likewise, in the field of eating disorders it is likely that a lot more evidence is needed to clarify the situation. </P>
<P>Methodological considerations<BR/>The fifteen studies included in this review have considerable heterogeneity in terms of the diagnostic mix of participants included and the source of recruitment of participants. Studies also differed markedly in terms of the amount of guidance given along-side a self-help manual, the expertise of the guide and the comparison interventions chosen. The sample size of the studies was typically small suggesting that many were underpowered. Only one study reported a power calculation in detail. Studies also differed markedly on all other indicators of quality. Of note, three studies were CCTs, vulnerable to selection bias.</P>
<P>Given the small number of studies in each comparison it was not possible to examine the source of the heterogeneity of studies further through the planned sensitivity or sub-group analyses as originally planned.Thus, any conclusions from this review have to be considered with caution. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Given that PSH/GSH treatments for BN, BED and related disorders compared to waiting list or attention control treatment reduce eating disorder and some other symptoms in the short-term, these treatments seem to have some utility as a first step in treatment. It remains uncertain whether and how much guidance is needed and from whom. Patients' preference and the availability of resources need to be taken into account here.</P>
<P>PSH/GSH interventions were not found to differ significantly from formal therapist-delivered psychological therapy on a number of outcomes, although these analyses are likely to be underpowered. However, there is some suggestion that self-help treatments could possibly be considered as an alternative to specialist therapist delivered therapies, again taking into account patient's preference and the availability of resources. </P>
<P>The relative efficacy of PSH/GSH compared to antidepressant or weight loss medication is as yet unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A number of major gaps remain in our knowledge. Lewis and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2003</LINK>) in a review on self-help for common psychiatric disorders made a number of research recommendations most of which are relevant to the area of self-help in eating disorders:</P>
<P>1. At present randomised controlled trials on self-help in eating disorders are based on manual-based treatments. Other media for delivering self-help need to be explored too. In particular, approaches using new technologies such as the internet, text messaging or CD-ROMs need to be researched further, as they are likely to be more interactive and hence may be more attractive to patients than manual-based approaches. </P>
<P>2. Nothing is as yet known about the use of self-help treatments in AN. Given that family-based approaches for the treatment of AN have successfully been translated into a manualised approach (<LINK REF="REF-Lock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 2001</LINK>) the development of self-help interventions for parents/families of young people with AN may also be fruitful. </P>
<P>3. None of the existing interventions have been developed for or studied in children and adolescents with eating disorders. Adolescents with BN and related disorders may well benefit from self-help treatment, either delivered by manual or the computer. However, it is likely that existing interventions need to be adapted to address the specific developmental needs of young people.</P>
<P>4. More research needs to be done into the extent and nature of guidance to support self-help, and the settings that might be best suited to ensure that self-help materials are effective.</P>
<P>5. More research needs to be done to address the question of what the "active" ingredients in self-help treatments are and whether self-help treatments based upon different therapeutic models are equally effective. </P>

<TITLE>search filter used to identify studies</TITLE>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The search filter used to identify studies of self-help is similar to the one we used in a protocol of media-based behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders and in a review of media-based behavioural treatments for behavioural problems in children. </P>
<P>Our additional searches for the review about anxiety disorders suggested that this filter may have excluded relevant RCTs involving self-help. To maintain sensitivity, we decided to remove the filter and check all RCTs about anxiety disorders indexed by CCDAN. </P>
<P>The review by Perkins and colleagues included other methods to identify relevant RCTs that are likely to have captured the vast majority of studies of self-help for eating disorders. We are not familiar with the eating disorders literature and we acknowledge that this filter may have captured all relevant RCTs. Nonetheless, our experience suggests that authors should consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity when using electronic filters to identify studies of self-help.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>We are grateful for your feed-back on our systematic review. We agree with your comment that there is a risk of studies being excluded where electronic filters are used.</P>
<P>However, we believe that there are important differences between your reviews and the one conducted by ourselves in terms of topic-area and scope that justify our use of a different search strategy to yours. </P>
<P>In terms of the topic area, self-help in eating disorders is a very recent phenomenon and interventions are all manualised, whereas this is not always the case in anxiety disorders. Generally, if an intervention is manualised it will be given a name which can then be indexed or used in the text. </P>
<P>There are also differences in the scope of your and our reviews. In our review the definition of self-help was quite specific and narrow. In contrast, your protocol is looking at all instances of self-help including any form of therapy where the client is giving reading material, making it harder to identify references. For instance, if a client is given 16 sessions of CBT, it will be identified in the paper and indexed as CBT or Cognitive Therapy even though it may include some sessions of exposure, some sessions of relaxation, some sessions of cognitive restructuring and some take-home reading material. </P>
<P>Thus, whilst on the face of it, your and our reviews cover near identical interventions, albeit in different disorders, and therefore it might seem as if the same caveats ought to apply vis--vis use of an electronic filter, we are reasonably confident for the reasons cited above, and as experts in the field, that we have identified all trials that ought to be included. In contrast, given the differences in topic areas and broader scope of your review, you have to be more sensitive in your search strategy.</P>
