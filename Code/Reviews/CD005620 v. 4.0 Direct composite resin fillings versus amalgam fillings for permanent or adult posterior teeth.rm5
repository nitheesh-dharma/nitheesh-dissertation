<TITLE MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:47:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">Tooth-colored resin fillings compared with amalgam fillings for permanent teeth at the back of the mouth</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:56:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, addressed the question of how effective tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are compared with conventional amalgam fillings when placed directly into cavities in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>There is controversy over the best materials to use when restoring or filling holes caused by tooth decay in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Amalgam fillings have been successfully used for over 150 years and are cost effective. However, their use has declined over recent years partly because of the way they look and because of the perceived risk of mercury that is used in them. Tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are frequently used in the front teeth and also in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 22 October 2013. We searched scientific databases and found seven studies to include in this review comparing composite resin fillings with amalgam fillings and we included two of these studies in the main analysis. There were 3265 composite fillings and 1935 amalgam fillings but is unclear how many children these were in. The exact age of participants was also unclear in some studies; however, both children and adults with permanent teeth at the back of the mouth that required fillings were included. Study centers were located in the UK, USA, Portugal, Sweden, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The main result including only two studies in 921 children suggests that amalgam fillings had lower failure rates than tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings used to fill holes caused by decay in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Further tooth decay (secondary caries) also occurred less frequently next to or under amalgam fillings compared with composite resin fillings. There was no evidence of a difference in the breaking of the two types of fillings.</P>
<P>The other five studies only reported the rate of failure of the fillings and the amount of further tooth decay occurring next to or under the fillings (secondary caries) and the results supported those of the two studies above.</P>
<P>The results suggest that tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are almost twice as likely to fail compared with amalgam fillings when used for filling permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. Because there was an obvious difference in the color of the fillings, it was not possible to do the comparisons 'blind' so there was, therefore, a high risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:40:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Amalgam has been the traditional material for filling cavities in posterior teeth for the last 150 years and, due to its effectiveness and cost, amalgam is still the restorative material of choice in certain parts of the world. In recent times, however, there have been concerns over the use of amalgam restorations (fillings), relating to the mercury release in the body and the environmental impact following its disposal. Resin composites have become an esthetic alternative to amalgam restorations and there has been a remarkable improvement of its mechanical properties to restore posterior teeth.</P>
<P>There is need to review new evidence comparing the effectiveness of both restorations.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:38:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To examine the effects of direct composite resin fillings versus amalgam fillings for permanent posterior teeth, primarily on restoration failure.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:40:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 22 October 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 22 October 2013), and LILACs via BIREME Virtual Health Library (1980 to 22 October 2013). We applied no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. We contacted manufacturers of dental materials to obtain any unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:43:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing dental resin composites with dental amalgams in permanent posterior teeth. We excluded studies having a follow-up period of less than three years.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:42:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-24 15:45:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Of the 2205 retrieved references, we included seven trials (10 articles) in the systematic review. Two trials were parallel group studies involving 1645 composite restorations and 1365 amalgam restorations (921 children) in the analysis. The other five trials were split-mouth studies involving 1620 composite restorations and 570 amalgam restorations in an unclear number of children. Due to major problems with the reporting of the data for the five split-mouth trials, the primary analysis is based on the two parallel group trials. We judged all seven trials to be at high risk of bias and we analyzed 3265 composite restorations and 1935 amalgam restorations.</P>
<P>The parallel group trials indicated that resin restorations had a significantly higher risk of failure than amalgam restorations (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.35, P value &lt; 0.001 (fixed-effect model) (low-quality evidence)) and increased risk of secondary caries (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.74, P value &lt; 0.001 (low-quality evidence)) but no evidence of an increased risk of restoration fracture (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.64, P value = 0.66 (moderate-quality evidence)). The results from the split-mouth trials were consistent with those of the parallel group trials.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of dental restorations were reported in two trials. The outcomes considered were neurobehavioral function, renal function, psychosocial function, and physical development. The investigators found no difference in adverse effects between composite and amalgam restorations. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as none of the outcomes were reported in more than one trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 14:15:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low-quality evidence to suggest that resin composites lead to higher failure rates and risk of secondary caries than amalgam restorations. This review reinforces the benefit of amalgam restorations and the results are particularly useful in parts of the world where amalgam is still the material of choice to restore posterior teeth with proximal caries. The review found insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects associated with amalgam or composite restorations. However, emerging research is highlighting issues around genetic susceptibility to mercury. The decision for a global phase-down of amalgam (Minamata Convention on Mercury) will restrict the future use of amalgam.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-24 16:13:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-24 16:07:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Dental caries (tooth decay) is a dynamic and continuous process composed of cycles of demineralization of the hard tissue of the teeth followed by cycles of remineralization. The balance between the two cycles determines the stage of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-ICDAS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICDAS 2011</LINK>). There is a close relationship between oral health and quality of life just as socioeconomic status and home environment have been shown to impact on people's oral condition (<LINK REF="REF-Gomes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paula-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paula 2012</LINK>). Despite the great accomplishments obtained globally in oral health, caries is still a serious problem particularly among under-privileged groups in low, middle and high-income countries, affecting 60% to 90% of school children and the vast majority of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2012</LINK>). It is also the most prevalent oral health problem in several Asian and Latin-American countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Modern management of dental caries involves making a diagnosis to determine the person's caries risk status, followed by the application of intervention strategies focused on preventing, arresting, and possibly reversing the caries process to delay restorative treatment until it becomes absolutely necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-Zandona-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira Zandona 2012</LINK>). When the damage on the tooth structure is permanent, the most commonly used treatment involves cleaning the cavity and filling it with a restorative material to restore the shape and function of the tooth.</P>
<P>Primary caries seems to be the most frequent reason for the placement of restorations (fillings) and caries lesions are most commonly found on occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Nascimento--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nascimento 2010</LINK>). Secondary caries is responsible for 60% of all replacement restorations in the typical dental practice but the association between the type of restoration materials and location of caries and the composition of the microflora has not been found to be statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Mo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mo 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-24 16:10:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The obturation and filling of occlusal cavities is an issue that has been long studied. The choice of the best material for restoring the anatomical structures that also achieves acceptable resistance to the forces of mastication is still controversial. This review compared dental amalgams and resin composites, the two main categories of dental restorative fillings used in posterior tooth restorations today.</P>
<P>Dental amalgams are metallic alloys. They have been predictable and inexpensive restorative materials for over 150 years. Their use and success rate have been well documented and they are the most cost-effective materials in posterior teeth restorations. However, they are declining in use in dentistry mainly due to their unesthetic appearance and concerns about their mercury content (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roulet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roulet 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dental resin composites were developed in response to people's demands for tooth-colored restorations. Dental resin composites are particle-reinforced resins. The indications of resin composites have expanded from anterior teeth to restrict posterior restorations and even to stress-bearing posterior restorations as amalgam substitutes or amalgam alternatives (<LINK REF="REF-Lutz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutz 1999</LINK>). Other advantages of dental resin composite restorations include their conservative design and reparability.</P>
<P>The cost of placing dental amalgams (USD 12.40) is only slightly cheaper than the cost of placing composite fillings (USD 15.90) for a single restoration provided in one dental session. However, when the costs are considered in the long term, taking into consideration the differences in longevity of the two materials, Sjögren et al. calculated that the estimated cost over 10 years for a Class II restoration was USD 189.80 for amalgam fillings and USD 363.70 for a composite filling (<LINK REF="REF-CADTH-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADTH 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-24 16:10:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Dental amalgam and resin composite restorations are still the most current selection for restoring permanent molar and premolar cavities. The choice of amalgam as the preferred material to restore posterior teeth has been gradually replaced by resin composite. However, surveys and retrospective studies developed by groups of practice-based researchers differ in their conclusions about which is the material most commonly used in restorative dentistry today (<LINK REF="REF-Makhija-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makhija 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nascimento--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nascimento 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years, the field of composite dental restoratives continues to propose and achieve significant and exciting advances in resin formulation, filler loading and modification, and curing methodologies and mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Cramer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramer 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current controversy is that amalgam restorations should be banned because of mercury toxicity. In addressing safety concerns, it is important to make the distinction between known and hypothetical risks (<LINK REF="REF-Rathore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathore 2012</LINK>). The truth is that a variety of potentially toxic compounds might be released from restorative dental materials (amalgam and composites) and can diffuse into the tooth pulp or gingiva reaching both saliva and circulating blood (<LINK REF="REF-Libonati-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libonati 2011</LINK>). Their adverse effects are not yet well known.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-24 16:13:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>While the use of dental amalgam has declined (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2007</LINK>) in some parts of the world, it is still the restorative material of choice in other parts of the world. The decline is due to concerns about its mercury release in the body and environmental impact following its disposal. To achieve a balance between the environment impact of the disposal of mercury products including amalgam and its public health benefit, the Minamata Convention on Mercury proposes a paced phase-down by national governments according to local needs (<LINK REF="REF-BDA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNEP-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNEP 2013</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) further iterates that the move from amalgam would depend on quality improvement of alternative restoration materials. Since the adhesive dentistry remains one of the fastest changing fields and will most likely continue well into the next decade (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2001</LINK>), there is need to provide a comprehensive update on the effects of composite materials in comparison with amalgam.</P>

<P>Two review authors undertook the assessment of risk of bias independently and in duplicate for each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed seven domains for each included study: sequence generation (selection bias), allocation sequence concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias. The risk of bias was assessed as 'low risk', 'high risk', or 'unclear risk', with the last category indicating either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias.</P>

<P>For each trial, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all pre-specified, dichotomous outcomes.

<P>We aimed to extract time-to-event data from each study in our review, if possible, and to express the treatment effect as a hazard ratio using survival analysis. If necessary, outcome data would have been transformed to achieve consistency of results (e.g. calculate survival rate as dichotomous data from time-to-event data at fixed time points).</P>

<P>Only a proportion of research projects conducted are ultimately published in an indexed journal and become easily identifiable for inclusion in systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>). Reporting biases arise when the reporting of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of the findings of the research. We attempted to avoid time lag bias, multiple (duplicate) publication bias, and language bias by conducting a detailed sensitive search, including searching for ongoing studies. We did not restrict the search by language and non-English studies were translated by co-review authors due to their multinationality.</P>

<P>We combined RRs for dichotomous data of the studies that were considered appropriate to be included in the meta-analysis. We intended to combine the treatment effects from split-mouth trials with those from parallel group trials where appropriate as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), but it was not possible because of poor reporting. Therefore, we treated the split-mouth trials as a subgroup so that the results could be examined either in isolation or in combination with the parallel group studies. This was particularly aimed at providing a broader view and 'bottom-line' to the review question. We used random-effects models where there were more than three studies in any meta-analysis, otherwise we used fixed-effect models.</P>

<P>The two parallel group studies reported data on two large RCTs that were developed to compare amalgam with composite to restore posterior teeth: The Casa Pia Study of Health Effects of Dental Amalgam in Children started in 1996 and was followed up for seven years (<LINK REF="STD-Casa-Pia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casa Pia 2007</LINK>), and The New England Children&#8217;s Amalgam Trial (NECAT) conducted between September 1997 and March 2005 (<LINK REF="STD-NECAT-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NECAT 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of the split-mouth studies reported data from a multicenter RCT designed for testing resin composite materials as a material suitable to restore posterior teeth, using amalgam restorations as positive control.

<P>We judged all the included studies to be at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). In most of the studies, bias was mainly due to lack of blinding.

<P>We found all the studies to be at high risk of performance bias and detection bias since the nature of the intervention (dental restorations) does not allow blinding for the operators or for the participants. Even though some studies indicated that outcome assessment was carried out by evaluators independent of the operators (<LINK REF="STD-Norman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Norman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1988</LINK>), we did not consider this to be sufficient to minimize detection bias.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 14:21:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the poor reporting of the split-mouth studies, which makes the reported data unreliable, we decided that the primary analysis should only include the two parallel group studies. We also undertook a secondary analysis of all included trials. We studied failure rate as the primary outcome, and secondary caries and fracture of the restoration as secondary outcomes. Psychosocial function, physical development, neurobehavioral assessments, and kidney function were considered to explore adverse effects of mercury release.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Failure rate</HEADING>
<P>The parallel group trials both recorded failure rate in the amalgam and composite group over a period of five to seven years. In total, 1365 amalgam restorations and 1645 composite restorations were analyzed. The pooled estimate showed that composite restorations had a significantly higher risk of failure than amalgam (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.35, P value &lt; 0.001; fixed-effect model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was indication of heterogeneity (P value = 0.005; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 87%), but, as there were only two studies, this could not be investigated. As the effect estimates for both studies were in the same direction, we decided to undertake the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis of the split-mouth studies also showed a similar trend with composite restorations having a higher risk of failure than amalgam restorations (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.11, P value = 0.23; random-effects model) (<I>note</I> fixed-effect model displayed in forest plot as primary result is for parallel group subgroup). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.57; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between the study design subgroups and the results of the parallel group and split-mouth trials when combined showed more precise results with composite restorations having a significantly higher risk of failure than amalgam restorations (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.4, P value = 0.009; random-effects model). There was some evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.05; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 52%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary caries</HEADING>
<P>Secondary caries was the most common reason for failure in the included studies. Meta-analysis of the parallel group studies showed a higher risk of secondary caries in permanent posterior teeth with composite restoration compared with teeth with amalgam restoration (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.74, P value &lt; 0.001; fixed-effect model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Once again there was evidence of heterogeneity (P value &lt; 0.001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 92%), but, as there were only two studies, this could not be investigated. As the effect estimates for both studies were in the same direction, we decided to undertake the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The outcome data from the split-mouth studies showed no significant difference in secondary caries when composite restorations were compared with amalgam restorations (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.97, P value = 0.7; random-effects model). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.64; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>The combined results of the parallel group and split-mouth trials indicated an increased risk of secondary caries for composite restorations (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.80, P value = 0.06; random-effects model). There was some evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.02; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 64%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fracture of the restoration</HEADING>
<P>Fracture of the restorations does not seem to be a common reason for failure in the studies reporting data on fracture. There was no evidence of a difference in risk of fracture between the two materials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.64, P value = 0.66; fixed-effect model). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.44; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis of subgroups</HEADING>
<P>One study reported failure rates separately in molars and premolars (<LINK REF="STD-Casa-Pia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casa Pia 2007</LINK>), but the results were not sufficient to determine whether there was an association between location of the restorations in different teeth and failure rate of restorations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Casa-Pia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casa Pia 2007</LINK> presented trial results on the effects of mercury on the nervous system and the potential damage to the renal system in children. Some tests were carried out at baseline and at seven years after a filling placement, to explore intelligence, nerve conduction velocity, memory, attention, and visuomotor function (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). To study renal function, creatinine-adjusted urinary albumin levels were recorded at years one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). According to the results, there was no statistically significant differences in measures of memory, attention, visuomotor function, or nerve conduction velocities. There were no significant group differences in creatinine-adjusted urinary albumin over the seven years of follow-up. A re-analysis of the data published in 2011, based on amalgam size and years of exposure, found a significant association between amalgam and the porphyrin biomarkers for mercury-related enzyme blockage, which suggests amalgams are a significant contributor to mercury body burden. A further investigation of a subgroup of children with genotyping assays demonstrated a genetic susceptibility to the adverse neurobehavioral effects of mercury exposure in children, predominantly in boys. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-NECAT-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NECAT 2007</LINK> trial focused on the effect of restorations on psychosocial function (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and physical development (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) in children after five years of follow-up. The effect of restorations on psychosocial function was measured using two validated instruments: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) parent report and Behaviour Assessment for Children Self Report (BASC-SR). The degree of exposure to restorations was expressed in surface years (SY); however, no direct comparison was made between children in the composite and amalgam arm. The BASC-SR measured emotional symptoms, clinical maladjustment, school maladjustment, personal adjustment, and core syndromes such as anxiety, depression, attitude to school, and interpersonal relations. The CBCL measured competence, total problem behaviors, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and core syndromes such as attention problems, withdrawal, anxiety/depression, delinquent behaviors, and aggression.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that greater exposure to composite restorations was associated with impaired psychosocial function in children whereas no adverse psychosocial outcomes were observed with greater amalgam treatment levels. No between-group comparison was reported.</P>
<P>The growth outcomes considered were body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI) and height. There were no statistically significant differences in physical development in children given composite and amalgam restorations.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-25 14:03:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We meta-analyzed seven trials reporting outcome data on failure rate, secondary caries, fracture of restoration, and adverse effects. However, due to the poor reporting and analysis of the data from the split-mouth studies, only evidence from the two parallel group trials are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> to inform this review. The results of the two parallel group trials suggest that composite restorations are almost twice at risk of failing, and for having secondary caries compared with amalgam restorations. There was no evidence of a difference in fracture rates between amalgam and composite restorations. Though the evidence from the two trials may be considered insufficient, they are supported by five additional split-mouth trials, which found similar results on all three outcomes. While the results of the two parallel group trials showed greater effect size, they were less precise than the pooled estimate of all seven trials. As none of the adverse effects were reported in more than one study, the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 14:18:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared resin composite restorations with amalgam restorations in permanent posterior teeth. Follow-up period ranged between three and seven years. We reported outcome results on failure rate, secondary caries, fracture of restorations, and adverse effects in this review. The event of a failure is reported rather than the non-event of survival. There was a limited number of studies reporting on adverse effects associated with either amalgam or compostie restorations, and the generalisability of the findings from these trials to populations other than healthy children (e.g children or adults with potential mercury-sensitive health conditions such as chronic kidney disease) is unclear. In addition, there is recent emerging research looking into genetic susceptibility to the adverse neurological effects of mercury exposure in children with effects manifested predominantly among boys. It is acknowledged that in order to complete a comprehensive systematic review of adverse events, observational studies would need to be included.This was not the focus of this review; only adverse events identified in the included trials have been reported.</P>
<P>We found insufficient outcome data on the cost of restorations, therefore, this outcome was not covered in the review.</P>
<P>The dental material industry is continuously evolving and improving the products that clinicians use. Most of the included studies were conducted in the 1990s. Some of the materials used in the studies included for the review may no longer be in use or may have been replaced by products with better mechanical properties and better resistance to wear, shrinkage, and fracture. In that case, the results of this review may not be a true reflection of the quality of new restorations that are currently in use.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-25 14:04:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The body of evidence is based on the results of two parallel group RCTs (involving 1006 participants and 3010 restorations) supported by an additional five split-mouth RCTs. Evidence on failure rate and secondary caries were assessed as low quality due to high risk of bias and inconsistency while evidence on fracture of restoration was of moderate quality. High risk of bias was due to lack of blinding and allocation concealment. Differences in oral hygiene may have contributed to the inconsistency observed with the failure rate and secondary caries outcomes owing to age differences of participants in both trials (mean age 7.9 and 10.2 years). Inconsistency may have also resulted from the difference in adhesives used for composite restoration in the studies. The trial that found an association between composite restoration and impaired psychosocial function had reported that participants received additional composite restoration in cases where any anterior teeth needed restoration. This may have amplified the effects of composite restoration on psychosocial function.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-25 14:04:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>There were units of analysis issues with all the studies as even the parallel group studies had more than one filling per person, and the data were analyzed without taking into account the clustering. This will mean that the confidence intervals for the effect estimates were smaller than they should be, but this effect will be very small. The effect for the split-mouth studies is unknown as there is lack of clarity in their reporting and this is why they have not been included in the primary analysis.</P>

However, in the two studies in <LINK REF="REF-CADTH-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADTH 2012</LINK> presenting efficacy data, the duration of follow-up was inadequate for inclusion in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-21 14:19:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low-quality evidence to suggest that resin composites lead to higher failure rates and risk of secondary caries than amalgam restorations. This review reinforces the benefit of amalgam restorations and the results are particularly useful in parts of the world where amalgam is still the material of choice to restore posterior teeth with proximal caries. The review found insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects amalgam or composite restorations may have on patients. However, emerging research is highlighting issues around genetic susceptibility to mercury. The decision for a global phase-down of amalgam (Minamata Convention on Mercury) will restrict the future use of amalgam.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-25 14:05:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This review indicates that there are higher failure rates with resin composite than amalgam restorations. The included studies date back to 2007 and composite dental restorative materials have advanced considerably since then. Since the proposed discontinuation of use of amalgam depends on quality improvement of non-mercury-based alternative restorative materials (<LINK REF="REF-BDA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDA 2013</LINK>), there is need for continued focus on new research demonstrating the long-term effectiveness of the latest improved composite materials, techniques, and instruments for placing them. If future studies use a split-mouth design then it is imperative that the data are analyzed and reported appropriately taking the clustering of sites within participants into account (<LINK REF="REF-Lesaffre-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesaffre 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>The participant inclusion criterion in the protocol was originally restricted to adults and adolescents. Tooth type (permanent posterior teeth) was considered more important as a criterion than age group, therefore, studies on children were included. Only data on permanent posterior teeth were reported in this review.</P>
<P>Participant satisfaction could not be analyzed as none of the randomized controlled trials had data about this variable.</P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness could not be calculated because of partial reporting.</P>
<P>In the protocol, survival rate was listed as the primary outcome but the review lists failure rate as primary outcome. Failure rate is reported in this review as a proxy for survival rate.</P>
<P>We aimed to minimize potential reporting biases including publication bias, time lag bias, multiple (duplicate) publication bias, and language bias by constructing a funnel plot. However, we were unable to achieve this since we had fewer than 10 studies.</P>
<P>Only dichotomous data were available.</P>
<P>The review used random-effects models unless there were fewer than four studies, when fixed-effect models were used, as this is general policy for the Cochrane Oral Health Group. The protocol stated random-effects models only.</P>

<P>Sample size calculation: selected to ensure adequate power for detecting 2 potential scenarios</P>
<P>The first scenario was a small but near-uniform effect of 0.3 SD for the 3 neurobehavioral outcomes, and half of that (0.15 SD) for the nerve conduction outcome. The effect size of 0.3 SD represents a shift that would cause the proportion of abnormally low values in a normally distributed population to increase from 2.5% to 5.0%, thus doubling the proportion classified as abnormally low<BR/>For the second scenario, a potential effect in only 1 of the 4 outcomes was of interest, so an effect size of 0.5 SD in the nerve conduction outcome was used, with no effects in the others<BR/>A sample size of 400 (200 in each group) through 5 years of follow-up provided adequate power (97%) to detect both scenarios</P>
