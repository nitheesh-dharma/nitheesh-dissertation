<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-15 10:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent chest pain in the absence of coronary artery disease is a common, difficult to treat problem that sometimes leads to excess use of medical care. A substantial number of patients are not reassured by negative medical assessment, reporting persistent pain and limitations. Psychological factors appear to be of importance for treatment. This Cochrane review included all studies of psychotherapy for non-cardiac chest pain. Seventeen trials met the inclusion criteria, and included a total of 1006 participants. The review found that cognitive-behavioural treatments are probably effective (in terms of reduced chest pain frequency) in the short term, for the treatment of non-cardiac related chest pain. No adverse effects of the psychotherapy were found. Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative. A limitation of this review is the high variability of the studies included, reflected in a wide range of outcome measures, although there was an overall fairly low risk of bias.</P>

<P>Recurrent chest pain in the absence of coronary artery disease is a common problem which sometimes leads to excess use of medical care. Although many studies have examined the causes of pain in these patients, few clinical trials have evaluated treatment. This is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2005 and last updated in 2010. The studies reviewed in this paper provide an insight into the effectiveness of psychological interventions for this group of patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-05-17 15:31:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of psychological interventions for chest pain, quality of life and psychological parameters in people with non-specific chest pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-05-17 16:14:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, Issue 4 of 12, 2014 and DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2014), MEDLINE (OVID, 1966 to April week 4 2014), EMBASE (OVID, 1980 to week 18 2014), CINAHL (EBSCO, 1982 to April 2014), PsycINFO (OVID, 1887 to April week 5 2014) and BIOSIS Previews (Web of Knowledge, 1969 to 2 May 2014). We also searched citation lists and contacted study authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-17 15:32:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with standardised outcome methodology that tested any form of psychotherapy for chest pain with normal anatomy. Diagnoses included non-specific chest pain (NSCP), atypical chest pain, syndrome X or chest pain with normal coronary anatomy (as either inpatients or outpatients).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-15 10:28:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality of studies. We contacted trial authors for further information about the included RCTs.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 04:36:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included two new papers, one of which was an update of a previously included study. Therefore, a total of 17 RCTs with 1006 randomised participants met the inclusion criteria, with the one new study contributing an additional 113 participants. There was a significant reduction in reports of chest pain in the first three months following the intervention: random-effects relative risk = 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92). This was maintained from three to nine months afterwards: relative risk 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.76). There was also a significant increase in the number of chest pain-free days up to three months following the intervention: mean difference (MD) 3.00 (95% CI 0.23 to 5.77). This was associated with reduced chest pain frequency (random-effects MD -2.26, 95% CI -4.41 to -0.12) but there was no evidence of effect of treatment on chest pain frequency from three to twelve months (random-effects MD -0.81, 95% CI -2.35 to 0.74). There was no effect on severity (random-effects MD -4.64 (95% CI -12.18 to 2.89) up to three months after the intervention. Due to the nature of the main interventions of interest, it was impossible to blind the therapists as to whether the participant was in the intervention or control arm. In addition, in three studies the blinding of participants was expressly forbidden by the local ethics committee because of issues in obtaining fully informed consent . For this reason, all studies had a high risk of performance bias. In addition, three studies were thought to have a high risk of outcome bias. In general, there was a low risk of bias in the other domains. However, there was high heterogeneity and caution is required in interpreting these results. The wide variability in secondary outcome measures made it difficult to integrate findings from studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-15 10:28:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane review suggests a modest to moderate benefit for psychological interventions, particularly those using a cognitive-behavioural framework, which was largely restricted to the first three months after the intervention. Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative. However, these conclusions are limited by high heterogeneity in many of the results and low numbers of participants in individual studies. The evidence for other brief interventions was less clear. Further RCTs of psychological interventions for NSCP with follow-up periods of at least 12 months are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-27 03:29:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chest pain is one of the most frequent reasons for people's presentation to emergency services. Of patients admitted to the emergency department for chest pain, more than half are discharged with a diagnosis of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) or chest pain of unknown cause (<LINK REF="REF-Capewell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capewell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knockaert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knockaert 2002</LINK>). Non-specific chest pain (NSCP) accounts for between 2% to 5% of all admissions to the emergency department (<LINK REF="REF-Eslick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eslick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knockaert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knockaert 2002</LINK>). Approximately 50% of new referrals to outpatient cardiac clinics with the presenting complaint of chest pain are found to have a non-cardiac basis for their pain (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). The reported prevalence of NCCP in the community ranges from 23% to 33% (<LINK REF="REF-Eslick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eslick 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eslick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eslick 2003</LINK>). While various causes have been proposed, including microvascular coronary artery disease, coronary spasm, chest wall pain, oesophageal dysmotility or reflux, hyperventilation, panic disorder and general anxiety, many patients are given a non-specific diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). In all groups of patients there is some association with psychiatric disorder, although the importance of this varies according to diagnosis.</P>
<P>Chest pain with normal coronary anatomy and no clear physical cause has been described by a number of terms including NSCP, NCCP, atypical chest pain, syndrome X or chest pain with normal coronary anatomy. Syndrome X refers to a triad of angina pectoris, positive exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) for myocardial ischaemia and angiographically smooth coronary arteries (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2005a</LINK>). In this Cochrane review we will use the term NSCP. Most NSCP studies are concerned with outpatients with normal coronary angiograms whose chest pain is chronic. In one study, 61% of patients with NSCP had psychiatric symptoms on structured interview (the Clinical Interview Schedule), compared with 23% of patients with abnormal coronary arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Bass-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bass 1984</LINK>). The respective figures for NSCP and coronary heart disease in another study using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule were 43% and 6.5% for panic disorder, 36% and 4% for major depression, and 36% and 15% for phobias (<LINK REF="REF-Katon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katon 1988</LINK>). These proportions are much higher than in patients with coronary heart disease, although a possible confounding factor may have been the chronic nature of the NSCP.</P>
<P>There have been similar findings in inpatients. In one study of consecutive admissions to a coronary intensive care unit, 55% of patients with NSCP (n = 27) had panic disorder compared with 11% of those with coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1992a</LINK>). There was a similar but non-significant association between major depression and NSCP (22%) as opposed to coronary heart disease (11%).</P>
<P>The prognosis of patients with NSCP varies with the outcome measure. In contrast to patients with coronary disease, the incidence of myocardial infarction or death in patients with chest pain and normal cardiac arteriography is very low in most long-term studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1990</LINK>). In terms of functional disability, approximately 75% of patients continue seeing a physician, 50% remain or become unemployed, and 50% regard their lives as significantly disabled. Fewer than 50% of NSCP patients appear reassured that they do not have serious heart disease. Most continue to report residual chest pain during follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of possible mechanisms for NSCP have been suggested. These include hyperventilation (<LINK REF="REF-DeGuire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeGuire 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>) or panic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Mayou-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayou 1989b</LINK>) and an association with alcohol and cigarette use (<LINK REF="REF-Kisely-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 1997</LINK>), possibly mediated through changes in oesophageal motility (<LINK REF="REF-Kahrilas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahrilas 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsuguchi-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuguchi 1984</LINK>). Other potential mechanisms are less clear. There may be an interaction in which psychological factors affect the interpretation of physiological perceptions, which in turn worsen mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1990</LINK>). In addition, recent life events as measured by a structured interview or personality factors, such as an excess of Type A behaviour (hard driving and competitive behaviour, a potential for hostility, pronounced impatience and vigorous speech stylistics (<LINK REF="REF-Hemingway-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemingway 1999</LINK>)), have been identified as occurring more frequently in patients with NSCP compared with physically healthy controls matched for age and sex (<LINK REF="REF-Roll-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roll 1987</LINK>). In addition, the presence of pain is associated with increased psychiatric morbidity, including psychophysiological symptoms other than pain, thus exacerbating the problem (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 1988</LINK>). Chest pain forms part of the spectrum of medically unexplained symptoms, the exact presenting features varying by specialty. For instance, the equivalent for NCCP in cardiology would be irritable bowel syndrome in gastroenterology or fibromyalgia in rheumatology (<LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment is known to be difficult (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>). Some patients are reassured by negative medical assessment, but a substantial number report persistent pain and limitations. A variety of drugs have been used including anti-secretory drugs, anxiolytics, antidepressants, nitrates and calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2001</LINK>). As cognitions are of aetiological importance in NSCP and with high levels of psychiatric co-morbidity, psychological approaches have been suggested as appropriate interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bass-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bass 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ockene-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ockene 1980</LINK>) as early intervention might help prevent the pain becoming chronic. Such approaches generally use a behavioural framework and include an explanation of the nature of the pain, treatment of anxiety or depression, and cognitive behavioural psychotherapy.</P>
<P>The exact contributions to a successful outcome are unknown. Given the wide range of behavioural treatments in use, any systematic review would have to include a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis would identify any dilution of findings in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Both cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy are effective in treating anxiety and depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1994</LINK>). CBT is effective in the treatment of patients with unexplained physical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Speckens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speckens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 2008</LINK>) and chronic fatigue syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Price-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1996</LINK>). Previous versions of this review indicated modest to moderate benefit for psychological interventions, particularly those using a cognitive-behavioural framework, which was largely restricted to the first three months after the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2010</LINK>). This is consistent with findings for other types of medically unexplained symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Kroenke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kroenke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the large number of people living with chest pain and the high prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity, it is important to identify psychological interventions that may alleviate such symptoms. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cognitive behavioural therapy</HEADING>
<P>For the purposes of this Cochrane review, we based CBT on <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>'s definition. In order to be classified as 'well defined' the intervention must clearly demonstrate the following components:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The intervention involves the recipient establishing links between their thoughts, feelings and actions with respect to the target symptom;</LI>
<LI>The intervention involves the correction of the person's misperceptions, irrational beliefs and reasoning biases related to the target symptom;</LI>
<LI>The intervention should involve either or both of the following:</LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>the recipient monitoring his or her own thoughts, feelings and behaviours with respect to the target symptom;</LI>
<LI>the promotion of alternative ways of coping with the target symptom.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>All therapies that did not meet these inclusion criteria and were described as 'CBT' or 'cognitive therapy' were labelled as 'less-well defined' CBT. We established the exact nature of 'less-well defined' therapies by contacting study authors.</P>
<P>We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the primary outcomes (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>) of this Cochrane review to determine whether there was a difference based on the 'well-defined' or 'less-well defined' classification of CBT.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Relaxation therapy</HEADING>
<P>Relaxation therapy consists of alternating tension and relaxation of various muscle groups (<LINK REF="REF-Woolfolk-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolfolk 1983</LINK>). Some studies have added imagery to the relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Borkovec-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkovec 1982</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hyperventilation control</HEADING>
<P>Hyperventilation control techniques consist of an explanation of how hyperventilation can contribute to symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-DeGuire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeGuire 1992</LINK>). Control of hyperventilation can be achieved by holding the breath for 20 seconds and then breathing on a six-second cycle (10 breaths per minute). Breathing should be as light as possible and preferably diaphragmatic. Additional relief can be obtained from either breathing into cupped hands or into a re-breathing bag for one to two minutes every five minutes until symptoms abate (<LINK REF="REF-QAP-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">QAP 1982</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies for inclusion/exclusion</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (SK, LAC) independently selected suitable studies for inclusion in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2005</LINK>), as detailed below. For the review updates, SK and AP performed this. Where the two review authors disagreed about the inclusion of a study, we resolved disagreements by consensus of opinion, and consulted a third review author if disagreements could not be resolved. Where resolution was not possible we contacted the trial authors to obtain more information and clarification.</P>
<P>We assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by searching electronic databases to determine whether each article met the eligibility criteria. In order to prevent any bias, we printed a list of all titles and abstracts and excluded the author names, institutions and journal title. If the title and abstract contained sufficient information to determine that the article did not meet the inclusion criteria, then it was rejected. We recorded all rejected papers and the reasons for rejection. We scanned the reference lists of all relevant papers for published reports, conference abstracts and citations of unpublished research.</P>
<P>We retrieved the full papers of all remaining titles and abstracts deemed relevant. Also we reviewed all other potentially relevant articles identified by the various search strategies (reference checking, personal communications etc). Two review authors independently assessed all articles, who completed a form for each study and scored the quality of the research as defined below. We documented the reasons for exclusion. Where the same study had more than one article written about the outcomes, we treated all articles as one study and presented the results only once.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We prepared a 'Risk of bias' table for any new articles included in this update. The 'Risk of bias' table included random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and selective reporting (reporting bias) using the methodology described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Losses to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Ideally, included papers should have given an adequate description of the loss of its participants in terms of the number of withdrawals, dropouts and protocol deviations. In the protocol for this review we stated that we would only include RCTs where &lt; 20% of participants originally randomised were lost to follow-up. In view of the limited number of trials, we relaxed these criteria to include studies that combined RCT and cross-over designs, and those that had greater losses to follow-up. In each case, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of the inclusion of these studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Addressing publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Where there were more than 10 studies in an analysis, we entered data into a funnel plot (size of study versus effect size) (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), to detect the possibility of publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (SK and LAC or AP) completed a data extraction form for each included study to elicit the following information:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>General: published/unpublished, title, authors, source, contact address, country, language of publication, year of publication, duplicate publications, sponsoring, setting (hospital inpatients or outpatients, primary care, community);</LI>
<LI>Trial characteristics: design, duration, randomisation and method, allocation concealment and method, blinding of outcome assessors, check of blinding;</LI>
<LI>Interventions (frequency, timing), comparison interventions, co-medications;</LI>
<LI>Patient characteristics - sampling, exclusion criteria number of participants, age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, educational status, duration of symptoms, number of complications, mode of referral (e.g. self-referral or via psychiatrists, psychologists, or other clinicians), similarity of groups at baseline (including any co-morbidity), withdrawals/losses to follow-up (reasons/descriptions), history of myocardial infarction (MI);</LI>
<LI>Type of intervention - CBT, psychotherapy, 'talking/counselling' therapy, no intervention versus psychological intervention; usual care versus psychological intervention; and 'attention' placebo versus psychological intervention; timing of intervention (early vs late);</LI>
<LI>Type of outcomes - level of chest pain at baseline, and at subsequent follow-ups, psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, number of hospital re-admissions, non-fatal cardiovascular events, reduction of cardiovascular behavioural risk factors, death (cardiovascular and all-cause mortality), and health beliefs;</LI>
<LI>Type of psychiatric outcome - clinical diagnosis or symptomatology assessed by questionnaire;</LI>
<LI>Type of assessment tool used to assess psychiatric outcome - e.g. BDI, Zung Depression Scale, HADS, Structured interview, DSM-IV criteria;Cut-off used on psychiatric scale, percentage of people defined as psychiatric cases on this basis; mean (SD) symptom score;</LI>
<LI>Duration of follow-up and point from which follow-up was calculated start or end of intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We stated that we would group outcomes into short term (within 12 weeks of the start of therapy), medium term (between 13 to 24 weeks after the beginning of therapy) and long-term (more than 24 weeks after the start of therapy). As interventions varied in length from one session to treatment lasting three months, we used time from the end of intervention to ensure that comparison between treatments were appropriate (i.e. an assessment made six months after baseline assessment and a three month course of treatment is the equivalent of three months after initial assessment for an intervention lasting a few days). Using this methodology, it was only possible to divide outcomes into those within three months of the end of the intervention (or the equivalent time for controls), and those from three to 12 months after the intervention (or the equivalent time for controls). Only one study reported data on ten participants at 36 month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data entry</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (SK and LAC or AP) independently entered data into <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>. We reported a summary of data extracted from included studies. If studies were available that were sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality we pooled those that could be grouped together and meta-analysed the data. We synthesised the data using MetaView within <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data types</HEADING>
<P>We assessed outcomes using continuous (e.g. changes on depression scales), categorical (e.g. one of three categories on a quality of life scale, such as 'better', 'worse' or 'no change') or dichotomous (e.g. either depressed or not-depressed) measures.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>Many rating scales are available to measure outcomes in psychological trials. These scales vary in the quality of their validation and reliability. Therefore, if validation of a rating scale was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, then we did not include the data in this Cochrane review. In addition, the rating scale should either be self-reported or completed by an independent observer or relative. Trials that used the same instrument to measure specific outcomes were used in direct comparisons where possible. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, we presented both sets of data and inspected the general direction of the effect. We reported the mean and standard deviation (SD). Where SDs were not reported in the paper, we attempted to obtain them from the trial authors or to calculate them using other reported measures of variation, such as the confidence intervals (CIs). We pooled data from different scales rating the same outcome using the standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>We converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data where it was necessary to combine these with dichotomous outcomes. If the trial authors used a designated cut-off point for determining clinical effectiveness we used this where appropriate. Otherwise, we identified cut-offs on rating scales and divided participants on the basis of whether they were 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. For dichotomous outcomes, we estimated a risk ratio with its associated 95% CIs. As a summary measure of effectiveness, where possible we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT).</P>
<P>Initially we compared any psychological intervention to any control. Depending on the number of included studies, we compared each intervention category with any control, and also subgroup according to type of control. We investigated the effect of different approaches using sensitivity analyses (see below).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>When we inspected graphical representations of the data, if the CIs of the study results did not overlap, we deemed the differences were likely to be statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1988</LINK>). In addition, we checked the differences between the results of each included trial using a test of heterogeneity. As these tests usually have low statistical power, we used a type I error level of 0.10 rather than the customary 0.05 for rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity. We analysed the results using both fixed-effect and random-effects methods. However, where there was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic &gt; 50%), we only used a random-effects model. We attempted to explore the reasons for this heterogeneity in post hoc analyses of omitting each study in turn where there were more than two studies. However, we reported both fixed-effect and random-effects models when there was no statistical heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions and analysis</HEADING>
<P>Comparisons of psychological interventions included CBT, hypnotherapy, autogenic training, group support, brief intervention by a nurse, relaxation training and breathing re-training. Only two studies evaluated a group intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>). Two studies used a combined randomised controlled and crossover design where participants in the control groups were offered the active treatment after the initial controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>). In one trial, control participants were given an initial behavioural explanation of their symptoms before being placed on the wait-list. Although both studies reported some data of the RCT component, many of the reported outcomes combined the results of the RCT and crossover designs. Where it was not possible to find data of the RCT alone, we conducted sensitivity analyses including and excluding combined data. In the other studies, control participants were offered assessment only combined with either usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Tyni_x002d_Lenne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tyni-Lenne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>) or no care (<LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). In the case of the former, no information was reported on details of usual care the controls received. Where studies had more than two arms (<LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyni_x002d_Lenne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tyni-Lenne 2002</LINK>), we used the control treatment that most readily allowed comparison with other studies. For <LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK> we used guided re-breathing training without physiological monitoring of diaphragmatic breathing or end-tidal CO<SUB>2</SUB>. For <LINK REF="STD-Tyni_x002d_Lenne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tyni-Lenne 2002</LINK>, we used relaxation as opposed to physical training. It was not possible to examine differences in the timing of the interventions. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>, there were four study arms: 1) placebo; 2) psychological treatment and placebo; 3) sertraline and placebo; and 4) sertraline plus psychological treatment. We used the results of the first two arms. Six of the 15 studies did not described timing of the intervention (early vs. late). One study examined the differences between "immediate" and "delayed" interventions, but as per the inclusion criteria, participants may have had an angiogram within the past year (<LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK> conducted the intervention while the patient was in the emergency room, but did not provide information regarding a history of chest pain. Therefore, it is unclear whether the patients were presenting for the first time or not. Therapist training was not noted in four of the studies. Nine studies described adherence to a treatment manual or plan. <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK> also assessed fidelity. Therapists met weekly for supervision with a senior psychologist who reviewed audiotapes of the sessions and provided feedback regarding treatment quality and adherence to the study protocol.</P>

All studies were of outpatients who were either referred by treating physicians or GPs, or undergoing coronary angiography. One study, <LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>, included participants who responded to a newspaper advertisement. A sensitivity analysis excluding this study made no difference to the results. All included participants whose main symptom was chest pain and who had been investigated to some degree to exclude cardiac explanations for their pain. Only one study excluded participants who had other co-morbid medical conditions, such as diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Tyni_x002d_Lenne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tyni-Lenne 2002</LINK>).

In most cases, only 40% to 60% agreed to participate. <LINK REF="STD-Lahmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lahmann 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK> were the only exceptions, where 90% of eligible subjects participated.

<P>All included studies reported change in frequency and severity of chest pain except one (<LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK>). Some also included the number of days when participants were free of chest pain. Studies reported a wide range of other outcomes covering psychological morbidity, quality of life, health beliefs and service use. Both observer-rated and self-report measures were included.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Follow-up periods varied from three to 36 months. Studies generally dated follow-up from baseline intervention rather than the end of the intervention. Duration of interventions varied from a single session, to a few days or several months. We calculated duration from follow-up from the end of the intervention. For example, we classified a trial in which participants were followed up for six months dated from baseline intervention, with an intervention duration of three months as followed up for three months.</P>

<P>We excluded 58 papers from 55 studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

The fifth trial pooled data from 90 patients with mitral valve prolapse with 14 participants with NSCP (<LINK REF="STD-Cott-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cott 1992</LINK>). We tried to contact the study authors to determine whether there were any data restricted to patients with NSCP.

<P>We created a 'Risk of bias' table for the new trial identified in this update, as well as those added in previous revisions. In ten studies there was a low risk of random sequence generation and/or selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonsbu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsbu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK>). In seven, there was unclear risk for both of these biases (<LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyni_x002d_Lenne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tyni-Lenne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lahmann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>). In studies where there was a medical aspect to the intervention, the patients were blinded to medication or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>). However, due to the nature of the main interventions of interest (normally counselling or CBT), it was impossible to blind the people delivering the treatment as to whether the participant was in the intervention or control arm. In addition, in three studies the blinding of participants was expressly forbidden by the local ethics committee because of issues in obtaining fully informed consent (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>). For this reason, we considered all studies to be at high risk of performance bias. As outcomes were largely assessed by self-reports, and the patients were at least in part not blinded to the intervention, we judged most studies at high risk of outcome assessment bias. One exception was <LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK>, which assessed disease severity with the Clinical Global Inventory (CGI) rated by a blinded independent rater. Most studies did not discuss intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, but most studies appeared to have analysed data based on ITT analysis. We considered three studies to be at high risk of outcome bias because of a high loss or differential loss from baseline to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK>). The other trials were at low risk of bias for this domain. Two studies had unclear risk of selective reporting because they did not clearly state the outcomes of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Lahmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lahmann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Absence of chest pain</HEADING>
<P>Studies reported either the absence of chest pain over a week (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>) or a month (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK>), or the number of chest-pain free days over a week (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). All showed significant improvements following intervention, apart from brief CBT where the improvement failed to reach statistical significance. For <LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>, the results were of the combined RCT and crossover trial. <LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK> also reported the number of chest-pain free days over a week at the end of the RCT stage before the crossover trial, but did not include SDs. Therefore we were only able to combine the studies of CBT that reported the absence of chest pain over a certain period of time (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>) or that included SDs when reporting the number of chest-pain free days (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>). In the case of absence of chest pain (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>), there was a significant reduction in reports of chest pain in the first three months following the intervention. The random-effects model gave a relative risk of 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92; three studies, 172 participants; I statistic = 59%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This was maintained from three to 12 months afterwards, the relative risk being 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.76; two studies; 111 participants; I statistic = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) for both fixed or random-effects models. Exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK>, which reported the absence of chest pain over a month following brief CBT, made no significant difference to the results. Exclusion of the combined RCT and crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>) also made no significant difference to the results. There was also a significant increase in the number of chest pain free days up to three months following intervention; the MD was 3.00 (95% CI 0.23 to 5.77; two studies, 81 participants; I statistic = 69%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). However, this was largely attributable to <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>, which reported the results of a group intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Chest pain frequency and severity</HEADING>
<P>Where stated, studies reported the frequency of chest pain episodes over a week (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>), two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-DeGuire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">DeGuire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>) or a month (<LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). All studies reported reduced chest pain frequency, except <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK> the baseline scores in the treatment group were much higher than in the controls. At one month follow-up, chest pain frequency had fallen by 7.9 per month in the treatment group as opposed to 4.8 in the controls, with a significant Group  Time interaction effect. <LINK REF="STD-Jonsbu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsbu 2011</LINK> reported frequency of symptoms of chest pain or palpitations on a scale rated as 1 ("daily"), 2 ("weekly or more often"), 3 ("rare but sometimes") and 4 ("no symptoms for the last 6 months"). Therefore we could not include this in the meta-analysis. There was a reduction in participants receiving either CBT or guided re-breathing compared with controls within the first three months of follow-up on the random-effects model; the MD was -2.26 (-4.41 to -0.12; seven studies, 294 participants; I statistic = 94%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). However, this was not maintained at three to nine months follow-up (MD -0.81 (95% CI -2.35, 0.74; four studies, 164 participants; I statistic = 75%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Restricting the analyses to only those studies that reported the results of CBT made little difference to any of these results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>, a study of hypnotherapy, reported rates of overall improvement in chest pain; 80% of the hypnotherapy group improved compared with only 23% of controls (P = 0.008) at 17 weeks follow-up. This improvement was maintained approximately two years later with 14 of the 15 patients (93%) who received hypnotherapy now classified as responders compared with only 3/13 (23%) controls (P = 0.001).</P>
<P>Four studies reported chest pain severity (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK> calculated a daily chest pain index (PI) score in which duration of chest pain activity was weighed by the intensity of the chest pain. At three months follow-up, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in the random-effects model (MD = -4.64 (95% CI -12.18 to 2.89; four studies, 180 participants; I statistic = 65%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). It is important to note that <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK> reported outcomes at two intervals; mid-treatment and post-treatment. The scores included in <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, are post-treatment outcomes.One study reported frequency of GP visits over 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>): 29% of support patients made one or more GP visits over the duration of the study, compared with 54% of the control group (P = 0.06).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Studies reported very different measures of quality of life, making quantitative integration of data difficult. Two trials showed significant improvements in global quality of life following intervention using a standardised and validated instrument (the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP)) compared to controls, but reported medians and ranges instead of means and SDs (<LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyni_x002d_Lenne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tyni-Lenne 2002</LINK>). Another study, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>, gave the percentage of subjects reporting an improvement in global quality of life: 73% of the hypnotherapy group improved compared with only 23% of controls (P = 0.02) at 17 weeks follow-up. This improvement was maintained approximately two years later with 11 of the 15 patients (73%) who received hypnotherapy now classified as responders compared to only 3/13 (23%) controls (P = 0.02). Five studies reported results using some or all of the scales of the SF-36 including physical functioning, work problems, social functioning, and problems with role due to emotional limitations (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonsbu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsbu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>), but <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK> did not report SDs. In addition to reporting the overall percentage of patients reporting improvement in global Quality of Life (QoL), <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK> gave MacNew scores for QoL derived from emotional, physical and social domains (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>). As with the SF-36, an increase in scores indicates improvement. However, the trial authors did not report the subscores. <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK> reported QoL using the Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index. This covers four domains (health and functioning, psychological/spiritual domain, social and economic domain, and family). Again, an increase in scores indicates improvement. We were, therefore, only able to combine data from <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK> for the following three areas: physical functioning, social functioning, and problems with role due to emotional limitations. In each case we combined these results with the global MacNew scores that incorporated emotional, physical and social domains. In the case of social functioning, we also attempted to integrate measures of social functioning and social disability by inverting the social impairment scale used by <LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>. There were significant differences between intervention and control groups in some of the domains at short or long term follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>) except in the cases of physical or social functioning up to three months after the intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) and role problems due to emotional limitations three to 12 months after the intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Using the random-effects or fixed-effect model made no difference to any of these results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Psychological measures</HEADING>
<P>Again, a wide variety of measures were used that measured global outcome or the presence of depression or anxiety. <LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>, a combined RCT and crossover trial, reported a significant reduction in psychiatric cases compared with controls as determined by a standardised psychiatric interview following intervention; the relative risk was 0.42 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.8). We quantitatively analysed seven studies of self-reported depression using standardised instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonsbu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsbu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lahmann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>), combined with a further study that reported overall morbidity including depression (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). There was no significant difference between intervention and control groups up to three months after the intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). Notably, <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK> reported outcomes at two intervals within the three month time-frame. Using one or the other made no difference in the results of <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>. We also quantitatively analysed seven studies of self-reported anxiety using standardised instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lahmann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>), combined with a further study that reported overall morbidity including anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>). A ninth study reported medians and ranges rather than means and SDs (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>). This precluded inclusion in quantitative analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK> reported P values but no actual scores. For the eight studies that we were able to combine data from, there was a significant difference between intervention and controls up to three months after the intervention; the SMD was -0.24 (95% CI -0.47 to -0.01; eight studies, 383 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). Again, <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK> reported outcomes at two intervals within the three month time-frame. Using one or the other made no difference in the results of this analysis. There was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in overall psychological symptoms measured by either the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) or HADS from three to 12 months afterwards, with the SMD being -0.14 (95% CI -0.39 to 0.11; four studies, 246 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). One study, <LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK>, only gave the results of the anxiety and depression subscales of the HADS but using either made no difference to these results. Four studies reported three subscores of a scale specific to cardiac anxiety including fear, avoidance and attention to symptoms rather than generalised anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK>).

Using the random-effects model or fixed-effect model made no difference to any of these results. <LINK REF="STD-Spinhoven-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Spinhoven 2010</LINK> reported outcomes at two intervals; mid-treatment and post-treatment. The scores included in <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK> are post-treatment outcomes. One study, <LINK REF="STD-van-Beek-2013" TYPE="STUDY">van Beek 2013</LINK>, assessed disease severity with the CGI by a blinded independent rater.

Of the seven studies examining CBT, two did not report change in health beliefs as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Esler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK> reported that prior to the intervention, all study patients believed their chest pain was due to a physical cause, while afterwards 69% attributed their pain to stress. They did not report the difference between intervention and control groups. A further study reported that Illness perceptions mediated the short and long term treatment effects of a three-session CBT programme for patients with NCCP (<LINK REF="STD-Jonsbu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsbu 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>, a study of support groups, reported that patients randomised to support showed a trend towards improved health beliefs total score (P = 0.068) and threat perception (P = 0.062) compared with the controls. Two studies reported non significant differences in health beliefs after the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK> reported that participants were significantly less likely to believe they had heart disease after the intervention (11/56, 20%) than before (25/56, 45%, P &lt; 0.05).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Many of our analyses had a high level of statistical heterogeneity. We explored possible reasons for this heterogeneity in post hoc analyses, omitting each study in turn where there were more than two studies. This did not alter heterogeneity apart from the following two comparisons: <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>: Any chest pain up to three months after intervention, and <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>: Chest pain frequency three to 12 months after intervention. In each case, exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Van-Peski_x002d_Oosterbaan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Peski-Oosterbaan 1999</LINK> reduced heterogeneity to non-significant levels. The reasons for this heterogeneity are unclear and as a consequence, we have presented the results of random effects models in all the tables to take heterogeneity into account. We did this even where there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity as we could not definitely exclude other sources of between-study variation, such as clinical heterogeneity, given the increase in studies since the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2005</LINK>). However, when there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity, we reported the results of both the fixed-effect and random-effects models in the text.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Due to the small number of included trials in each analysis, these results are limited and should be interpreted with caution. Issues concerning the proposed sensitivity analyses are as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Differences between studies that define psychiatric symptoms operationally (clinician diagnosis or validated questionnaire (and whether validated in this specific population or in other groups): all studies included in the meta-analysis used standardised instruments;</LI>
<LI>Differences between types of psychological interventions and types of controls: there was little change to the results when analyses were restricted to CBT or hypnotherapy only. All but two studies used individual therapy;</LI>
<LI>Differences between routes of referral for intervention (referred to psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, other mental health professionals, or other clinicians for management): most studies did not report route of referral. There was no difference to the results when studies were excluded by route of referral;</LI>
<LI>Differences between participants with and without a family history of heart disease: there were no studies in which this information was included;</LI>
<LI>Differences between studies that use subject reported pain or assessments by clinicians or carers: there were no studies that used assessments by clinicians or carers;</LI>
<LI>Differences between well defined and less-well defined psychological interventions: there was little change to the results when analyses were restricted to CBT or hypnotherapy only;</LI>
<LI>Differences between analyses involving all studies and excluding trials of lower methodological quality: two studies combined the results of the RCT and crossover designs (<LINK REF="STD-Klimes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klimes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Potts 1999</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-05-27 04:37:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent chest pain in the absence of coronary artery disease is a common problem that sometimes leads to excess use of medical care. Although many studies have examined the causes of pain in these patients, few clinical trials have evaluated treatment. The studies included in this updated Cochrane review provide an insight into the effectiveness of psychological interventions for this group of patients. We have attempted to draw modest conclusions based on available evidence, and to highlight areas requiring further study, rather than draw conclusions that may not be based on evidence of high quality.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review revealed limited evidence for the effective psychological treatment of NSCP. We identified only a small number of RCTs, and two combined data from RCTs and crossover trials. The identified studies were heterogeneous in terms of design, types of and implementation of interventions, outcome measurement and follow-up periods. All had small numbers of participants and questions concerning methodological quality. For example, where participants were waiting-list controls, especially in combined RCT and crossover designs, it is not possible for the subject to be unaware of which group they are in, and many studies relied on participants' self-report assessments of outcome. In addition, due to the nature of the main interventions of interest, it was impossible to blind the therapists as to whether the participant was in the intervention or control arm. Furthermore, in three studies the blinding of participants was expressly forbidden by the local ethics committee because of issues in obtaining fully informed consent (<LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asbury-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Asbury 2011</LINK>). For this reason, all studies had a high risk of performance bias. Finally, three studies were thought to have a high risk of outcome bias. Although there was a low risk of bias in other domains, the results showed heterogeneity and caution is therefore required in their interpretation. Given the clinical and statistical heterogeneity, we have stressed the random effects results.</P>
<P>Despite these problems, it was possible to aggregate some data for short and long-term outcomes and the aggregated data support a modest to moderate benefit for psychological interventions, especially those using a cognitive-behavioural framework or hypnotherapy. These results are consistent with findings for other types of medically unexplained symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kroenke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kroenke 2000</LINK>). The evidence for other interventions, such as brief nurse-led counselling, is less clear.</P>
<P>There are several practical difficulties concerning the delivery of psychological interventions for NSCP. One is that participation rates in many studies were low (40% to 60%). It has been suggested that this is because many studies of approaches such as CBT use the Attribution Model (<LINK REF="STD-Esler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2004</LINK>). This requires patients to complete a cardiological work up, such as stress testing, to definitely establish that the pain is noncardiac in origin before therapy can begin, thus marking one obstacle to treatment. Furthermore the Attribution Model may be incompatible with the patient's view of their symptoms. Even if patients can be convinced, this psychological attribution may still be controversial with their family and friends, and many physicians. If patients are accustomed to thinking of chest pain as a medical illness they may not be ready to attribute their symptoms to having a psychological cause. By contrast, the Biopsychosocial Model accepts that most illness, whether physical or psychiatric, is influenced and determined by biological, psychological and social phenomena. This model assumes that better patient outcomes are achieved when therapeutic interventions are based on evaluation of the relationship between biological, psychological and social variables. This approach may be more in tune with the patient's perception of their problems and does not require physical investigations to be completed before therapy can begin (<LINK REF="STD-Esler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Esler 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Another difficulty is access to psychotherapists, as cardiologists or gastroenterologists have neither the time nor training necessary to provide the treatment. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in presenting physical symptomatology, concerns, needs, beliefs and outcomes among patients. A 'stepped' approach to the implementation of psychological interventions has therefore been suggested (<LINK REF="STD-Mayou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mayou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1997</LINK>). Such an approach would include a fuller explanation of the possibility and meaning of a negative outcome of angiography as preparation for the procedure and more opportunity for discussion with cardiologists prior to discharge. There should also be follow-up for review of the findings, reinforcement of the plan for symptomatic treatment and encouragement for a return to fuller activities.</P>
<P>One of our objectives was to compare different psychological treatments. However, due to the small number of included studies, we can only draw conclusions about CBT and possibly hypnotherapy. We also wished to assess the association between treatment effect sizes and methodological features. We were unable to do so because of the small number of included participants and methodological characteristics.</P>
<P>Only 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The lack of research in this area and standardisation of outcomes may mean this is a relatively new field. Alternatively, researchers may be uncomfortable with randomisation and the use of controls. A further possibility is that participants with NSCP are reluctant to accept psychological explanations and interventions for their symptoms, making this a difficult group with which to conduct such studies. The high rates of attrition in many of the studies lends support for this final explanation.</P>

<P>Psychological treatments, especially CBT therapy and hypnotherapy, may be effective in the short-term for the treatment of patients with NSCP. However, the evidence is limited to small trials of questionable quality.</P>
<P>Evidence suggests that if untreated, patients with NSCP have levels of health service use comparable to patients with chest pain of organic causes (<LINK REF="REF-Kisely-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 1997</LINK>). It may be useful to detect NCCP early, identify individual treatment needs and intervene before it becomes chronic. Patients in emergency departments or with recent onset of chest pain should be prepared for the possibility and meaning of negative findings. Those patients with chronic NSCP may benefit from specialist psychological intervention.</P>

<P>In the protocol we stated that we would only include RCTs where &lt; 20% of participants originally randomised were lost to follow-up. In view of the limited number of included trials, we relaxed these criteria to include studies that combined RCT and cross-over designs, and trials that had greater losses to follow-up. In each case, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of inclusion of these studies. Given the increase in the number of studies since publication of <LINK REF="REF-Kisely-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisely 2005</LINK>, we have presented the results of random effects models in all the tables even where there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. This is because we could not definitely exclude other sources of between-study variation, such as clinical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Eligible participants were cardiology outpatients of two academic and two nonacademic hospitals who had been discharged with a diagnosis of NCCP. Inclusion criteria were NCCP as main presenting complaint; NCCP occurring at least once a week, or at least once per month if accompanied by severe psychological distress; age between 18 and 75 years. An initial charts review identified 3270 patients diagnosed with NCCP. Between January 1997 and January 2002. Of these, 2367 patients (72.4%) returned a questionnaire about current symptoms, of whom 583 (24.6%) had no interest in the study, and 1310 (55.3%) did not fulfil the inclusion criteria regarding chest pain frequency. The remaining 474 potential participants received detailed information about the study and were invited for a screening and information session. After the screening session, 95 patients (20.0%) agreed to be randomised. After the intake, 26 patients had to be excluded, leaving 69 patients (37 males) who started the trial.</P>
