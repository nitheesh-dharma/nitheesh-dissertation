<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-30 11:15:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of independent living programmes (ILPs), a widespread and varied group of programmes intended to improve outcomes for foster care (looked-after) youth leaving the care system. There is evidence that of the many thousands of young people who are discharged from care each year, a sizeable number lack the life skills or resources necessary to succeed independently. Compared to the general population, these young adults face much higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, dependency on public assistance, physical and mental health problems, and involvement with the criminal justice system. ILPs, which incorporate independent living skills training, personal development, and educational and vocational support, are one strategy to improve these outcomes.</P>
<P>So as to incorporate only the highest-quality evidence, this review was limited to randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of ILPs for young people leaving the care system. Outcomes of interest included educational attainment, employment, health, housing, and other relevant life skills outcomes.</P>
<P>After an exhaustive search, no study was found that met our criteria. The primary reason for excluding studies was the lack of a randomised or quasi-randomised design. Eighteen studies utilising nonrandom comparisons, one-group longitudinal designs, or qualitative methodology were identified and are detailed in the table of excluded studies. The results of these studies generally favoured ILP participants for the outcomes of interest; however, their weak methodology makes it difficult to draw any firm or reliable inferences for policy and practice. On the whole, adverse effects were rarely observed.</P>
<P>This review is severely limited by the methodological quality of the evidence base for ILPs. Further research incorporating randomised designs is both feasible and necessary.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Independent living programmes (ILPs) are designed to provide young people leaving care with skills that will limit their disadvantage and aid in their successful transition into adulthood. Programmes focus on personal development, independent living skills, education, and vocational support. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of independent living programmes for young people leaving the care system.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2005); EMBASE (1980 to June 2005); CINAHL (1982 to June 2005); PsycINFO (1887 to June 2005); Sociological Abstracts (1952 - June 2005); Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) (1987- June 2005) and Dissertation Abstracts (to June 2005). All bibliographies were cross-referenced, and experts were contacted for unpublished or ongoing studies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ILPs to standard care, another intervention, no intervention, or a wait-list control, for young people leaving care systems at their country's statutory age of discharge. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>2196 citations were identified and screened independently by two reviewers. Full text versions were obtained for 54 papers. None met the review's inclusion criteria. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No study was found that met the inclusion criteria of the review. Eighteen studies using nonrandomised or noncomparative designs were found, which generally reported favourable outcomes for ILP participants; however, reliable inferences cannot be drawn from these studies due to their use of weak methodology. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Results from randomised controlled trials show no evidence of the effectiveness of ILPs in improving or impairing outcomes for young people discharged from care. Further research into ILPs using randomised controlled designs is needed. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">The Child Welfare System</HEADING>
<P>It is widely agreed that good parenting consists of providing a safe, secure and stable environment in which children can develop to their full potential (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>). However, not all parents are able to offer such secure and stable environments for their children, and the state may intervene for these children through the legal system. Sometimes this entails removing children from their parents' care and placing them in public care, with the state assuming overall responsibility for their upkeep. As "corporate parent," the state aims to provide for these children's education, health, social interaction, safety, and other needs that are traditionally fulfilled by the family. While in public care, children are usually placed in foster care or residential care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalence and Experiences of Children in Public Care</HEADING>
<P>Each year a large number of children enter public care systems around the world. There were 523,000 children in public care in the United States in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-CTD-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTD 2005</LINK>), 61,100 children in public care in England in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-DfES-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DfES 2004</LINK>), over 4,500 children in public care in Wales in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-NAW-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAW 2005</LINK>), over 12,000 children in public care in Scotland in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-SENS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SENS 2005</LINK>), and 21,735 children in out-of-home care in Australia in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2005</LINK>). In the United States, public (foster) care placement types include homes of nonfamily members, homes of family members, group homes or institutions, pre-adoptive homes, and "other" placements: in 2003, the distribution of youth among these placements was 46%, 23%, 19%, 5%, and 7% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-NCCANI-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCANI 2005</LINK>). In England, public care placement types include foster family assignments, children homes, placement with parents, adoption, and "other": in 2005, the distribution of youth among these placements was 68%, 11%, 9%, 5%, and 5% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-DfES-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DfES 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children in public care systems come from diverse backgrounds with different cultures, ethnicities, needs, abilities and pre-care histories (<LINK REF="STD-Biehal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Biehal 1995</LINK>). Most enter public care because they have suffered or are likely to have suffered maltreatment (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1991</LINK>); they are also more likely to come from multiply disadvantaged backgrounds (<LINK REF="REF-Bebbington-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bebbington 1989</LINK>). Once children are in public care, their deleterious experiences do not necessarily end; many have to deal with the long-term effects of the abuse and neglect they experienced before entering care (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2003</LINK>), and some may have further negative experiences whilst in public care. Children in public care are more likely to be diagnosed with emotional or behavioural problems (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2003</LINK>), to experience unstable care placements (<LINK REF="REF-Biehal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biehal 1992</LINK>), and to face accompanying difficulties at school (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-OFSTED-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">OFSTED 1995</LINK>) than children living in private households. A 2003 survey by England's Office for National Statistics reported that 45 percent of children aged 5-17 years in public care had been diagnosed with a mental disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2003</LINK>). Several studies have also catalogued the poor educational attainment of young people living in and leaving the care system (<LINK REF="REF-Barth-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barth 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Courtney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtney 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Festinger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festinger 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Garnett-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1994</LINK>). The difficulties that these children experience at school not only lessen their educational attainments but, more importantly, also deprive them of potentially protective factors necessary to counter the adverse effects of unpleasant experiences during childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Young People Leaving Care</HEADING>
<P>Every year about 20,000 American and 6,000-8,000 English young people leave their respective public care systems (<LINK REF="REF-CLA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CLA 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-DfES-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DfES 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-DfES-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DfES 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-USGAO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">USGAO 1999</LINK>). A significant number of young people leaving public care are disadvantaged and ill-prepared for adult life (<LINK REF="REF-Barth-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barth 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Courtney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtney 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Festinger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festinger 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Garnett-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnett 1992</LINK>). The families of young people leaving care are often unable to offer the sustained and substantial support that would benefit the youths' transition from adolescence to adulthood. As a result, many young people leave care with little social, emotional or financial support from their families as compared to their peers in the general population; they also typically make the transition to independence earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Cashmore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cashmore 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Courtney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtney 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 1996</LINK>). Notably, approximately 50% of the youth leaving care annually in England are aged 16-17 years, while youth in the general population are estimated to leave home at age 22 (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1999</LINK>). However, the age of young people leaving care varies worldwide.</P>
<P>Studies indicate that a significant proportion of young people leaving care do not possess the life skills or resources necessary to succeed independently. Upon leaving care they are more likely than youth in the general population to be homeless, unemployed, and/or dependent on public assistance; they are also more likely to experience physical and mental health problems, engage in risky health behaviours, and become involved with the criminal justice system (<LINK REF="REF-Barth-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barth 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Courtney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtney 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Festinger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festinger 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maunders-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maunders 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recognition of the difficulties facing young people leaving care, policies have been enacted to help prepare them for adulthood. These include the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program of 1999 in the US (<LINK REF="REF-NRCYD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRCYD 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barth 2004</LINK>) and the Children (Leaving Care) Act of 2000 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Independent Living Programmes</HEADING>
<P>Independent living programmes (ILPs) are designed to provide young people leaving care with skills that will limit their disadvantage and aid in their successful transition into adulthood. ILPs recognize that leaving care is a process, not an event, and that it requires social support and life skills preparation. These programmes are not intended to replace the supportive role played by a family, but instead aim to provide care leavers with skills that will help them succeed despite the absence of family support. In the main, ILPs utilise social skills training techniques, which incorporate instruction, modelling, roleplays and feedback. These training techniques have been used effectively to teach skills acquisition and improve youth performance in both clinical and non-clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Spence-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>ILPs focus on both personal development skills and independent living skills. Personal development skills may include communication, decision making, conflict resolution, and anger management. Independent living skills include career exploration, job and interview skills, money management, household management, accessing housing, seeking legal assistance, and utilising community resources (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-USGAO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">USGAO 1999</LINK>). ILPs can also provide educational and vocational support. Some authors have advocated that ILPs include interpersonal and relationship training as well (<LINK REF="REF-Courtney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtney 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Propp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Propp 2003</LINK>), although these skills are not consistently incorporated into existing programmes.</P>
<P>ILPs are frequently conducted in group formats with individual support (i.e., mentoring) provided on a one-to-one basis (<LINK REF="STD-Biehal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Biehal 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meston-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meston 1988</LINK>). Many ILPs provide supervised living conditions under which young people can practise the skills they have learnt (<LINK REF="REF-Mauzerall-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mauzerall 1983</LINK>), and they occur in diverse settings such as community centres, group homes, transition placements, and supervised practice placements (<LINK REF="STD-Biehal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Biehal 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meston-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meston 1988</LINK>). ILPs may also be delivered to young people living in independent tenancies. The content, setting, and delivery of ILPs may vary depending on a country's culture, legislation, or policy context, as well as the age at which youth leave care.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the wide use of independent living programmes, their effectiveness is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-USGAO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">USGAO 1999</LINK>) and the extent to which the acquisition of independent living skills by young people leaving care is associated with easier transition to independent and self sufficient living remains uncertain. Some evidence suggests that such programmes may be successful in improving outcomes such as education, employment, housing, health and life skills for young people leaving care (<LINK REF="REF-Loman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loman 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mallon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mallon 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Scannapieco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Scannapieco 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Biehal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Biehal 1995</LINK>), but this evidence is based on narrative reviews, non-systematic searches, and non-experimental studies.</P>
<P>This review aims systematically to determine the effectiveness of these independent living programmes in increasing the life chances of young people leaving care. Knowing the effectiveness of such programmes is important given the numerous challenges associated with living in and leaving public care.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies (i.e., where allocation is by date of birth, alternate numbers, case number, day of the week, or month of the year) were eligible for inclusion. Since this review aimed to synthesise the evidence from study designs least prone to bias, quasi-experimental studies were not included. However, all studies evaluating ILPs which were identified by the search were described in the Table of Excluded Studies, regardless of study design. </P>
<P>No study was found that met the review's inclusion criteria, so meta-analysis was not possible in this version of the review. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, study design will be included in the data extraction and explored as a possible source of heterogeneity. </P>
<P>Included studies had to compare an independent living programme to a control group. The control group could be a 'standard/usual care', another intervention (e.g. mentoring alone), no intervention, or a waiting list.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Young people leaving the care system at their respective country's statutory ages of discharge from the care system.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Independent living programmes (as described above), containing the provision of training and/or support in the acquisition of personal development. </P>
<P>Programmes specifically targeted at young people with special needs such as those with physical or learning disabilities, teenage parents, young offenders, and those in psychiatric institutions were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-06-30 11:17:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were only included if they were explicitly targeted at improving at least one of the following:</P>
<P>Educational attainment (example, high school diploma, national vocational diploma, higher education)<BR/>Employment (example, full time employment, unemployment rates, income levels)<BR/>Health status (example, teenage pregnancy/fatherhood rates, drug use, mental health)<BR/>Housing (example, homeless, own accommodation, or living with family)<BR/>Life skills including behaviour outcomes (examples: coping skills; financial skills and knowledge; knowledge of state benefits systems; accessing community resources; dependence on public assistance; involvement with the criminal justice system)</P>
<P>No study was found that met the review's inclusion criteria, so meta-analysis was not possible in this version of the review. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, these outcomes will be treated as entirely separate constructs in all analyses. For example, if a study reports on educational attainment and health status, these two outcomes will be entered into separate analyses. If a study reports two separate measures for the same outcome (e.g., percentage experiencing homelessness and percentage living in their own accommodation), each of the outcomes will be analysed separately (e.g., all studies reporting on homelessness will be grouped for one analysis, and all studies reporting on the percentage of participants living in their own accommodation will be grouped in a separate analysis).</P>
<P>Some possible outcomes of ILPs such as housing and employment can be assessed immediately after intervention. Other outcomes such as higher education attainment, health status, holding on to employment and housing, and behaviour outcomes need to be assessed over longer time periods. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, outcomes will therefore be assessed as short term (immediately after intervention) and long-term (12 months after intervention) to determine whether immediate outcomes can be sustained.</P>
<P>The data sources used to assess outcomes included agency records and self reports using psychometrically sound and validated scales of assessment. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, we will investigate the method of outcome assessment as a source of heterogeneity and possible bias. Political influences such as government targets and the high mobility of care leavers may affect the reliability of agency records as a source of outcome measurement.</P>

The extracted data will be shown in a Table of Included Studies. Information about how effect sizes are extracted from the primary studies will be coded.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>No study was found that met the review's inclusion criteria, so quality assessment was not conducted for this version of the review. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, two authors working independently will critically assess the methodological quality of studies against a set of criteria that considers their degree of allocation concealment, follow up, intention-to-treat, and blinding of assessors. Quality categories will be assigned to each criterion. For example, allocation of concealment will be assessed, as illustrated in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2005</LINK>) as follows:</P>
<P>(A)Indicates adequate allocation concealment; e.g. by telephone randomisation or sealed envelopes.<BR/>(B)Indicates uncertainty about the adequacy of allocation concealment; e.g. where method of concealment is not reported<BR/>(C)Indicates allocation was inadequately concealed; e.g. open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternation, day of the week, case number.</P>
<P>Since studies using quasi-randomisation methods (e.g., assignment by coin flip, case record number, date of birth) will be included, evidence of baseline differences and attempts made to control for them will be examined. Evidence of baseline differences will not necessarily lead to exclusion. If a quasi-randomised study does not control for baseline differences, authors will be contacted for additional data regarding the allocation sequence and the possible effects of baseline differences. The review group's editorial base will be contacted where reviewers are uncertain whether to include such studies.</P>
<P>Given the nature of the intervention, it is unlikely that providers and participants in the intervention can be blinded; hence this will not be used as a quality criterion. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, information about blinding will be coded and investigated as a possible source of heterogeneity and bias.</P>
<P>Additional information regarding methodological quality will be sought from primary study authors as necessary. Uncertainty and disagreements will be discussed among the review authors. If no consensus can be reached, disagreements regarding methodological quality will be brought to the review's editorial base.</P>

<P>No study was found that met the review's inclusion criteria, so meta-analysis was not possible in this version of the review. Should relevant studies be identified in the future, any meta-analysis will be conducted according to the following methods. For dichotomous outcome data, log odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Continuous data will be analysed if means and standard deviations are available and the data are not skewed. For continuous data that must have values greater than 0 (e.g., number of arrests), we will define skewed data as that for which the mean is less than the sum of two standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2005</LINK>). Where they are reported in the primary studies, we will also inspect histograms, scatterplots, and summary statistics for evidence of skew. If any test or inspection suggests that data are likely to be skewed, authors will be contacted for more information, log transformed data, or the raw data. Where the same outcomes are measured in different ways, standardised mean differences will be calculated and compared across studies. Where outcomes are measured in the same way, weighted mean differences will be calculated.</P>

The I2 statistic will determine the percentage of variability that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error, where a value greater than 50% suggests moderate heterogeneity.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>No study was found that met the inclusion criteria of the review. The search yielded eighteen studies that used nonrandomised, one-group longitudinal, and qualitative designs to evaluate ILPs. These studies are cited in the table of excluded studies; where the primary references were unavailable after extensive searching and repeated attempts to contact the authors, study data were extracted from secondary sources. Besides a lack of randomisation, these studies faced a number of methodological limitations, such as the use of small sample sizes, the presence of baseline differences, substantial variation in ILP design, inadequate information regarding effect sizes and confidence intervals, and inadequate reporting on implementation fidelity. Collectively, these studies appeared to show that some ILPs may improve educational, employment-related, and housing-related outcomes for young people leaving the care system. The strength of this evidence, however, is insufficient to draw conclusions for policy or practice.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Considering that the review intended to assess the effectiveness of ILPs, studies that used a randomised controlled design would have provided the most reliable evidence. Yet, no randomised or quasi-randomised controlled study was found, meaning that no study could be included in this review. </P>
<P>In the absence of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled studies, studies utilising other designs were found. Where control groups were used, these evaluations generally reported better outcomes for participants who took part in an ILP prior to discharge than for controls. This trend was consistent across most of the outcomes of interest to this review, including educational attainment, housing, and employment. However, reliable inferences cannot be drawn from nonrandomised studies due to their use of weak methodology. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Results from this review show no firm evidence from randomised controlled studies regarding the effectiveness of ILPs in improving outcomes for young people discharged from care. Given the methodological weakness of available studies, it is difficult to make definite conclusions for practice at this time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is the need for further research into ILPs using randomised controlled designs. Studies that randomise participants among intervention conditions can investigate questions of effectiveness and harm most thoroughly. It is important to acknowledge that randomisation may be difficult in settings where policies mandate ILP services for care leavers, such as the UK context after the Children (Leaving Care) Act of 2000; however, in settings where randomisation is possible, RCTs will provide the clearest evidence of effectiveness. Future research should also take into account the weaknesses identified in the available evidence and incorporate larger sample sizes, report more details regarding implementation fidelity, and measure outcomes over longer follow up periods. Additional studies or moderator analyses should address the effectiveness of ILPs among care leavers with different care placements, such as family placements or group homes. The theoretical assumptions of ILPs also require investigation, since it is unclear whether (and how) independent living skills can compensate for a relative lack of family support. The results of new studies can then be compared to the current evidence to establish a more accurate appraisal of effectiveness. Without more rigorous research, the evidence base cannot provide reliable answers to practitioners and policymakers regarding the role of independent living programmes for youth leaving care.</P>

Comparisons also made between youth who reported having received independent living services in 5 core subject areas (n=45) and youth who had not (n=765).<BR/>Reported findings: No significant effects were found for "any skills training" as opposed to "no skills training" for maintaining a job for over 1 year, living without cost to the community, completing high school, accessing health care, avoiding early parenting, or general satisfaction. When "skills training" was defined as receiving training in all of 5 skill areas (budgeting, obtaining credit, consumer skills, education, and employment), this training was significantly correlated with a higher likelihood of maintaining a job for more than 1 year, living without cost to the community, accessing health care, and general satisfaction.<BR/>

Nonsignificantly favoured ILP participants for having completed high school or GED (37% vs 18%). Favoured ILP participants for being employed part or full time (59% vs 44%). No significant differences in wages. ILP participants utilised housing, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Women Infants and Children (WIC), and emergency assistance at a higher rate than nonparticipants. Favoured ILP participants over nonparticipants for ever having had difficulty paying bills (5% vs 25%).<BR/>

<P>Not a randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trial.<BR/>Study design: One-group assessment of case records and individual interviews after discharge from care. Logistic regression analyses to determine role of independent living training in high school completion and "success" in adulthood. Interviews took place an average of 10 years after participants left care. Response rate was 68% (3.4% of original sample were in prison, 0.7% were in psychiatric institutions, 3.9% were deceased, 24% did not respond). <BR/>Location: Participants had received care through Casey programmes in AZ, CA, HI, ID, LA, MT, ND, OK, OR, SD, TX, WA, WY. <BR/>n=1,609 Casey program alumni served by any of the 23 Casey Field offices in operation in 1998. Participants fulfilled 3 conditions: (1) had been served by Casey Family Programs offices 1966-1988, (2) had been placed with a Casey foster family for 12m or more, and (3) had been discharged from foster care at least 12m previously.<BR/>Reported findings: 55 variables were put into stepwise multiple regression to discover predictors of success as an adult. "Success" was based on years of education, household income, physical health, mental health, and relationship satisfaction. "Life Skills / Independent Living Preparation" was one of 9 variables that predicted success. "Life Skills / Independent Living Preparation" was measured by asking participants for "retrospective ratings of life skills readiness" overall and on 16 specific skills (e.g. food purchasing, money management). This does not specifically denote participation in an ILP - it indicates how well-prepared participants remembered feeling when they left care. </P>
<P>Additional logistic regression analyses identified which variables predicted high school completion. According to the resulting prediction model, participants receiving independent living training ONCE as opposed to NEVER were 1.9 times more likely to complete high school. Participants who received independent living training INTERMITTENTLY as opposed to NEVER were 1.8 times more likely to complete high school. Participants who received EXTENSIVE independent living training as opposed to NEVER receiving training were 2.8 times more likely to complete high school. Fewer than 35% of the entire sample had received any independent living training. In the interview, this was described as "independent living training groups or workshops." Again, it is unclear whether this denotes participation in an ILP as defined in this review.</P>
