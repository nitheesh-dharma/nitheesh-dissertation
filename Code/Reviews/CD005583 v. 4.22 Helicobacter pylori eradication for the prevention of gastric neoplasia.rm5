<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Whether testing healthy people for <I>Helicobacter</I>
<I> pylori</I>
 and treating those infected routinely with a course of antibiotics decreases the number of new cases of gastric cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with <I>H. pylori</I> infection are more likely to develop gastric cancer than people who are not infected with the bacterium. For this reason, <I>H. pylori </I>is classed as carcinogenic (causing cancer) to humans. Many people worldwide die of gastric cancer every year, because by the time those affected seek the opinion of a doctor, the condition is often advanced. However, <I>H. pylori </I>infection is easily treatable with a one-week course of antibiotics.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>A literature search up to December 2013 found 6 trials (containing 6497 participants, 3 trials at low risk of bias). Five of the studies were based in Asia.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that antibiotics for <I>H. pylori</I> have a small benefit in preventing gastric cancer (51 (1.6%) of 3294 participants given treatment developed gastric cancer subsequently, compared with 76 (2.4%) of 3203 given no treatment or a placebo), but it is unclear whether or not they decrease the number of deaths from the disease, increase or decrease the number of deaths due to any cause, or increase or decrease the number of cases of oesophageal cancer. Data about side effects of treatment were poorly reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Three trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. One study was at high risk of bias because no placebo was used for the active eradication therapy regimen, and so this part of the trial was unblinded, and the other study was at high risk of bias due to inconsistencies in data reporting at the two points of follow-up. We were unable to resolve this discrepancy despite contacting the original authors. As a result, we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias.</P>

<P>We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to December 2013). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in <I>Gut</I>) and Digestive Disease Week (published in <I>Gastroenterology</I>) between 2001 and 2013. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of <I>H. pylori</I> therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic <I>H. pylori</I>-positive adults. Trials had to follow up participants for at least two years and needed to have at least two participants with gastric cancer as an outcome. We defined gastric cancer as any gastric adenocarcinoma, including intestinal (differentiated) or diffuse (undifferentiated) type, with or without specified histology.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We collected data on incidence of gastric cancer, incidence of oesophageal cancer, deaths from gastric cancer, deaths from any cause, and adverse effects arising due to therapy.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:30:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials met all our eligibility criteria and provided extractable data. Three trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Five trials were conducted in Asian populations. In preventing development of subsequent gastric cancer, <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy was superior to placebo or no treatment (6 trials, 6497 participants, risk ratio (RR) of developing subsequent gastric cancer 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.95; moderate-quality evidence). Only one trial reported effect of eradication of <I>H. pylori </I>on development of subsequent oesophageal cancer (2 (0.2%) among 817 participants assigned to eradication therapy, compared with 1 (0.1%) of 813 participants allocated to placebo; RR 1.99; 95% CI 0.18 to 21.91). The effect of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication on preventing death from gastric cancer compared with placebo or no treatment was uncertain due to wide confidence intervals (3 trials, 4475 participants, RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of an effect on all-cause mortality (4 trials, 5253 participants, RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.38; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events data were poorly reported.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of death from malignant disease worldwide, resulting in 750,000 deaths each year (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2010</LINK>). In most high-income countries, the incidence of gastric cancer is falling, (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2006</LINK>), but the increase in age of the world population means that the total number of deaths from gastric cancer is set to rise for the foreseeable future (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 1998</LINK>). The treatment of gastric cancer is unsatisfactory. Almost half of gastric cancers are inoperable at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lello-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lello 2007</LINK>), and the five-year survival of these individuals is close to zero. Those undergoing operative treatment often require extensive surgery, with a 5-year survival rate of only 20% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2005</LINK>). Survival may be improved if the disease is diagnosed at an earlier stage (<LINK REF="REF-Degiuli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degiuli 2006</LINK>), but the cost of population screening for gastric cancer with upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy would be prohibitive. Even if only those with upper GI symptoms that may be indicative of an occult gastric cancer, such as dyspepsia, were screened by endoscopy, the cost of detecting one malignant lesion has been estimated to be as high as USD 83,000. (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2009</LINK>) One possible way to make a significant impact on mortality from gastric cancer could therefore be via primary prevention of the disease.</P>
<P>The discovery of <I>Helicobacter pylori</I> and the observation that it was responsible for the development of chronic gastritis, with subsequent gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, raised the possibility that this organism was a necessary contributor to the carcinogenic process in most cases of gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Correa-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correa-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1983</LINK>). Early nested case-control studies confirmed that individuals infected with <I>H. pylori</I> were between three and six times more likely to develop gastric cancer, compared with uninfected controls (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nomura-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nomura 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsonnet-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsonnet 1991</LINK>). This observation led the World Health Organization and the International Agency Research on Cancer to conclude that <I>H. pylori</I> was a class I carcinogen (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review and meta-analysis that identified 12 nested prospective case-control studies suggested that <I>H. pylori</I> was associated with an almost three-fold increase in odds of developing non-cardia gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-HCCG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HCCG 2001</LINK>). A policy of screening populations at high risk of gastric cancer for <I>H. pylori</I> with a non-invasive test, such as the carbon-urea breath test, and treating those who are infected could lead, theoretically, to a reduction in the incidence of gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Parsonnet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsonnet 1996</LINK>). However, healthcare providers have not seriously considered this policy, and are unlikely to do so until randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown such a screening programme to be effective. There are also concerns from nested case-control studies that the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is increased in people who are not infected with <I>H. pylori</I>, although these data are less consistent (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ye-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 2004</LINK>). These concerns stem from the theory that <I>H. pylori </I>eradication may induce gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms in some individuals, and therefore an increased risk of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.</P>
<P>The only fully published systematic review of RCTs reported a significant reduction in the relative risk of developing gastric cancer with <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy, compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Fuccio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuccio 2009</LINK>). However, the authors included data from the same trial twice, at two different follow-up points (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2009</LINK>). When only data from one or other of these follow-up points were included, the effect was no longer statistically significant. Given that it has been five years since the publication of this meta-analysis, it is possible that there may now be more published trials, as well as longer duration of follow-up in the existing trials, and this led us to re-examine this issue.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy consists of antibiotics, either alone or in combination with acid suppressant therapy, bismuth, or both. Proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy remains the 'gold standard' for the treatment of infection with <I>H. pylori</I>. With the development of accurate methods of diagnosing <I>H. pylori</I> infection, it has become relatively straightforward to confirm successful treatment, or eradication, of the infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are biologically plausible mechanisms that may explain the association between <I>H. pylori</I> and gastric cancer. The infection leads to a hyperproliferative state, intragastric concentration of ascorbic acid is reduced, and the levels of mucosal reactive oxygen metabolites capable of inducing DNA damage are increased. The eradication of <I>H. pylori</I> normalises gastric cell turnover, luminal ascorbic acid concentrations, and the level of reactive oxygen species in the mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Moayyedi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moayyedi 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Population screening for and treatment of <I>H. pylori</I> infection may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of infection with the bacterium who also have a high risk of gastric cancer.

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lead review author screened titles and abstracts of studies that had been identified by the search strategy for articles possibly eligible for the review. The lead review author then screened the selected trials to confirm eligibility, using predesigned eligibility forms. A second review author, masked to the initial assessment, also evaluated all identified trials for eligibility. A third review author adjudicated any discrepancies, and a consensus view was taken.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lead review author extracted data and recorded it on to specially developed forms. The second review author did a blinded check on this, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data entry into <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> was also double-checked. Due to the outcome of interest under study, several groups of trial investigators followed-up trial participants at more than one time point. Where we found multiple articles for a single study, we extracted only data from the latest publication from each eligible study.</P>
<P>We recorded the following characteristics for each trial:</P>
<UL>
<LI>geographical location</LI>
<LI>country of origin</LI>
<LI>number of centres</LI>
<LI>method used to confirm <I>H. pylori </I>infection</LI>
<LI>type of eradication regimen used (including dose and schedule of individual drugs within it)</LI>
<LI>duration of treatment</LI>
<LI>eradication rate</LI>
<LI>length of follow-up</LI>
<LI>dropouts reported and their reasons</LI>
<LI>subsequent occurrence of gastric cancer</LI>

<LI>mortality from gastric cancer</LI>
<LI>mortality from other causes</LI>
<LI>total number of adverse events reported</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, as some of the trials we identified performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and obtained gastric biopsy specimens in all recruited individuals, we were able to obtain the number of participants in these RCTs with preneoplastic lesions at baseline (defined as presence of gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, or dysplasia).</P>
<P>We extracted data using a modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. In this, we excluded from the analysis individuals found to be ineligible after randomisation, and those who did not receive the intervention to which they were assigned. Due to the relatively rare nature of the primary outcome of interest, we assumed that all participants lost to follow-up had not developed gastric cancer, but kept them in the denominator for the study. We did this because the shortest duration of follow-up in the studies we identified was greater than or equal to four years, and therefore drop-out rates were relatively high. We also performed a complete case analysis, as a sensitivity analysis, where we excluded all participants for whom data were missing or unavailable from the analysis altogether (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2013</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One review author assessed and a second review author checked study quality. We assessed the components of quality using the criteria described below. We assessed eight risk domains. We considered a study to have a low risk of bias if all risk domains were assessed as a low risk of bias; a high risk of bias if at least one domain was assessed as high risk; or an unclear risk of bias if at least one domain was assessed as unclear risk without any high risk domains.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation (selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We classified a study as an RCT if it was described as randomised (this includes the use of words such as randomly, random, and randomisation, etc.). We judged the study as low risk, high risk, and unclear risk according to the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if the allocation sequence was generated by computer-generated random numbers, published random number table, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, or throwing dice.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if the trial was described as randomised but the method used for generation of the allocation sequence was not described.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if selection was based on patient numbers, birth dates, visit dates, or alternative allocation.</LI>
<LI>We excluded studies that described selection based on patient or clinical preference, or any selection mechanism that cannot be described as random. We also excluded studies that did not state whether the treatment was randomly allocated.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment (selection bias)</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if investigators were unaware of the allocation of each participant before they were entered in the trial. Acceptable methods included: central telephone randomisation schemes, pharmacy-based schemes, sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, or sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if the authors did not report or provide a description of an allocation concealment approach that allowed for classification as concealed or not concealed.</LI>
<LI>High risk, when investigators may have been aware of the allocation of each participant before they entered the trial, e.g. when allocation was based on patient data such as date of birth, hospital case note number, or visit dates, sealed envelopes that were not opaque, or a random number table that was not concealed from an investigator.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if both participants and physicians were blinded to the treatment allocation, and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if no blinding information was available or there was insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if the authors defined the study as an open study, or no party was blinded. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others was likely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if outcome assessors were blinded to the assigned treatment arm.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if no information was provided for blinding of outcome assessment.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if outcome assessors were not blinded to the assigned treatment arm. Lack of blinding is likely to influence adverse events as an outcome. However, knowledge of the assigned intervention is unlikely to impact on <I>H. pylori</I> eradication assessment.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed attrition bias for <I>H. pylori </I>eradication and adverse events.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to true outcome; missing outcome data were balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; missing data were imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit judgement of low risk or high risk (e.g. no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>
<LI>High risk, if reasons for missing outcome data were likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk were enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; per protocol analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting (reporting bias)</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if the published reports included all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if insufficient information to permit judgement of low risk or high risk.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified primary outcomes were reported; the primary outcome (gastric cancer) was reported using measurements, analysis methods, or subsets of the data that were not prespecified; the primary outcome was not prespecified or was reported incompletely; or the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if there may be a risk of bias but there is either: insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists (e.g. limited information from a conference proceeding); or insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem introduces bias.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if there is at least one important risk of bias; a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; stopped early due to a data-dependent process (including a formal stopping rule); extreme baseline imbalance; has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or any other problem.</LI>

<P>In total, we identified 1560 citations using the search strategy outlined above (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We reviewed the titles and abstracts and thought 56 articles to be potentially eligible for inclusion. Of these, 15 were not RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Hamajima-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hamajima 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juibari-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Juibari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamangar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kamangar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mabe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mabe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogura-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ogura 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohkusa-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkusa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Take-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Take 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Take-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Take 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takenaka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Takenaka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uemura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Uemura 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uemura-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Uemura 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanaoka-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yanaoka 2009</LINK>); 3 were RCTs comparing the interventions of interest, but their primary objective was to study the effect of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy on dyspepsia in the community, and they did not report any gastric cancer data (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moayyedi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Moayyedi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wildner_x002d_Christensen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wildner-Christensen 2003</LINK>); and 2 were RCTs, but with no incident gastric cancers occurring during follow-up, and therefore did not meet our eligibility criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Fischbach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fischbach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miehlke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miehlke 2001</LINK>). In the latter five studies, we contacted the lead or senior authors to ask for the most up-to-date information from the most recent follow-up point of the study, in order to ensure that we were not excluding these articles injudiciously. In all cases, the authors responded and stated that there had been no incident gastric cancers reported at the last point of follow-up. Another four articles were duplicate publications of studies already classified as ineligible.

<P>This left 29 separate papers, reporting on 6 separate RCTs that compared <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy with placebo or no treatment and providing data on subsequent incidence of gastric cancer, which therefore appeared to be eligible for inclusion. However, 19 of these articles were preliminary or duplicate publications, or protocols of eligible RCTs, and provided no new information or did not report outcomes of interest, and were therefore excluded from the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Feng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feng 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mera-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mera 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruiz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saito-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saito 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sung 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sung-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-You-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2005c</LINK>), leaving 10 papers that reported unique and extractable data (<LINK REF="STD-Correa-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Correa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gail-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saito-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Saito 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-2006" TYPE="STUDY">You 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2008</LINK>).

<P>All six trials reported a dichotomous outcome for subsequent incidence of gastric cancer. In our primary, modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we included all arms in the two trials of factorial design that also randomised participants to receive antioxidants or vitamins, as well as the 10-year follow-up data from <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2008</LINK>. Overall, 51 (1.6%) of 3294 participants assigned to eradication therapy subsequently developed gastric cancer, compared with 76 (2.4%) of 3203 participants allocated to placebo or no treatment. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between individual trial results (heterogeneity test, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, P = 0.60). Therefore there was a small, but statistically significant, benefit of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy in preventing gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected individuals (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.95) (NNTB = 124; 95% CI 78 to 843) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed several sensitivity analyses when pooling data from these six trials. In our complete case analysis, where all participants for whom data were missing or unavailable were excluded from the analysis altogether, the RR of developing subsequent gastric cancer was 0.66 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.94) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). When we performed a modified ITT analysis, substituting the 10-year follow-up data from Zhou et al. with the 5-year follow-up data from Leung et al., the RR of developing gastric cancer was 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). When we performed a complete case analysis, but substituted the 10-year follow-up data from <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2008</LINK>
 with the 5-year follow-up data from <LINK REF="REF-Leung-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2004a</LINK>, the RR was 0.69 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). When we performed a modified ITT analysis, but also included the celecoxib arms from the trial by Wong et al., the RR was 0.69 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.97) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). When we included all randomised participants from <LINK REF="STD-Correa-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Correa 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-You-2006" TYPE="STUDY">You 2006</LINK> in the analysis, that is we also included participants who were found to be ineligible after randomisation or those who did not take any medication (the most strict ITT definition), the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.95) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). Finally, we performed two data imputation analyses. If we assumed the incidence of gastric cancer for missing participants in both arms was the same as that observed in the trial control arm, the RR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.94). If we assumed the incidence of gastric cancer for missing participants in the treatment arm was the same as that observed in the trial control arm, but there were no new gastric cancer cases in the control arm among those with missing data, the RR was 0.69 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). We can therefore be reasonably confident that our conclusions are robust, regardless of the assumptions made about missing data.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that searching for and eradicating <I>H. pylori </I>infection in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic infected individuals reduces the subsequent incidence of gastric cancer. The risk of a subsequent gastric cancer with eradication therapy was reduced by 34%, and the number needed to treat to prevent one case of gastric cancer was 124. The effect size we observed remained robust through the majority of sensitivity analyses we performed. We were unable to confirm or refute whether any benefit of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy depended on the presence or absence of preneoplastic lesions at baseline. However, it is important to highlight that there would be reduced power to detect significant differences in most of the subgroup analyses we conducted, and the original trials were not powered with secondary endpoints, such as mortality from gastric cancer or effect on oesophageal cancer, in mind. Finally, there were few cases of subsequent oesophageal cancer, and adverse events data were poorly reported in the studies we identified. We also did not show any impact of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication on all cause mortality. This would be the most robust end-point to evaluate but as gastric cancer accounts for only a small proportion of the overall death rate the sample size for trials would need to be extremely large.</P>

<P>As all but one of the eligible trials we identified were conducted in Asian populations, and the other trial in a South American population, it is not possible to assess the effect of screening and treatment of <I>H. pylori </I>in healthy and asymptomatic individuals in Western populations.

In <LINK REF="STD-Correa-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Correa 2000</LINK>, this was because no placebo comparator was used for the active eradication therapy regimen, and therefore this part of the trial was unblinded, and in <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2004</LINK> it was due to inconsistencies in data reporting at the 2 follow-up points, with 10 gastric cancers reported at 5 years, compared with 9 at 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2008</LINK>).

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were limitations of this review due to the quality and characteristics of the published literature identified, which we have highlighted above. Because of the factorial design of some of the trials, it was also difficult to ascertain whether the significant reduction in the risk of subsequent gastric cancer was due to <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy alone, or to the antioxidants or vitamins that were co-administered in some of the trials. Certainly, the beneficial effect of eradication therapy appeared to be more pronounced in the two studies that co-administered antioxidants and vitamins to participants, suggesting that there may have been some additive benefit derived from these supplements, although power to demonstrate effect modification due to these different treatments is again limited. However, it should be noted that one of these trials contained the majority of gastric cancers, and had the longest duration of follow-up of almost 15 years.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:29:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous systematic review and meta-analysis that examined this issue five years ago reported that there was a benefit of eradicating <I>H. pylori </I>to prevent future development of gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Fuccio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuccio 2009</LINK>). The magnitude of this effect was very similar to that we observed, with a RR of subsequent gastric cancer of 0.65 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.98). However, the authors of the meta-analysis included data from the same trial twice, at both 5 and 10 years of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2004</LINK>). When only the data from either 5 or 10 years of follow-up were included (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2008</LINK>), the effect of eradication therapy on the incidence of gastric cancer was no longer statistically significant, with RRs of gastric cancer in those participants assigned to eradication therapy, compared with those allocated to placebo, of 0.65 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.01) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.08), respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2011</LINK>). The difference in effect size that we observed from these latter two analyses was due to a further eligible study being published in the intervening years (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012a</LINK>), as well as a longer duration of follow-up in another previously eligible study (<LINK REF="STD-You-2006" TYPE="STUDY">You 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although these data suggest that population <I>H. pylori</I> screening and treatment may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, the 95% CIs are wide, and the result is heavily dependent on one study (<LINK REF="STD-You-2006" TYPE="STUDY">You 2006</LINK>). However, there are data from other sources that support our findings. Two open-label RCTs have suggested that <I>H. pylori </I>eradication can reduce the future incidence of a metachronous cancer among people who have had an endoscopic mucosal resection of gastric cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fukase-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fukase 2008</LINK>). On Matsu Island in Taiwan, where population screening and treatment was adopted in 2004, <I>H. pylori </I>prevalence fell from 63% at baseline to less than 14% during the subsequent 4 years, and prevalence of gastric atrophy fell from almost 60% to less than 14% (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>). At the same time, the 5-year average incidence of gastric cancer declined from 40.3 per 100,000 person-years to 30.4, yielding a rate ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.52), at a time when the incidence of gastric cancer elsewhere in Taiwan remained unchanged. However, the intervention did not affect the incidence of intestinal metaplasia, adding support to the theory that there is a 'point of no return' in the histological changes induced by <I>H. pylori</I> beyond which cancer prevention by eradication of the infection is no longer possible. There was no significant effect on mortality from gastric cancer observed during the period of this study, although follow-up was limited to four years, which is shorter than all but one of the studies included in our meta-analysis. Finally, the prevalence of erosive oesophagitis at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy increased from 14% at baseline to 27% by 2008, suggesting possible deleterious effects of population screening and treatment for <I>H. pylori </I>infection, due to a potential for an increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the long term. This was something we aimed to assess in our meta-analysis, but incomplete reporting of oesophageal cancers among our included studies prevented us from achieving this.</P>

<P>Given that any population-based approach to mass screening for <I>H. pylori</I>, with eradication of the infection in positive individuals, will involve healthy subjects, there needs to be greater confidence in the estimate of effect and more information on any potential harms of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication before such a strategy can be advocated as a means of preventing gastric cancer. Further trials are therefore needed in different populations to extend the evidence base, and these should report on both the benefits and harms of such an approach.</P>

<P>The only substantive change from the protocol lies in a slight change in our primary endpoint. The protocol had intended that the systematic review and meta-analysis focus on the effect of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy in preventing gastric neoplasia in the general population. While the population we have reported on is the same, we did not report the effect of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy on all types of gastric neoplasia, but rather on gastric adenocarcinoma only. This was because only one of the six trials that were eligible for the review reported any cases of gastric neoplasia that were not a gastric adenocarcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Saito-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Saito 2005</LINK>). This was a gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, occurring in a single participant, and was not included in any of our analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methods &gt; Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Although it had been omitted in the protocol, we included the intervention 'RBC triple therapy (RBC plus any two of the following: amoxicillin, macrolide, 5-nitroimidazole)' because it is a recognised eradication therapy regimen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methods &gt; Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>The protocol did not prespecify the methods used to handle missing data and sensitivity analysis (for example modified intention-to-treat approach, complete case analysis, imputation). We amended methods for investigating heterogeneity (for example the cutoff for statistical significance of I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic changed from P less than 0.2 to less than 0.1).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methods &gt; Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The protocol did not prespecify subgroup analysis 'according to whether trial participants were co-administered antioxidants or vitamins within the trial'. We added this due to the nature of the design of some of the included RCTs, which were factorial trials.</P>

<P>976 were randomised but only 852 were eligible and treated after randomisation (7 refused and 117 ineligible). 852 were included in the ITT analyses, and all randomised participants were included in the sensitivity analyses. 631 participants completed the trial and were included in the complete case analysis.</P>
<P>221 participants withdrew before their 72-month evaluation: 102 quit treatment, 59 were lost to follow-up, 34 dropped out of the study because of pregnancy and other medical conditions, 18 died of causes unrelated to gastric cancer, and 8 developed cancer other than gastric cancer. The average rate of loss was 4.3% per year over the 6-year trial. Withdrew in 72 months = 117 (26.8%) vs 104 (25%) in all <I>H. pylori</I> eradication arms vs control arms.

<SUP>1</SUP> As all but one study was conducted in East Asia, it is not possible to assess the effect of searching for and eradicating <I>H. pylori</I> in Western populations.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Modified ITT analysis.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> The quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias: Three trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. In addition, because of the factorial design of some of the trials, it is difficult to determine whether the reduction in relative risk of subsequent gastric cancer was due to <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy alone. The eradication regimens used varied considerably between the individual trials, although this reflects the fact that several of these studies were designed before the widespread adoption of proton pump inhibitor triple therapy, which was first described in 1994, as the gold standard for H. pylori eradication.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> No significant heterogeneity was seen between studies.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> The beneficial effect seemed to be more pronounced in the two studies that co-administered antioxidants and vitamins to participants, but it should be noted that one of these contained the majority of gastric cancers and had the longest duration of follow-up. There was no significant benefit of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy in preventing subsequent occurrence of gastric cancer when only those participants either with or without preneoplastic lesions at baseline were considered in the analysis. There were no significant subgroup differences.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Funnel plots were not produced, as there were less than 10 studies included in the analyses.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> The quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias: one trial was at high risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk.<BR/>
