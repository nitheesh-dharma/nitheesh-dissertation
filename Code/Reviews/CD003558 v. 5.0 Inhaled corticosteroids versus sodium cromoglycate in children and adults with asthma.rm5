I have therefore reverted to my last version and imported your new text. I have edited this following peer review feedback and removed the under 2's from the inclusion criteria. Toby has also changed the total ICS doses to mcg in the tables. Finally I have taken out the paradoxical SCG dose findings from the abstract as I think they are spurious (as you suggest in the discussion).&lt;br&gt;I have run spell check and done some copy editing and this is now ready for the module (numbers under 10 reported as nine not 9 for example).&lt;br&gt;Many thanks for all your hard work.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;17 Jan 2006&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making the changes Toby. Only a couple had decimal points out (Mitchell 76 and Price 95) so I have changed them and this can be submitted, but we should wait and see if Jim responds to my question about the Chi calculations first please.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=======================================&lt;br&gt;Post peer review (16/01/2006): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the highlighted comments. Could you take out the under 2&amp;#8217;s in the inclusion criteria and change the mg to mcg in the tables as suggested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;====================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Jan 2006&lt;br&gt;(Old notes imported)&lt;br&gt;Thanks for changing the analysis method to GIV and restricting the sub-group testing to FEV1 and PEF. This now reads very well and i have made no changes to the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see the units are now all in Litres and L/min respectively and represent absolute measurements post treatment. I have changed the labels accordingly so please verify that this is the case!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally I double checked the between subgroup tests for dose of ICS and my results do not quite match those reported. I found for FEV the Chi from the subgroups to be 4.88 plus 1.05 making 5.93 and when subtracted from the total of 8.75 this leaves residual Chi of 2.82, df =1, P 0.09&lt;br&gt;Did you use different software?&lt;br&gt;For PEF the results of subgrouping for ICS are misreported compared to the Forest plot, there are 5 studies in each group adn the low dose pooled result is 12.03 not as reported. Likewise I make the residual Chi 17.45, df=1, P 0.00003!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am keen to get this revised version out for peer review asap to catch the next module submission so could you respond to the above comments and we will then do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for an excellent review,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;======================================================&lt;br&gt;1/19/05&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Francine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your helpful suggestions and all the work that you have contributed to this study, both for the protocol and now for the review. We would be happy to include you as an author for the published review if you agree. We have added an additional subgroup analysis on optimal SCG doses per your suggestion. I think that it strengthens the conclusions even further. We were &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. For this version, we have incorporated your changes including altering the wording for the main results and the subgroup results to reflect absolute values and not change scores. Hope this is now clearer. &lt;br&gt;2. You are correct that the subgroup analysis goes in the opposite direction from that which would be expected for any carry-over effects. We found that SCG doses were correlated with trial type for adults studies. This means that cross-over trials used optimal SCG doses while parallel group trials did not. For the meta-regression, we dropped trial type and used SCG dosage type instead. &lt;br&gt;3. We have beefed up the discussion to state the robustness of the findings across outcomes and subgroup analyses.&lt;br&gt;4. We have given more details regarding the SCG dosages. In particular, we have categorized each study as using optimal (80 mg/day) or suboptimal SCG dosing.&lt;br&gt;5. We have added a couple of references that you suggested.&lt;br&gt;6. We have added links to references to studies as you suggested.&lt;br&gt;7. We have clarified the dosing of ICS BDP-equivalent dosing.&lt;br&gt;8. We attemped to estimate fail-safe N's, but the results gave negative values. I suspect this is a limitation of the method with modest effect sizes and limited number of contributing studies. You may want to check for yourself. I decided to leave this out.&lt;br&gt;9. We have revised the implications for practice and future studies per your recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;Jim Guevara&lt;br&gt;corresponding author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: Inhaled corticosteroids vs sodium cromoglycate in children and adults with asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Inhaled corticosteroids versus sodium cromoglycate for asthma in children and adults (WITH FD 240205)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12/22/2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have revised the review per our last discussion. Here are the changes that we have made:&lt;br&gt;1) We have stratified the main comparisons by trial type (parallel and cross-over) and have therefore deleted this as a subgroup comparison.&lt;br&gt;2) We have included WMD to pool FEV1 and PEF results for children and adults across trial type. &lt;br&gt;3) We have stratified asthma symptom scores and rescue bronchodilator results by trial type (parallel vs. cross-over) and pooled these results by SMD only within each trial type. &lt;br&gt;4) We have restricted subgroup comparisons to the 2 lung function outcomes: by asthma severity, ICS dosage, SCG dosage, study quality.&lt;br&gt;5) We now report the results of the meta-regressions only for FEV1 and PEF within the subgroup comparisons. We have revised the tables for the meta-regression results.&lt;br&gt;6) We have made some minor changes to the discussion section to clarify the results, particularly with regard to the subgroup findings.&lt;br&gt;7) We have gone back over all data to verify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please review and let us know of any further changes that you require. I will also forward this review to Francine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Holidays,&lt;br&gt;Jim&lt;br&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 16 June&lt;br&gt;Dear Jim,&lt;br&gt;I am afraid that my response below will not be very palatable to you, but I do not think it is possible for you to acheive what you are setting out to do by combining parallel and cross-over trials in RevMan without using GIV. This is not an approach that is advised in section 8 of the handbook and for the reasons outlined below just will not work. Between subgroup comparisons are hopelessly confounded in my view. There are several different options on the way forward which you will need to think about. I have outlined these at the end of this section. Sorry that more work will be involved.&lt;br&gt;Mitchell stands out in the FEV1 outcome as having a much smaller SD than the other studies. The same applies to De Baets for PEF. This is more apparent when WMD is used. Why is this? I think I need to see how the crossover data was extracted from the papers - was there a paired t-test result? If so how has this been entered into RevMan (since the data entry forms are designed for parallel trials). I agree that we should not use first arm data. I do not have a problem with putting cross-over and parallel results together as long as it is done properly and I cannot tell if this is the case without details of how the data was extracted and what was entered into RevMan. The idea of a pooled within and between study variance is not incorporated into the analysis in RevMan. How did the authors derive the GIV results below? Could I see the raw data please. Although it may not change the conclusions I am aware we have vociferous critics of both our methods and in particular the findings in relation to SCG so I am not prepared to proceed without a clearer understanding of the cross-over data. For example how were the Ng entries for rescue bronchodilator use derived. This outcome would be better as WMD but why does Leiflin have such different results from the other studies. They are all parallel except Ng so I guess the unit of measurement is different? Is this absolute use rather than change in use. If so again the results should NOT be combined using SMD as the units are clearly not the same........ This would explain the large heterogeneity when WMD is used for this outcome.&lt;br&gt;The Kuzwemko SD for symptom scores looks like an outlier being four times as large as the control mean. Why is this?&lt;br&gt;This problem is even worse in the subgroups as SMD is going to be counfounded by the different size of SD between trials (the unit of measurement) which I am afraid renders the between sub-group comparisons uninterpretable.&lt;br&gt;Toby could you switch off the totals for single studies and 1#8 should be set to WMD as the same units are used in both parallel studies. Also outcome 1#15 and 17 needs the labels reversing. We need to be clear about version control before this is done so that Jim does not work on a different version.&lt;br&gt;OPTIONS:&lt;br&gt;1. Restrict the analysis to parallel trials. You can then use RevMan to pool and compare subgroups (except for avoiding SMD if there are change from baseline and absolute results such rescue bronchodilators). Cross-over results can be reported in the text.&lt;br&gt;2. Put in the crossover trials using GIV where the paper gives paired t-test results and a measure of uncertainty (confidence interval or exact p value). If paired t-tests are not reported try to get them from authors. If you cannot you are only left the option of first arm data. I cannot tell at present how many cross-overs had useable paired results.&lt;br&gt;3. Restrict your analysis to WMD as SMD is unsuitable as a metric when you know that the SD is unlikely to be the same in the different types of study (cross-over and parallel, absolute and change from baseline). This would mean leaving out the % predicted FEV1 trials or seeking FEV1 data in litres from the authors.&lt;br&gt;Please could you send me the extracted results from all the cross-over trials if you have them in a spreadsheet, with some indication as to how they were derived.&lt;br&gt;Sorry to disappoint,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;==================================================================================&lt;br&gt;In dealing with both cross-over and parallel trials, we combined data&lt;br&gt;from both types of studies into a single combined meta-analysis&lt;br&gt;according to the method of Curtin and Altman (Statistics in Medicine&lt;br&gt;2002, 21:2131-44). According to this method, either WMD or SWMD may be&lt;br&gt;used to pool data. Other methods such as restricting data to the first&lt;br&gt;cross-over period or performing separate meta-analyses for cross-over&lt;br&gt;and parallel group studies may be prone to power issues and potentially&lt;br&gt;biased estimates. Since data for the continuous outcomes were reported&lt;br&gt;in different units (eg. absolute FEV1 vs. %predicted FEV1) we used SWMD.&lt;br&gt;You are correct in stating that the standard errors may differ between&lt;br&gt;study types. To account for these differences, Curtin and Altman call&lt;br&gt;for the use of a pooled between- and within-study variance to&lt;br&gt;standardize cross-over trial estimates. This can be accomplished with&lt;br&gt;the use of a random-effects model to standardize the estimates. In our&lt;br&gt;review, we used both fixed and random effects models, but we could&lt;br&gt;certainly only report the random effects model to be consistent with&lt;br&gt;this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did estimate random effects models for FEV1, asthma symptom scores,&lt;br&gt;and rescue bronchodilator use in children using generic inverse and&lt;br&gt;random effects SWMD (see below). There does not appear to be much&lt;br&gt;difference between these two methods for these outcomes. Would you be&lt;br&gt;willing to accept random effects SWMD models for continuous outcomes? It&lt;br&gt;will require a significant amount of work for us to go back and estimate&lt;br&gt;generic inverse variance models for all of our continuous outcomes in&lt;br&gt;both the main effects and the subgroup analyses. I don't think that it&lt;br&gt;will change the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome SWMD Generic&lt;br&gt;Inverse Variance&lt;br&gt;FEV1 0.27 (0.12, 0.43) 0.28 (0.12,&lt;br&gt;0.43)&lt;br&gt;Asthma Sx -0.38 (-0.52, -0.24) -0.37 (-0.59,&lt;br&gt;-0.15)&lt;br&gt;RB -0.27 (-0.41, -0.14) -0.25&lt;br&gt;(-0.49, -0.01)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;========================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing 28 April 2005 ( Liz has checked search strategy and references)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives - Fine.

This would be an awfully long trolley wait!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - Liz has checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Good. I have added detection bias to the 3 unblinded studies that did not have this in the final column. Please double check this is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Look fine. I see that Generic Inverse Variance has not been used. Details of data entry for cross-over studies may not be correct? Also SMD is not a suitable metric to compare or combine parallel group and cross-over studies as the variance would not be expected to be the same in the two types of study and is therefore NOT a common unit of measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : look good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results defer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion defer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: How were the subgroups analysed?

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have been advocated as medications to control persistent asthma symptoms among children and adults, yet information on which class of drugs is superior has been conflicting. This study pooled randomized controlled trials that directly compared the effects of ICS to SCG on measures of lung function, asthma control, and health care use. Results suggest that ICS were superior to SCG on measures of lung function and morbidity. The results were consistent among children and adults. There were no differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, although inconsistent reporting and insufficient long-term monitoring prevents firm conclusions on safety from being drawn.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have become established as effective controller medications for children and adults with asthma, but their relative efficacy is not clear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the relative effectiveness and adverse effects of ICS and SCG among children and adults with chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Systematic search of the Cochrane Airways Group's special register of controlled trials (to Feb. 2004), hand searches of the reference lists of included trials and relevant review papers, and written requests for identification of additional trials from pharmaceutical manufacturers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of ICS with SCG in children and adults with chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All studies were assessed independently for eligibility by three review authors. Disagreements were settled by consensus. Trial authors were contacted to supply missing data or to verify methods. Eligible studies were abstracted and fixed- and random-effects models were implemented to pool studies. Separate analyses were conducted for paediatric and adult studies. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression models were fit to explore heterogeneity of lung function outcomes by type of RCT, category of ICS or SCG dosage, asthma severity of participants, and study quality on outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of 67 identified studies, 17 trials involving 1279 children and eight trials involving 321 adults with asthma were eligible. Thirteen (76%) of the paediatric studies and six (75%) of the adult studies were judged to be high quality. Among children, ICS were associated with a higher final mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.07 litres, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.11) and higher mean final peak expiratory flow rate [PEF] (WMD 17.3 litres/minute, 95% CI 11.3 to 23.3) than SCG. In addition, ICS were associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD -1.18 exacerbations per year, 95% CI -2.15 to - 0.21), lower asthma symptom scores, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no group differences in the proportion of children with adverse effects. Among adults, ICS were similarly associated with a higher mean final FEV1 (WMD 0.21 litres, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) and a higher final endpoint PEF (WMD 28.2 litres/minute, 95% CI 18.7 to 37.6) than SCG. ICS were also associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD -3.30 exacerbations per year, 95% CI -5.62 to -0.98), lower asthma symptom scores among cross-over trials but not parallel trials, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no differences in the proportion of adults with adverse effects. In subgroup analyses involving lung function measures, paediatric and adult studies judged to be of high quality had results consistent with the overall results. Lung function measures in children were higher in studies with medium BDP-equivalent steroid dosages than low BDP-equivalent dosages, while adult studies could not be compared by steroid dosage since they all incorporated similar dosages. There were no significant differences in lung function by the asthma severity of participants for adult or child studies.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>ICS were superior to SCG on measures of lung function and asthma control for both adults and children with chronic asthma. There were few studies reporting on quality of life and health care utilization, which limited our ability to adequately evaluate the relative effects of these medications on a broader range of outcomes. Although there were no differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, most trials were short and may not have been of sufficient duration to identify long-term effects. Our results support recent consensus statements in the U.S. and elsewhere that favour the use of ICS over SCG for control of persistent asthma.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have been advocated for the treatment of persistent asthma in children and adults. ICS have been shown to be effective at improving lung function and reducing chronic asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004c</LINK>). Adverse effects of ICS remain a controversial subject. Effects on short-term growth in children have been reported, although long- term growth does not appear to be affected (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 2001</LINK>). In addition, there have been concerns about important but subtle effects on bone architecture and metabolism(<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baraldi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baraldi 1994</LINK>). The safety of SCG has been well established, but the effectiveness of SCG in controlling asthma symptoms may be limited (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Wouden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Wouden 2004</LINK>).This latter concern may have contributed to a decline in the use of SCG and an increase in the use of ICS since the early 1990's (<LINK REF="REF-Helms-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helms 2000</LINK>). Recent clinical guidelines published by the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2003</LINK>), National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the US (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>), the Canadian Asthma Consensus Group (<LINK REF="REF-Canada-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canada 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>), and the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>) have generally favoured the use of inhaled steroids as first line therapy for the treatment of persistent asthma. SCG has been considered by these authoritative groups as an alternative drug, particularly when concerns about adverse effects of ICS have been raised. Studies directly comparing the efficacy ICS and SCG have produced mixed results. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that directly compared ICS with SCG for the treatment of persistent asthma in children and adults. The findings from this study can be used to guide the selection of medications to control persistent asthma symptoms.</P>

<P>We considered randomized controlled trials that used either parallel group or crossover designs with a washout period of one week or more between therapies as eligible for inclusion</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We considered all trials enrolling children, adolescents, and adults as potentially eligible for inclusion, provided that children and adolescents were examined separately from adults. All patients had to have a diagnosis of chronic asthma, ranging from intermittent asthma to severe persistent asthma. We considered studies eligible if they based the diagnosis of asthma on physician opinion or objective criteria related to symptoms, airway reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Studies that delivered interventions to patients at community/primary care sites, hospital outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and inpatient settings were included. We excluded studies if they enrolled participants with pulmonary diagnoses other than asthma and did not report on participants with asthma separately.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We only considered studies that reported on direct head-to-head comparisons of ICS with SCG. We considered studies without regard to the type of delivery devices used in the trials, including metered dose inhalers (MDI), MDI with spacer/chamber, dry-powder inhalers (DPI), or wet nebulisers. We only considered studies with an intervention period of four weeks or longer in order to ascertain a minimum duration for asthma control. We excluded studies employing medication co-interventions (e.g. theophylline or montelukast), but we considered studies that incorporated rescue short acting inhaled or oral beta agonists and rescue systemic steroids.</P>

<P>Outcomes were measured as dichotomous and continuous where possible, e.g. the proportion with exacerbations and the mean exacerbations per treatment group. For continuous measures, we only included final scores and not change scores, since change scores were not routinely reported. We determined the asthma severity of participants in each study by individual study report, examination of mean FEV1 or PEF baseline measurements (&gt;80% predicted as mild, 60-80% predicted as moderate, &lt;60% predicted as severe), or reported chronicity of mean baseline asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>). We categorized asthma severity as "mild-moderate" or "moderate-severe" depending on whether patients with severe asthma were included. We categorized asthma severity as "unclear" if asthma severity was not reported and could not be deduced from examination of study baseline lung function measurements or reported chronicity of asthma symptoms.</P>

<P>We screened the title and abstract of each citation identified through the search strategy for eligibility. We obtained the full text of each study determined to be possibly eligible, and we had studies translated into English if necessary. We assessed each article independently for study eligibility (JG, RK, JZ). Disagreement was settled by consensus. Information on randomization methods, blinding or masking, setting, participants (age, sex, ethnicity/race, and asthma severity), intervention duration, medications (agent, dose, method of delivery, co-intervention medications, length of treatment), follow-up procedures and withdrawals, and outcomes were abstracted onto pre-printed data collection forms. To obtain or verify information on reported outcomes and methods, we contacted all corresponding authors by mail or e-mail.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 17:04:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We estimated study-specific effect sizes using final endpoint values for each outcome of interest with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used the weighted mean difference (WMD) or the standardized weighted mean difference (SMD) if outcomes across studies were reported in different units. For dichotomous outcomes, we used the relative risk (RR). In order to achieve a common interpretable metric across studies reporting on lung function outcomes, we converted average % predicted FEV1 and PEF measures to absolute values of FEV1 (litres) and PEF (litres/minute) using polynomial models derived from spirometric reference values (<LINK REF="REF-Hankinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankinson 1999</LINK>). We selected the models for male Caucasian subjects &lt;20 years of age, since all included studies reported a majority of enrolled patients as being white and male. There were few differences in lung function measures if models for white female subjects &lt; 20 years of age were used. We used the average age and height of participants in each study to derive the expected values of FEV1 and PEF. If height was not reported, we used the median height for boys for a given age from population reference values. We then multiplied the % predicted FEV1 and PEF (% predicted FEV1 SD and PEF SD) reported in these trials by the expected values of FEV1 and PEF to arrive at the absolute estimates (absolute SDs). Since two-period cross-over studies may not report appropriate variance measures from paired analyses, we imputed paired standard errors from unpaired standard errors (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). If the correlation between treatment periods in cross-over trials was not reported, we assumed that the correlation was 0.50 (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>When two or more trials reported results for an outcome, we pooled effect sizes using both fixed-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hasselblad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasselblad 1995</LINK>) and random-effects (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) models, since there is little agreement on which model is preferable. For consistency, we reported effect sizes from the fixed-effects model in the text. Where effect sizes differed statistically, we also reported effect sizes from the random-effects model. Data from both treatment periods in cross-over trials were pooled with data from parallel group trials if data were reported in absolute values in order to estimate a common effect across all studies and to improve efficiency. Data from cross-over and parallel studies were pooled separately using SMD if data were reported in different units, since methods to reliably pool data from parallel and cross-over trials using SMD were not available. We made separate comparisons for children/adolescents and adults.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-28 17:04:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two authors (JG, SN) assessed the methodological quality of included trials independently. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic and any disagreement was resolved by consensus. The primary measure of quality was a 5-point scale that evaluated the reported quality of randomization (0 if not randomized, 1 if reported randomized, 2 if randomized and method appropriate), blinding (0 if not blinded, 1 if reported blinded, 2 if blinded and method appropriate), and description of withdrawals and dropouts (0 if not described and 1 if appropriately described) [<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>]. A score of 3-5 was considered suggestive of high quality, while a score of 1-2 was suggestive of low quality. We also evaluated the quality of allocation concealment using the Cochrane approach [<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>]:</P>
<P>Grade A: adequate concealment</P>
<P>Grade B: uncertain concealment</P>

<P>We tested for heterogeneity using the I2 Test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

We categorized heterogeneity as low (I2: 25-50%), moderate (I2: 51-75%), or high (I2&gt;75%). To detect biases in the publication and identification of trials, funnel plot asymmetry was determined for outcomes with at least three contributing studies by regressing the standard normal deviate on the precision (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-28 17:05:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We undertook preplanned subgroup analyses for lung function comparisons: FEV1 and PEF. We performed subgroup comparisons by stratifying studies on key characteristics separately for children/adolescents and adults in order to estimate the magnitude of their effects on outcomes and to explore heterogeneity. We were primarily interested in whether outcomes varied across trials with respect to the asthma severity of participants, beclomethasone (BDP)-equivalent ICS dosage category, study quality, and the type of trial. We also performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis to investigate if differences in outcomes were evident between studies with optimal SCG dosages (20 mg QID) and studies with sub-optimal dosages (&lt;80 mg per day) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Wouden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Wouden 2004</LINK>). </P>

<P>We tested for statistical significance among subgroups by partitioning the overall heterogeneity into within and between group differences (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). We considered between group differences of P&lt;0.1 as indicative of significant group differences in outcomes. We stratified these comparisons by:</P>
<P>a) Asthma severity (mild/moderate versus moderate/severe versus unclear)<BR/>b) BDP Steroid-equivalent dosage (medium versus low)<BR/>c) Study quality (low versus high Jadad score)<BR/>d) Type of trial (parallel-group versus cross-over)<BR/>e) SCG Dosage (optimal versus sub-optimal)</P>
<P>We consulted inhaled steroid dosage equivalence charts to determine BDP-equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2003</LINK>). BDP-equivalent dosages of 200-400 mcg per day were considered low dose, while BDP-equivalent dosages of 401-800 mcg per day were considered medium dose. We stratified on type of trial to assess for the presence of carry-over effects or other biases in cross-over trials (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>To assess the independent effect of key characteristics, we developed meta-regression models (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1994</LINK>). We fit separate models for children and adults for FEV1 and PEF outcomes. We regressed effect sizes on the following characteristics: asthma severity, BDP-equivalent ICS dosage category, type of trial, and study quality. We explored for co linearity of characteristics using correlation matrices and found moderate correlation (r&gt;0.65) involving type of trial and most other variables. For this reason, we dropped type of trial from all models. For some models (adult outcomes), we dropped ICS dosage category, because there was no variability among the trials for these measures. We performed the main meta-analysis using RevMan Analysis 1.0, but we conducted the funnel plot asymmetry and meta-regression using Stata version 8.</P>

<P>Twelve trials involving 1043 patients reported data comparing inhaled steroids to cromolyn on measures of asthma control. Only one study reported on the main outcome, asthma exacerbations. In that study, ICS were associated with fewer exacerbations (N=1 trial, WMD -1.18 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -2.15 to -0.21) than SCG. ICS were associated with lower asthma symptom scores than SCG in both parallel group trials (N=6, SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.24) and cross-over trials (N=3, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.05). Similarly, ICS were associated with less rescue bronchodilator usage than SCG in both parallel group (N=5, SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.07) and cross-over trials (N=1, SMD=-0.64, 95% CI -1.28 to 0.00). Tests of between group variability were not significant (P&gt;0.10), suggesting that parallel group and cross-over studies were reporting similar estimates of asthma symptoms score and rescue bronchodilator use. There were no group differences in asthma-free days (N=2, WMD 0.69 days per patient per year, 95% CI -0.33 to 1.71), days of school absence (N=1, WMD 0.27 days per patient per year, 95% CI -3.33 to 3.87), nights disturbed by asthma (N=1, WMD -2.56 nights per patient per year, 95% CI -8.81 to 3.69), or quality of life score (N=1, WMD -0.10 mean scores, 95% CI -2.27 to 2.07). There was modest statistical heterogeneity among the trials pooled for asthma symptom scores (I2=36.5%) but none among trials pooled for rescue bronchodilator use (I2=0%). Results from random-effects models were consistent with those from fixed-effects models for all outcomes. No evidence for publication bias was found for asthma symptom scores (intercept 0.2, 90% confidence interval -2.0 to 2.4) or rescue bronchodilator use (intercept 0.6, 90% confidence interval -3.6 to 4.7). No trials reported on days of restricted activity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Measures of Lung function (paediatric studies)</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen trials involving 813 children reported data comparing inhaled steroids to cromolyn on measures of lung function. ICS were associated with a higher mean final FEV1 (N=10 trials, WMD 0.07 litres, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11) and higher final endpoint PEF (N=10, WMD 17.3 litres/minute, 95% CI 11.3 to 23.3) than SCG. Tests of between group variability were not significant (P&gt;0.10), suggesting that parallel group and cross-over studies were reporting similar final endpoint estimates of FEV1 and PEF. There was no statistical heterogeneity among trials reporting on FEV1 (I2=0%), but there was moderate heterogeneity among trials reporting on PEF (I2=57.9%). The pooled estimates obtained by the random-effects model were consistent with those from the fixed-effects models. There was no evidence of publication bias for FEV1 (intercept 0.7, 90% confidence interval -0.2 to 1.6), but there was possible publication bias involving PEF (intercept 1.7, 90% confidence interval 0.6 to 2.9).</P>

There was no heterogeneity among trials pooled for emergency department visits or general practitioner visits, and fixed- and random-effects models were consistent in their findings. Because only two studies reported utilization outcomes, we did not estimate funnel plot asymmetry or perform meta-regression.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Measures of Adverse effect (paediatric studies)</HEADING>
<P>Six trials involving 150 children reported data comparing inhaled steroids to cromolyn on adverse effects. There were no group difference between ICS and SCG in the proportion of patients with any adverse effect (N=6 trials, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.45), proportion with oropharyngeal effects (N=2, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.25 to 6.48), growth (N=1, WMD -0.50 cm per patient per year, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.03) or adrenal suppression (N=1, WMD -5.40 nmol urinary cortisol per patient per day, 95% CI -41.14 to 30.34). There was no heterogeneity among the trials pooled for oropharyngeal effects (I2=0%), but there was modest heterogeneity among trials pooled for total adverse events (I2=47.0%). Estimates obtained from random-effects models were consistent with those from fixed-effects models. We did not estimate funnel plot asymmetry or perform meta-regression for any measure of adverse effects due to the limited number of contributing studies. No trials reported data on osteopenia.</P>

Comparisons of differences in FEV1 by asthma severity could not be made, since none of the trials reporting on this outcome included severe asthmatics.

Similarly, the five trials using medium ICS dosages had a higher final estimate of PEF favouring ICS (WMD liters/minute 48.0 versus 12.0, Chi-square=17.45 (1df), P&lt;0.001) than the four trials using low ICS dosages. In meta-regression models, ICS dose was associated with FEV1 (coefficient 0.16, P=0.07) and PEF (coefficient 28.2, P=0.01) after controlling for asthma severity and Jadad Score, suggesting that ICS given at a medium dosage is associated with greater improvement in lung function than ICS given at a low dosage (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Five trials involving 155 adults reported data comparing inhaled steroids to cromolyn on measures of asthma control. Only one study reported on the main outcome, asthma exacerbations. In this study, ICS were associated with fewer exacerbations (N=1 trial, WMD -3.30 exacerbations per patient per six months, 95% CI -5.62 to -0.98) and a reduced risk of exacerbations (N=1, RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.82) compared with SCG. ICS were associated with lower asthma symptom scores among cross-over trials (N=3, SMD - 0.58, 95% CI- 0.96 to -0.20) but not among parallel group trials (N=1, SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.55). Variability between the single parallel group study and the three cross-over trials was not significant (Chi-square=1.86(1df), P&gt;0.10). ICS were associated with less rescue bronchodilator use among cross-over trials (N=3, SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.14) than SCG. There was modest heterogeneity among trials reporting asthma symptom scores (I2=44.5%) and rescue bronchodilator use (I2=46.0%). The pooled estimates obtained from random-effects models were consistent with those from fixed-effect models. One additional study, which could not be pooled due to absent point estimates, reported that both ICS and SCG demonstrated similar reductions in asthma symptom scores and rescue bronchodilator use. No evidence of publication bias was found for asthma symptom scores (intercept 1.7, 90% confidence interval -11.5 to 14.9) or rescue bronchodilator use (intercept -1.8, 90% confidence interval - 54.5 to 50.9). No trials reported data on measures of days of work absence, asthma free days, nights disturbed by asthma, proportion with rescue bronchodilator use, or days of restricted activity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Measures of Lung Function (adult studies)</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials involving 321 adults reported data on measures of lung function. Inhaled steroids were associated with a higher final mean FEV1 (N=7 trials, WMD 0.21 litres, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) and a higher final mean PEF (N=5, WMD 28.2 litres/minute, 95% CI 18.7 to 37.6) than SCG. The four studies employing crossover designs were associated with a higher mean final estimate of FEV1 (WMD liters 0.25 versus -0.05, Chi-square=8.33(2df), P&lt;0.005) than the three trials with parallel design. However, the four cross-over studies and the single parallel study had similar final estimates of PEF (WMD 28.8 versus -17.2, chi-square=1.20(1df), P&gt;0.25). There was moderate heterogeneity for FEV1 (I2=65.1%) but modest heterogeneity for PEF (I2=27.7%). The pooled estimates obtained by the random-effects model were consistent with the fixed effect model. One additional trial that could not be pooled due to absent point estimates reported that ICS were associated with an increase in FEV1 by 0.31 litres and an increase in PEF by 75 litres/minute, while SCG had no change on either lung function measure. No evidence of publication bias was found for FEV1 (intercept -1.6, 90% confidence interval -4.2 to 1.0) or PEF (intercept 0.9, 90% confidence interval -1.5 to 3.4).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 17:09:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In this systematic review of 17 paediatric and eight adult randomized controlled trials comparing ICS to SCG for the treatment of chronic asthma, the use of ICS was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations than SCG. However, only single studies reported on this outcome among paediatric and adult studies. For other outcomes, ICS were associated with better lung function, fewer asthma symptoms and less use of rescue bronchodilators than SCG. The results were consistent among adult and child studies and were similar for estimates pooled by either fixed- or random-effects models. ICS were not different than SCG on measures of health care utilization in the few paediatric trials reporting this outcome; no adult studies reported on health care use. There were no group differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, but the types of adverse effects were reported inconsistently across studies. For example, growth delay, a major concern among children using ICS, was rarely assessed.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore heterogeneity in results with respect to patient and study factors. With only one trial reporting the main outcome for both paediatric and adult studies, subgroup analyses on exacerbations could not be performed. Therefore, we conducted these analyses on lung function outcomes, FEV1 and PEF, for which we had sufficient numbers of contributing studies. Asthma severity did not modify the superiority of ICS over SCG for lung function outcomes. However, the superiority of ICS over SCG was modified by ICS dosage for paediatric studies but could not be assessed for adult studies which were all of similar dosages. Here, lung function improved to a greater degree among studies utilizing moderate ICS dosages than among studies with low ICS dosages. This result was independent of the study quality and asthma severity of participants. There was little heterogeneity in lung function by SCG dosage, except for FEV1 measures among adults (in which all ICS doses were low dose) and PEF measures in children. In these paradoxical cases, the superiority of ICS was magnified in studies using optimal doses of SCG than in studies with sub-optimal SCG, suggesting that the superiority of ICS is independent of SCG dosage and may be modified by other factors. Finally, there was no heterogeneity of lung function measures by study quality, suggesting a robust finding.</P>
<P>The results of this review suggest that there were few differences in adverse effects between ICS in mild to moderate doses and SCG. This was true whether we examined all adverse effects reported by trials or specific adverse effects such as growth, oropharyngeal effects, or adrenal suppression. However, adverse effects in these trials were reported inconsistently, and most trials were short-term. This may have limited our ability to identify adverse effects, particularly those such as growth retardation which require more prolonged monitoring. In this latter instance, only one paediatric study monitored growth for at least one year, and results did not show any difference in growth between ICS and SCG.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review comparing the effects of cromolyn to the gold standard, inhaled steroids. The study had a number of strengths. First, this study benefited from the large number of eligible studies (N=25), which provided sufficient statistical power to identify clear group differences in measures of lung function and asthma control. The large number of contributing studies also allowed us to explore more adequately possible variables affecting heterogeneity in results. Second, this study benefited from a fairly exhaustive search method that allowed us to identify a large number of eligible trials, irrespective of language of publication, and to limit any possible publication bias. In fact, we found evidence for publication bias in only one of several outcomes involving children and adults. In addition, correspondence with authors permitted the verification of methods and data for 68% of included trials, adding credibility to the results. Finally, this study benefited from the robustness of findings across outcomes and subgroup analyses. Indeed, study findings were relatively consistent whether study authors employed parallel group or cross-over designs.</P>
<P>There are a few limitations to discuss. A major limitation of this review was the under-reporting of health care utilization and adverse effects among eligible studies. With only two trials reporting health care use in paediatrics and no trials in adults, there is insufficient data to clarify if ICS reduces health care utilization compared to SCG. It is also not clear whether there are differences in adverse effects between the medications given the inconsistent measurement and insufficient long-term monitoring present in these studies. This limited our ability to draw firm conclusions on the relative safety of ICS compared to SCG, particularly with regards to growth in children. In addition, a number of studies failed to adequately report on study methods such as allocation concealment procedures. This limited our ability somewhat to adequately explore subgroup comparisons based on study quality. Using another measure of study quality, the Jadad Score, results among higher quality studies were consistent with results of lower quality studies. Next, our analysis lacked adequate methods to combine data from parallel and cross-over studies when outcomes were reported in different units. Results, however, among parallel group and cross-over trials for these outcomes were similar. Finally, continuous outcomes were only reported as final values, rather than changes from baseline. Final values are less sensitive than changes measured from baseline; results nonetheless consistently favoured ICS highlighting the robustness of findings.</P>
<P>The findings from this review appear generalisable to a large spectrum of children and adults with persistent asthma. Included studies enrolled children, adolescents, and adults with mild to severe asthma. We are unable to recommend ICS over SCG for infants (&lt;two years old) or elderly adults (&gt;65 years old), since studies included in this review did not enroll subjects in these age categories. Yet, the findings from this review are consistent with recent systematic reviews, which suggest a strong benefit of ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004c</LINK>) over placebo and question the benefit of SCG over placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Wouden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Wouden 2004</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. The results from this systematic review suggest that ICS are superior to SCG on measures of asthma control including asthma exacerbations, asthma symptoms, and the need for rescue bronchodilators.<BR/>2. The results also suggest that ICS are superior to SCG on measures of lung function among both adults and children. <BR/>3. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that ICS are different from SCG on measures of health care utilization such as physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.<BR/>4. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that there are differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG. Adverse effects were reported inconsistently, and most trials were too short to adequately measure the impact of these drugs on long-term effects.<BR/>5. The results suggest that the superiority of ICS over SCG may be independent of asthma severity, since results were generally similar among those with milder and more severe asthma. The results also suggest that the superiority of ICS over SCG may depend on the dosage of inhaled steroid, since results in favour of ICS were generally stronger among studies with moderate doses than among those with low doses. <BR/>6. The results suggest that both low-dose and medium-dose ICS are superior to SCG, but medium -dose ICS may result in greater differences in lung function in children than low-dose.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This systematic review examined paediatric and adult studies separately. The results in favour of ICS were consistent across both types of studies and across a range of subgroup analyses. These data suggest that future studies comparing ICS to SCG for lung function and asthma control outcomes may not be warranted. If future trials are considered, we would suggest addressing the following gaps in knowledge:<BR/>1. There were few paediatric studies and no adult studies reporting on physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Future studies may be considered to investigate the difference between ICS and SCG on health care utilization.<BR/>2. A single paediatric study included in this review reported on health-related quality of life. As patient-centred outcomes are being recognized increasingly as important, future studies may be considered to evaluate the relative effects of these drugs on quality of life.<BR/>3. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and delivery devices were too heterogeneous to allow for adequate comparisons. Future studies may choose to investigate if the types of ICS and associated delivery devices affect the group differences between ICS and SCG, using direct comparisons.<BR/>4. We were unable to pool data from parallel and cross-over studies when outcomes were reported in different units. This limited our statistical power and ability to explore heterogeneity for these outcomes. Methods should be considered for development that will allow standardization and pooling of measures and their variances when they are derived from parallel and cross-over studies designs.<BR/>5. For many studies, we were unable to determine the adequacy of allocation concealment or the method of randomization and blinding. Future studies should more fully report their methods. <BR/>6. Few studies reported on changes in outcomes from baseline. Future studies may wish to include measures of change in addition to final values when reporting outcomes.</P>
