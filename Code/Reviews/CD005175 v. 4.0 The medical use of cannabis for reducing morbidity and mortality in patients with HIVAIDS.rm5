<P>The use of cannabis (marijuana), its active ingredient or synthetic forms such as dronabinol has been advocated in patients with HIV/AIDS, in order to improve the appetite, promote weight gain and lift mood. Dronabinol has been registered for the treatment of AIDS-associated anorexia in some countries. However, the evidence for positive effects in patients with HIV/AIDS is limited, and some of that which exists may be subject to the effects of bias. Those studies that have been performed have included small numbers of participants and have focused on short-term effects. Longer-term data, and data showing a benefit in terms of survival, are lacking. There are insufficient data available at present to justify wide-ranging changes to the current regulatory status of cannabis or synthetic cannabinoids.</P>

<P>The use of cannabis (marijuana) or of its psychoactive ingredient delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as a medicine has been highly contested in many settings.There have been claims that smoked or ingested cannabis, either in its natural form or artificial form (pharmaceutically manufactured drug such as dronabinol), improves the appetites of people with AIDS, results in weight gain and lifts mood, thus improving the quality of life.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-07-12 03:50:29 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of this review were to assess whether cannabis (in its natural or artificially produced form), either smoked or ingested, decreases the morbidity or mortality of patients infected with HIV.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:34:13 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy was conducted to July 2012 and was based on that of the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group. We searched the following databases: CENTRAL/CCTR, MEDLINE and EMBASE. In addition, searching was performed where necessary of journals, reference lists of articles, and conference proceedings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-07-12 03:52:03 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any cannabis intervention, in any form, and administered by any route, in adults with HIV or AIDS, compared with placebo or with a known effective treatment, and conducted in a hospital, outpatient clinic, or home care setting. Quasi-randomised studies using any form of cannabis as an intervention in patients with HIV or AIDS were also included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-07-12 03:54:46 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from the eligible studies were extracted and coded independently by two researchers, using a standardised data extraction form. Data were then analysed using RevMan 5.0. No meta-analyses were performed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-19 03:00:47 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of seven relevant studies were included in the review, reported in eight publications. All were randomised controlled studies, with four utilising a parallel group design, two a within-subject randomisation and two a cross-over design. All of the studies were of a fairly short duration, ranging from 21 days to 84 days. In only four papers (in effect, three studies) were sequence generation and allocation concealment judged to be adequate. The use of cannabis and rapidly acting cannabinoids posed considerable challenges for blinding, as the psychoactive effects are expected to be quickly discernible to study participants, particularly those who have been previous users of such products. Dronabinol was expected to be more easily blinded. The outcomes measured were variable, including change in weight, change in body fat (measured as a percentage of total body weight), change in appetite (measured on a visual analogue scale), change in caloric intake (measured in kcals/kg/24hr), change in nausea and vomiting (measured on a visual analogue scale), change in performance (measured by Karnofsky performance score or specific tests for memory and dexterity) and change in mood (measured on a visual analogue scale).The evidence for substantial effects on morbidity and mortality is currently limited. Data from only one relatively small study (n=139, of which only 88 were evaluable), conducted in the period before access to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), showed that patients administered dronabinol were twice as likely to gain 2kg or more in body weight (RR 2.09), but the confidence interval for this measure (95% CI 0.72 - 6.06) included unity. The mean weight gain in the dronabinol group was only 0.1kg, compared with a loss of 0.4kg in the placebo group. However, the quality of sequence generation and allocation concealment in this study, in which participants were randomised by centre, could not be assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:07:38 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite dronabinol being registered by at least some medicines regulatory authorities for the treatment of AIDS-associated anorexia, and some jurisdictions making allowances for the "medical" use of marijuana by patients with HIV/AIDS, evidence for the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in this setting is lacking. Such studies as have been performed have been of short duration, in small numbers of patients, and have focused on short-term measures of efficacy. Long-term data, showing a sustained effect on AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and safety in patients on effective antiretroviral therapy, has yet to be presented. Whether the available evidence is sufficient to justify a wide-ranging revisiting of medicines regulatory practice remains unclear.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:10:20 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth E Lutge">
<P>The use of cannabis (marijuana) or of its psychoactive ingredient delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as a medicine is a hotly contested issue. Those in support of its medicinal use assert that marijuana is effective in the treatment of wasting syndrome in patients with AIDS and cancer; neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis; and glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2009</LINK>). A counter argument might point to the existence of effective treatments for many, if not all, of these conditions. Not unlinked to this debate is the question of the legalisation or decriminalisation of marijuana as a recreational drug. A recent re-appraisal of the harms to individuals and others in the United Kingdom associated with various substances rated cannabis as less harmful than both alcohol and tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-Nutt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nutt 2010</LINK>). Nonetheless, the current legal status of marijuana constitutes an important philosophical obstacle to the legitimacy of its use as a medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been much anecdotal and some scientific evidence to suggest that smoked or ingested cannabis, either in its natural or artificial (pharmaceutically manufactured drug) form improves the appetites of people with AIDS; results in weight gain; and lifts mood (<LINK REF="STD-Beal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Beal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Struwe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Struwe 1993</LINK>). In these studies, the overall effect of cannabis on patients&#8217; quality of life was claimed to be positive. Indeed, cannabis countered the adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs in certain cases (<LINK REF="REF-Kosel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosel 2002</LINK>). These effects, and the potential positive impact cannabis may make on the lives of people with HIV/AIDS, make it worthy of further investigation. Weighing the positive and negative effects of cannabis, such as immune suppression, psychic discomfort and respiratory changes (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 1987</LINK>), as well as calculating dosage in relation to effect, needs to be done in a logical and scientific way, avoiding the emotive issues that have dogged the debate to date. This review aims to objectively assess the studies that have examined the medical use of cannabis for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 23:30:37 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth E Lutge">
<P>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) which has a complex life-cycle in the human body. The virus is spread by sexual contact, sharing of other body fluids particularly blood (for example during the birth process, through blood transfusions and through the sharing of needs for injection drug use), and breastfeeding. The HI virus infects CD4 lymphocytes, which are lysed (broken down) by cytotoxic T cells, or undergo apoptosis, resulting in significant losses of these cells. During the (often long) latent phase of the disease, the immune system remains functional, but during the end stages of the disease (classified as AIDS), the infected individual is vulnerable to developing various opportunistic infections as well as certain types of cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Abdool-Karrim-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdool Karrim 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:10:20 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Cannabis sativa</I> is a plant species which contains, among 460 known chemicals (<LINK REF="REF-Ben-Amar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben Amar 2006</LINK>), the psychoactive chemical delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC and other cannabinoids, both natural and synthetic as well as endogenous, bind to G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors in the terminals of both central and peripheral neurones (CB1) and in immune cells (CB2), thus mediating the release of various neurotransmitters as well as cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mechoulam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechoulam 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to its potent psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, cannabis was removed from the United States Pharmacopeoia in 1942 (<LINK REF="REF-Short-communication-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Short communication 1999</LINK>), and was banned for any use in Britain and most of Europe when they adopted the United Nations' 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. However, there has been a trend towards the relaxation of these rules, particularly in Canada, some states in the United States, and some European countries such as the Netherlands, where the concept of "medical marijuana" has gained some acceptance (Ben Amar 2006).</P>
<P>While cannabis has been used for centuries for its psychoactive properties, THC and various cannabinoid receptor agonists have been investigated as medicines for a wide range of conditions, including for the relief of pain, gastrointestinal conditions, management of atherosclerosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, relief from symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, relief from symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, for anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, brain injury, management of neuroleptic-associated tardive dyskinaesia, management of glaucoma, cough and cholestatic pruritis (<LINK REF="REF-Pertwee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pertwee 2010</LINK>). However, the major applications of cannabinoid agonists have been as anti-emetics and appetite stimulants. Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid was the first registered in 1981 for the suppression of nausea and vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. THC itself, in the synthetic form of dronabinol, was also registered as an anti-emetic (in 1985) and later (in 1992) as an appetite suppressant in AIDS patients experiencing excessive loss of body weight. Most recently (in 2005), a combination of THC and a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidiol, has been registered for the relief of neuropathic pain in patients with multiple sclerosis and as an aid to pain relief in patients with advanced cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Pertwee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pertwee 2010</LINK>). A cannabinoid antagonist, rimonabant, was initially registered as an anti-obesity agent, but subsequently withdrawn on safety grounds.</P>
<P>Efficacy in relation to nausea and vomiting, appetite stimulation, and pain relief are of particular relevance to patients with HIV/AIDS. Claims have been made regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids in managing cancer chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Machado-Rocha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machado Rocha 2008</LINK>) and in pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Ben-Amar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben Amar 2006</LINK>). Oral THC has been shown to be effective in retarding weight loss in patients with advanced cancer, although it is less effective than megestrol acetate (<LINK REF="REF-Jatoi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jatoi 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-22 07:25:20 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth E Lutge">
<P>Cannabinoid agonists can affect mood and neurology (including pain) by inhibiting the release of a wide range of neurotransmitters at central and peripheral neurones (including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, daspartate and cholecystokinin). However, the mechanism of their anti-emetic or appetite stimulant effects, and their effect on immunology, is still not completely understood (<LINK REF="REF-Mechoulam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechoulam 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-19 03:04:17 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although a synthetic version of THC (dronabinol) has been registered by a number of medicines regulatory authorities for the management of HIV-associated appetite loss and weight loss, there are continued demands for the legalisation of "medical marijuana".Some of the effects of cannabis seem to directly address the symptoms of HIV disease, such as loss of appetite, loss of weight and peripheral neuropathy. However, cannabis may also affect psychomotor performance, which may exacerbate the neuropsychiatric symptoms of HIV. It is therefore important to assess evidence for the benefits of cannabis in HIV/AIDS, compared to its adverse effects.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Haney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 2007</LINK> found that the weights of participants on higher strength marijuana (3.9%) and higher doses of dronabinol (10mg) significantly increased (p&lt;0.01) in comparison with those on lower doses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 2003</LINK> found, as a secondary outcome of their study, that participants using dronabinol or marijuana gained significantly more weight than those in the placebo group.

<P>In Struwe's study (<LINK REF="STD-Struwe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Struwe 1993</LINK>), although all five participants gained weight whilst receiving dronabinol and 3 lost when receiving placebo, the differences were not statistically significant (median gain of 0.5kg versus median loss of 0.7kg from baseline).</P>

A similar decrease of -14.5% (p = 0.074) in AUC8 approached statistical significance. There was a modest decrease in Cmin of 33.7% (p = 0.65) perhaps because of large interpatient variability; this was not statistically significant.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-07 00:27:36 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth E Lutge">
<P>Despite the widespread popular acceptance of the efficacy of cannabis and cannabinoids as anti-emetics and appetite stimulants in patients with HIV/AIDS, the evidence for substantial effects on morbidity and mortality is slim. Data from only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Beal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Beal 1995</LINK>) were amenable to further analysis in this review; the results of the remaining studies were only presented as they were reported in original articles. This relatively small study (n=139, of which only 88 were evaluable), conducted in the period before access to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), showed that patients administered dronabinol were twice as likely to gain 2kg or more in body weight (RR 2.09), but the confidence interval for this measure (95% CI 0.72 - 6.06) included unity. The mean weight gain in the dronabinol group was only 0.1kg, compared with a loss of 0.4kg in the placebo group. However, the quality of sequence generation and allocation concealment in this study, in which participants were randomised by centre, could not be assessed. Interestingly, this was the primary evidence used by the FDA when registering dronabinol for the treatment of AIDS-associated anorexia.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-03-08 01:31:27 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All the studies included were of short duration and in populations that could be expected to vary considerably in HIV staging. Specifically, it is not clear to what extent the symptoms treated were reflective of the pre-HAART era, before access to effective triple antiretroviral therapy became more widely accessible. Where data on interactions with antiretrovirals (<LINK REF="REF-Kosel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosel 2002</LINK>) or the effect on HIV-related clinical parameters, such as CD4 counts or HIV RNA levels (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 2003</LINK>) were presented, these were of such short duration as to make interpretation of any effects uncertain. None of the studies included were able to measure such hard endpoints as progression to AIDS or AIDS-related mortality. The short duration of the studies also precluded extensive documentation of safety issues. The side effects noted were those expected of this class.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-03-07 00:27:36 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although all eight studies included (which represented seven separate studies) were randomised controlled studies, in only four papers (in effect, three studies) were sequence generation and allocation concealment judged to be adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 2003</LINK> , <LINK REF="REF-Kosel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosel 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2009</LINK>). Cannabis and rapidly acting cannabinoids pose considerable challenges for blinding, as the psychoactive effects are expected to be quickly discernible to study participants, particularly those who have been previous users of such products. Dronabinol is expected to be more easily blinded, as peak effects are only seen after 120 minutes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:17:06 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comprehensive searches of journal and conference databases, including all languages, were conducted. Data extraction and the assessment of the methodological quality were done by at least two researchers, which minimised potential bias in the review. Extracting data from the report of the complex within-subject, staggered, double-dummy design used by <LINK REF="STD-Haney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Haney-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 2005</LINK> was very difficult and precluded the pooling of data from these studies. This limited the contribution of these trials to possible meta-analysis and the findings of this review. Many of the outcomes investigated in the trials were subjective in nature; given that blinding is unlikely to have been effective in these trials, our confidence in these subjective outcomes was low. This in itself is a subjective judgement however and another researcher may have felt differently. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:17:24 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As no head-to-head comparative studies with effective anti-emetics were included, this review could not confirm the "superiority" claimed by <LINK REF="REF-Machado-Rocha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machado Rocha 2008</LINK> in respect of the efficacy of cannabinoids in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In Machado Rocha's review, meta-analysis of five studies showed that dronabinol was significantly more efficacious than neuroleptic drugs, in terms of anti-emetic efficiency (n = 325; RR = 0.67; CI = 0.47&#8211;0.96). However, other meta-analyses of the same review showed no superiority of dronabinol over placebo, and no superiority of either nabilone or levonantradol over neuroleptics, in terms of anti-emetic efficiency. As in this review, the authors urged caution in the interpretation of their results, due to the small number of included trials and the small sample size of most trials (most trials had fewer than 50 patients). A further area of agreement with Machado Rocha's review and this review is that of the difficulty of blinding patients in trials involving cannabinoids. This, in combination with the fact that most patients in Machado Rocha's review preferred cannabinoid drugs to the controls, suggests that patients themselves might have been biased in their assessment of the efficacy of the drugs. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-13 00:10:20 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth E Lutge">
<P>Despite dronabinol being registered by at least some medicines regulatory authorities for the treatment of AIDS-associated anorexia, and some jurisdictions making allowances for the "medical" use of marijuana by patients with HIV/AIDS, evidence for the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in this setting is lacking. Such studies as have been performed have been of short duration, in small numbers of patients, and have focused on short-term measures of efficacy. Long-term data, showing a sustained effect on AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and safety in patients on effective antiretroviral therapy, has yet to be presented. The available evidence is not sufficient to justify a wide-ranging revisiting of medicines regulatory practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-23 01:49:36 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth E Lutge">
<P>The means to conduct larger, longer-duration, appropriately blinded and randomised studies of cannabis and cannabinoids in patients with HIV/AIDS are available and such studies should be conducted. However, as a source of data that is easier to collect, consideration should also be given to gathering observational data from cohorts of users of "medical marijuana" in settings where such use is allowed. </P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Marijuana cigarettes, both active and placebo, were identical and smoked through hollow plastic cigarette holders so that marijuana was not visible. Marijuana administration was performed one hour after dronabinol dosing in order to match the expected onset of action and therefore make it difficult for participants to determine whether marijuana or dronabinol was active. Dronabinol capsules were over-encapsulated in opaque capsules with lactose filler. However, all participants were experienced marijuana users and would therefore have been able to identify double placebo administration.</P>
