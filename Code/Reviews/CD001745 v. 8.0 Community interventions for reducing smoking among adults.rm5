<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Although intervention communities often showed substantial awareness of their programme, this rarely led to higher quit rates. Similarly, increased knowledge of health risks, changes in attitudes to smoking, more quit attempts, and better environmental and social support for quitting were not accompanied by reductions in community smoking levels. In the best designed trials, light to moderate smokers did slightly better than heavy smokers (the US COMMIT study), and men did a little better than women (the Australian CART study), but overall smoking rates remained similar between intervention and control communities.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Since smoking behaviour is determined by social context, the best way to reduce the prevalence of smoking may be to use community-wide programmes which use multiple channels to provide reinforcement, support and norms for not smoking.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of community interventions for reducing the prevalence of smoking.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register, MEDLINE (1966-January 2006) and EMBASE (1980-January 2006) and reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Controlled trials of community interventions for reducing smoking prevalence in adult smokers. The primary outcome was smoking behaviour.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted by one person and checked by a second.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-seven studies were included, of which 17 included only one intervention and one comparison community. Only four studies used random assignment of communities to either the intervention or comparison group. The population size of the communities ranged from a few thousand to over 100,000 people. Change in smoking prevalence was measured using cross-sectional follow-up data in 21 studies. The estimated net decline ranged from -1.0% to +3.0% for men and women combined (11 studies). For women, the decline ranged from -0.2% to + 3.5% per year (n=11), and for men the decline ranged from -0.4% to +1.6% per year (n=12). Cigarette consumption and quit rates were only reported in a small number of studies. The two most rigorous studies showed limited evidence of an effect on prevalence. In the US COMMIT study there was no differential decline in prevalence between intervention and control communities, and there was no significant difference in the quit rates of heavier smokers who were the target intervention group. In the Australian CART study there was a significantly greater quit rate for men but not women.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The failure of the largest and best conducted studies to detect an effect on prevalence of smoking is disappointing. A community approach will remain an important part of health promotion activities, but designers of future programmes will need to take account of this limited effect in determining the scale of projects and the resources devoted to them.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-18 17:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="L S">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The prevalence of cigarette smoking reached a peak in industrialized countries during the 1960s, and has since fallen. The prevalence among men at that time was substantially higher than among women, but the difference in prevalence between men and women has narrowed. The reductions in prevalence have been most marked among those members of society with more years of education and higher incomes, but there has been little change among those with fewer years of education and lower incomes. More recently the decline in adult smoking prevalence has been offset by an increase in smoking initiation amongst young people (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 1998a</LINK>), and an increase in smoking prevalence in many less developed countries.</P>
<P>Policy initiatives, such as higher cigarette taxes, have been shown to reduce cigarette consumption (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsend-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 1994</LINK>) and smoking initiation (<LINK REF="REF-Lewit-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewit 1994</LINK>). However, increases in cigarette prices place a greater burden on those with lower incomes who tend to have greater difficulty in stopping smoking. It is less clear whether other types of smoking policy, such as making worksites smoke-free, or having smoke-free public buildings actually reduce the prevalence of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most people who stop smoking make several attempts before they succeed, and most of these attempts are made without special help. For individuals who seek help, a variety of methods have been shown to help stop smoking, including individual advice and counselling, nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants, smoking cessation classes, stay quit support groups. (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silagy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silagy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>). Other methods, such as hypnosis and acupuncture, are also used, but their efficacy has not been demonstrated. (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recognition that decisions to smoke are made within a broad social context led to the development of community-wide programmes to reduce both the initiation and the prevalence of smoking. Ockene has suggested that 'an effective public health approach is a comprehensive one that successfully engages the individual and, through multiple channels in the community, provides reinforcement, supports and norms for not smoking' (<LINK REF="REF-Ockene-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ockene 1992</LINK>). The effectiveness of such multidimensional approaches in reducing initiation in smoking in young people has been considered in a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Sowden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sowden 2003</LINK>). The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of community interventions primarily aimed at reducing smoking among adults.</P>
<P>Most such interventions have focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction and have included cigarette smoking as one of these risk factors (<LINK REF="STD-Carleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carleton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gutzwiller-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gutzwiller 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lando-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maccoby-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Maccoby 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puska-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Puska 1985</LINK>). More recently community-based interventions have focused solely on cigarette smoking (<LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>). In this review, we aim to assess the effectiveness of community-based programmes, and to identify, if possible, what factors in their design, implementation or evaluation may have influenced the smoking behavioural outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Susser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Susser 1995</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To carry out a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of community interventions in reducing the prevalence of smoking. </P>
<P>We addressed the following questions:</P>
<P>1. Do community-based interventions reduce smoking (measured by prevalence, cigarette consumption, quit rates or initiation rates) compared with no intervention in comparison communities?</P>
<P>2. Which characteristics of these studies are related to their efficacy?</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-18 17:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="L S">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Any study which evaluated the effectiveness of community interventions in which smoking behaviour change was a part of the intervention programme using one of the following designs: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>controlled trial randomizing communities or geographical regions </LI>
<LI>a non-randomized controlled trial allocating communities or geographical regions.</LI>
</UL>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults, 18 years or older.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We considered a community intervention as a co-ordinated, multidimensional programme aimed at changing adult smoking behaviour, involving several segments of the community and conducted in a defined geographical area, such as a town, city, county or other administrative district. We had planned to include only those studies which involved community members in intervention planning and implementation, but have relaxed this restriction so that other community-based studies could be included. We have explored differences in smoking behavioural outcomes in relation to whether or not community members were involved in intervention planning. Specific programmes or components of programmes were not specified as these were expected to vary between studies. Detailed descriptions of each intervention were recorded in the Table of Included Studies.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<B>Primary measures of smoking behaviour</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>self-reported smoking status (current smoker, recent ex-smoker - during time of intervention)</LI>
<LI>self-reported cigarette consumption (cigarettes per day). </LI>
</UL>
<P>We report biochemical confirmation of self-reported quit status, but did not exclude studies without this measurement. Biochemical validation was not used in the majority of these studies, and there is evidence to indicate that self report of smoking status in community surveys is reasonably accurate (<LINK REF="REF-Dwyer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dwyer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patrick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Velicer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velicer 1992</LINK>). Where possible we examined smoking behavioural outcomes by sex, age and socio-economic status.</P>
<P>We excluded assessment of other types of tobacco use (pipes, cigars, cigarillos, or chewing tobacco), although reducing consumption of these may be a part of the community programme.</P>
<P>
<B>Mediating variables and Intermediate outcomes</B>
<BR/>We have used the PRECEDE/ PROCEED model as a framework to identify predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors as mediating variables (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1991</LINK>). For predisposing factors we looked for variables concerning knowledge of health risks related to smoking, attitudes such as motivation and intention to quit smoking, and confidence in quitting, and beliefs related to the harmful effects of smoking. For enabling factors, we identified skills in quitting, such as the number of quit attempts and the length of the longest attempt, and barriers to quitting such as the number of other smokers in the household or among friends, or at work. For reinforcing factors, we looked for measures of social influence or pressure to quit smoking, social support for quitting, and for norms concerning smoking.</P>
<P>
<B>Process measures</B>
<BR/>We recorded the methods of community organization and involvement of community members during the process of planning and implementing the interventions. We recorded the different 'communication channels' used, including health professionals, other professionals, lay personnel, health agencies, social agencies, worksites, government, mass media (television, radio, newsprint), other media such as printed materials and videotapes, public events, contests, and health fairs.</P>
<P>We also looked for descriptions of formative research, pilot studies and ongoing evaluation and modification of programme components during the interventions, evidence of the extent of intervention exposure, programme reach, participation and awareness, dose-response relationships, and maintenance of programmes after the interventions were completed. We also recorded intervention costs. </P>
<P>
<B>Morbidity and mortality</B>
<BR/>Reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was the underlying rationale for the community studies focused on cardiovascular risk reduction. However, this was assessed in less than one third of these trials, and in none of the community studies focused on smoking. For this reason, we do not include these as outcomes in this review.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We identified possible studies from the Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialised register, by searching for the terms 'community' or 'communities' in any field (most recent search in January 2006). We checked previous reviews of community-based prevention programmes. (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>)</P>
<P>We searched EMBASE (date of last search January 2006, via OVID) using the following terms:<BR/>CIGARETTE-SMOKING*<BR/>SMOKING-CESSATION*<BR/>SMOKING CESSATION<BR/>SMOKING* in DE<BR/>TOBACCO-SMOKE in DE<BR/>#1 or #2 or #3 or #4 or #5<BR/>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE in DE<BR/>"coronary-artery-disease;" in DE<BR/>"Cardiovascular-diseases-and-cardiovascular-surgery" in EC<BR/>heart adj health<BR/>#7 or #8 or #9 or #10<BR/>PREVENTION in EM<BR/>prevention in de<BR/>control in de<BR/>#12 or #13 or #14<BR/>#6 and #11 and #15</P>
<P>We conducted an additional search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) to identify any heart health programmes not already included in the Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register.</P>
<P>We checked bibliographies of related papers for relevant studies, and made personal contact with content area specialists.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-18 17:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="L S">
<P>There were four stages in the review process:<BR/>Stage 1: reports were pre-screened for relevance by at least one reviewer<BR/>Stage 2: two reviewers independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion<BR/>Stage 3: one reviewer extracted data, and a second reviewer checked them<BR/>Stage 4: inferences across studies were assessed by qualitative narrative synthesis.</P>
<P>The decision not to attempt a quantitative synthesis was based on the marked heterogeneity expected amongst the potentially eligible studies. We expected heterogeneity in the content, length and intensity of the interventions, and in the study design, evaluation strategy (cohort follow up/cross-sectional follow up), measures of smoking behaviour used, and length of follow up.</P>
<P>We compared smoking-related outcomes in studies addressing several risk factors with those in which smoking was the focus.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-18 17:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="L S">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We found 37 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Detailed information about each is shown in the Table of Included Studies. We found two other studies in which more intensive community-based interventions were compared with less intensive ones, but not with an 'untreated' comparison community. We describe the characteristics of these two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Darity-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Darity 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stillman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stillman 1993</LINK>) separately. We excluded several additional studies, and describe their characteristics and the reasons for their exclusion in the Table of Excluded Studies. </P>
<P>
<B>Characteristics of the communities</B>
<BR/>We define community in this context as an aggregation of households and associated services and institutions in a specified geographic area. Eighteen studies (49%) took place in communities in Europe, and 15 studies (41%) in North America. Two took place in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>), one in South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Roussow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roussow 1993</LINK>) and one in India (<LINK REF="STD-Anantha-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Anantha 1995</LINK>). Twenty-three studies (62%) took place in towns or cities while 14 (38%) were in counties or districts. The intervention communities were characterized as urban (10, 27%), rural (12, 32%), mixed (6, 16%) and unclear (9, 24%). The population size varied from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of people. </P>
<P>Seventeen studies (46%) involved only one intervention and one comparison community, but others involved two, three or more communities, or had a single intervention but multiple control communities. The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT, <LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>) study took place in 11 pairs of cities in North America, and the Cancer Action in Rural Towns (CART, <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>) study in 10 pairs of towns in Australia. In some studies, the comparison group was not a comparable community, but randomly selected participants from that country, or state, or a neighbouring district.</P>
<P>
<B>Characteristics of the participants</B>
<BR/>All the studies involved adults, and most studies (89%) included both women and men, of varying age ranges. Two studies targeted men (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>) and two targeted women (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Loughlin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Loughlin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 2000</LINK>). Several studies targeted specific ethnic groups including African Americans (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>), Mexican Americans (<LINK REF="STD-McAlister-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 1992</LINK>) and Vietnamese men (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>). <BR/> <BR/>
<B>Characteristics of the interventions</B>
<BR/>Twenty-four interventions (65%) aimed at cardiovascular risk factor reduction (usually cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking, and sometimes weight loss/obesity and physical activity). Nine (24%), aimed solely at reducing tobacco use, usually cigarette smoking, four (11%) at cancer risk reduction or the promotion of healthy behaviours. Twenty-two studies (59%) used educational and informational approaches to influence behaviour, while the other 15 studies (41%) also used policy initiatives.</P>
<P>
<B>Content of the interventions</B>
<BR/>In 25 studies (68%) there was a description of the theoretical background for the interventions. Fourteen (38%) drew explicitly on social cognitive theory, 11 (30%) on communication theory and 10 (27%) on diffusion of innovation theory. All three theories were specified in seven studies (19%). In 20 (54%) studies, other theories were used including community participation in eight (22%), stages of change in six (16%), social marketing in three (8%), and planned behaviour or reasoned action in four (11%). The PRECEDE model of planning and evaluation for health education and policy interventions was used in seven (19%) studies.</P>
<P>In 23 studies (62%), there was a description of the process of community involvement: coalitions or planning groups in 23 (62%), employment of local community staff in 16 (43%), and task forces or working groups, which included community members, in 12 (32%).</P>
<P>The channels through which the interventions were delivered included: health professionals in 32 studies (86%), volunteers in 19 (51%), and teachers in 16 (43%); community agencies in 21 (57%), schools in 22 (59%), businesses in 18 (49%), local health departments in 20 (54%), local government in 17 (46%), worksites in 18 (49%), restaurants in 15 (41%), churches in nine (24%), hospitals in seven (19%), and retailers in six (16%). A variety of public events, such as lectures or health fairs were used in 32 studies (86%). Screening for cardiovascular risk factors was an integral part of 13 studies (35%).</P>
<P>Mass media were used in 31 studies (84%): 30 (81%) used newsprint, 15 (41%) news stories and another 15 (41%) also used paid advertisements; 22 (59%) used radio, of which 15 (41%) used news stories and seven (19%) news stories and paid advertisements or radio spots, 22 (59%) used television; ten (27%) news stories and 12 (32%) news stories and paid advertisements or television spots. Posters/billboards were used in 22 studies (59%), newsletters or mailings in 10 (27%), and decals or bumper stickers in seven (19%).</P>
<P>Interventions specifically for smoking included self-help materials such as quit-kits in 18 (49%), cessation groups in 17 (46%), both cessation and support groups in three (8%), brochures or booklets about smoking in 16 (43%), individual counselling in ten (27%) [face-to-face six (16%), telephone three (8%), and both in one], audiotapes, videotapes, or slide shows in nine (24%), quit contests in eight (22%), and a quit-line in four (11%).</P>
<P>Smoking policy: Advocacy for smoke-free worksites played a role in 11 studies (30%), for smoke-free public buildings in seven studies (19%), for smoke-free schools in three (8%), and for other anti-smoking policies, such as banning cigarette vending machines in seven (19%).<BR/> <BR/>
<B>Evaluation and follow-up</B>
<BR/>Cross-sectional follow-up, or independent, surveys were used to evaluate the interventions in 14 studies (38%), cohort follow up in 14 (38%), and both cohort and cross-sectional follow-up evaluations in the remaining nine (24%). Few studies reported follow up beyond the immediate post-intervention evaluation except: North Karelia (25 years, <LINK REF="STD-Puska-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Puska 1985</LINK>), CORIS (12 years, <LINK REF="STD-Roussow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roussow 1993</LINK>), Stanford 5-city (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1993</LINK>), Minnesota Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1995</LINK>) and Pawtucket Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Carleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carleton 1995</LINK>) (each 2 years).</P>
<P>Questionnaires were administered in person in 24 studies (65%), by telephone in 15 (41%) by both methods in four and by mail in two. Physical examinations were conducted in 18 studies (49%), and blood tests were done in 16 (43%). A biochemical test to validate smoking status was obtained in 11 studies (30%) (serum thiocyanate five, serum thiocyanate and exhaled carbon monoxide one, exhaled carbon monoxide two, serum cotinine two and salivary cotinine one). In two of these, only subsamples were tested to estimate deception rates, and in two others the test was used as a 'bogus pipeline' (samples collected but not tested, to discourage deception) . In one other study permission to do a test was obtained, but none was taken, again as a 'bogus pipeline'. </P>
<P>
<B>Smoking-related outcomes measured</B>
<BR/>Thirty-one studies (84%) reported differences in smoking prevalence as their major smoking behavioural outcome. Fourteen studies (38%) reported changes in the number of cigarettes (or grams of tobacco) smoked per day, and for three of these, this was the main outcome. Eighteen studies (49%) reported quit rates, and for three of these, this was the main outcome. Five studies (14%) also assessed initiation rates of tobacco use. A few studies included other tobacco use: pipes five (14%), cigars five (14%), cigarillos four (11%), chewing tobacco two (2%), and snuff two (2%).</P>
<P>
<B>Mediating variables and intermediate outcomes measured</B>
<BR/>Among the 37 studies in the main review, we were unable to find any reference to mediating variables in ten (27%). In the remaining 27 studies, for the predisposing factors, some measure of knowledge or belief was obtained at baseline in 18 (49%), but it was only possible to determine whether there was an intervention effect in six (16%), because follow-up data could not be found in the others. Similarly, for attitudes to smoking, there were 20 (54%) studies in which at least one attitudinal measure was obtained at baseline, but only nine (24%) had follow-up data for assessment of an intervention effect.</P>
<P>For enabling factors, we identified some measure of skills in quitting in 13 (35%) studies, and for nine (24%), these measures were obtained post-intervention. As for barriers to quitting, the respondent's smoking environment was assessed in six (16%) studies, and for two of these, post-intervention data were found.</P>
<P>For reinforcing factors, we found some measure of social influence concerning quitting smoking in 13 (35%) studies. In five, the measures concerned social influence or pressure to quit smoking, and two of these studies had post-intervention data. In another seven studies, the measures related to social support for quitting, but only one reported a post-intervention outcome. One other study included measures of general emotional support and social networks with follow-up data in the intervention and reference areas.</P>
<P>Measures of norms concerning smoking were mentioned in four (11%) studies, and two of these had post-intervention results. A fifth study used the respondent's smoking environment as a surrogate for norms, but we have included that study among the two with smoking environmental outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Process Evaluation</B>
<BR/>We found descriptions of formative research or pilot studies to develop or pre-test intervention components in 10 (27%) studies. No reports of such preliminary work were found in the remaining studies. </P>
<P>Evidence of ongoing evaluation and modification of programme components during the course of the interventions was found in nine (24%) studies. The methods used for these ongoing evaluations included telephone and postal surveys of both the target population and programme implementers, semi-structured interviews or focus groups with key stakeholders, and collation of relevant project documentation. Several of the larger studies used computer systems to track events and participation. Individual programme components, such as cessation groups and quit-smoking contests, were evaluated in 10 (27%) studies, community mobilization or project organization in eight (22%), and perceived programme ownership in four (11%). Content analysis of local media, usually newspapers, was undertaken in eight (22%) projects. No reports of the use of such feedback or these other process assessments were found in the remaining studies.</P>
<P>For intervention exposure, we looked for numerical details concerning the extent to which programme components were made available to the intervention community, such as numbers of television spots or radio spots broadcast, programme-related newspaper articles published, health fairs held, self-help kits distributed, cessation or support groups run, or calls to a quit-line and such like. Detailed descriptions of intervention exposure were found in 21 (57%) studies, some numerical detail in another 12 (32%), and little or none in the remaining four (11%).</P>
<P>Plans to assess programme reach, participation or awareness were reported in 26 (70%) studies, but information concerning the magnitude of these measures of programme penetration varied from none to numbers of participants or percentages of the target population. For programme participation we looked for information concerning the number or proportion of individuals participating in intervention activities. For programme awareness, we looked for information concerning the number or proportion of individuals who had heard of, or were aware of the intervention programme. These individuals need not have participated in any intervention activity. We found that 'reach' was used in two ways. In some studies, it was used for programme participation, and in others for programme awareness, so we have included 'reach' in 'participation' or in 'awareness' as appropriate. Estimates of participation rates were found in 13 (35%) studies, and of rates of programme awareness in 17 (46%), with seven of these having estimates of both rates. A summary intervention receipt index was described in one study (COMMIT). No numerical details were found in the other studies in which plans to collect these data were described. No reports of participation or awareness were found in the remaining 11 (34%) studies.</P>
<P>Dose-response: Assessment of a relationship between intervention dose and a smoking behavioural outcome was found in seven (19%) studies, but the strength of the evidence and the measures used to assess intervention dose varied substantially among these. For one study, COMMIT, intervention receipt indices were significantly correlated with quit ratios among the cohort of light/moderate smokers, but not among the heavy smokers, and also with quit ratios among smokers and recent ex-smokers in the cross-sectional follow-up survey. However, the differences in receipt indices between intervention and comparison communities were small. No relationship was found between receipt indices and smoking prevalence in the cross-sectional follow-up data. This is the only study which included the comparison communities in a dose-response analysis. </P>
<P>Among the other six studies, there was some evidence, often slender, for a dose-response in the intervention communities in four (Minnesota Heart Health Program - screening participation and smoking prevalence; Kilkenny Project - overall awareness score and having attempted to change health habits in the past five years; Neighbors for a Smoke-Free North-Side - heard of programme and smoking prevalence; and Healthy Bergeyk - programme awareness and quitting smoking). No dose-response relationship was found in the other two studies (the Bootheel Project - programme awareness and smoking prevalence, and the Dutch Community Study - exposure to programme elements and quitting smoking), neither of which showed net intervention effects for smoking. In one other study, the Stanford Three-city Project (<LINK REF="STD-Maccoby-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Maccoby 1977</LINK>), intervention dose was shown to be related to gains in cardiovascular disease knowledge score. No descriptions of dose-response relationships were found in the other 24 (75%) studies.</P>
<P>Maintenance: Evidence of continuation of intervention components in the original communities was found for 12 (32%) studies, nine cardiovascular risk reduction projects, two smoking reduction projects, and one cancer reduction project. Reports of continuation, but without further details, were found for another five (15%) studies, three cardiovascular risk reduction, one smoking reduction and one cancer reduction. Two other projects (Breathe Easy and the Danish Municipality Project) were unable to maintain programme components for more than a few months after withdrawal of external funding. Three studies (Schleiz Study, Heartbeat Wales and the Kilkenny Project) each reported widespread dissemination of intervention components or materials, but did not provide evidence of local programme continuation. No evidence of maintenance was found for the remaining 12 (38%) studies, although sustainability was a reported aim for two of these. </P>
<P>
<B>Characteristics of excluded studies</B>
<BR/>Twenty-three other studies were identified as possibly relevant but did not meet all the inclusion criteria. Two compared two intensities of intervention and are discussed briefly in the Results section (<LINK REF="STD-Darity-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Darity 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stillman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stillman 1993</LINK>). Four studies did not have a community organization component (<LINK REF="STD-Abramson-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Abramson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kornitzer-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kornitzer 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oganov-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Oganov 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1986</LINK>), and five did not have a comparison community (<LINK REF="STD-Gyarfas-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gyarfas 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muntoni-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Muntoni 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhomberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rhomberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tretli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tretli 1985</LINK>). One study had only seven months of follow up (<LINK REF="STD-McAlister-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 2004</LINK>). One study in Cuba did not have smoking as a target behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 2003</LINK>). Five Chinese studies were identified but two did not have smoking as a target behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2003</LINK>) and three had insufficient details of methods or results available (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 1995</LINK>). In one study, the comparison community had an inadequate sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Feruglio-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Feruglio 1983</LINK>). In the other four studies no outcome evaluation has been conducted or published (<LINK REF="STD-Brownson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brownson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schechter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Schechter 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shea-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shea 1992</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<B>Allocation to intervention or comparison groups</B>
<BR/>Thirty-three studies (89%) used a quasi-experimental design, with non-random assignment of communities to intervention and comparison groups. Among these, four studies did not use a comparison community, but rather a random sample from the population elsewhere in the country, state, a neighbouring district, or zip codes in another city. Only four studies (11%) used a random assignment of matched communities to either the intervention or comparison group. Among these, only the COMMIT (<LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>) and CART (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>) studies had a sufficient number of communities to allow adequately powered statistical comparisons. Both these studies used random assignment between pairs of demographically matched communities, 11 pairs in the COMMIT study and 10 pairs in the CART study. One Dutch study (<LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>) used random assignment between two selected communities, while the other Dutch study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Assema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Assema 1994</LINK>) used random selection of the intervention site from six matched communities and then random selection of the comparison site from three that were outside the selected intervention site's media market. </P>
<P>
<B>Selection of participants in whom outcome measures were made</B>
<BR/>Most studies made a random selection of individuals from lists such as population registries and city rolls. Several studies used random-digit telephone sampling, or random selection of households, or households within randomly selected blocks.</P>
<P>
<B>Response rates and retention rates</B>
<BR/>Thirty-four studies (92%) reported response rates, often combining the rates for intervention and comparison groups. In some studies the overall response rates for baseline and follow-up surveys were also combined. Response rates averaged 77%, standard error (SE) 2% (n=35) for initial intervention group surveys, and 76%, SE 2% (n=34) for comparison group surveys. Among the cohort studies, most (18/23, 73%) noted attrition rates at their follow-up surveys. Converted to retention rates (100 - attrition rate), these averaged 61%, SE 3.1% (n=18) for the intervention groups, and 64%, SE 2.6% (n=18) for the comparison groups. The characteristics of those lost to follow up in the 23 cohort follow-up studies (drop-outs) were described in 14 reports (61%).</P>
<P>
<B>Comparability of intervention and comparison groups at baseline</B>
<BR/>Information on the demographic characteristics of the participating populations at baseline was reported in 31 studies (84%). In 14 (38%), this included age and sex, in two (5%), age, sex and education, and in 15 (41%), age, sex, education and other characteristics, such as marital status, household income or ethnicity. Six studies (16%) provided no demographic data. </P>
<P>In only five studies (14%) were intervention and comparison communities shown to be demographically comparable at baseline. In 17 (46%) one or more demographic characteristics were not comparable, but in the remaining 13 (35%) it was not possible to assess comparability.</P>
<P>There was a comparison of baseline smoking prevalence between intervention and comparison communities in 14 studies (38%).</P>
<P>
<B>Evaluation and analyses</B>
<BR/>For most studies, the evaluation examinations or surveys were done by investigators associated with the research team undertaking the project. In five studies(14%) a separate organization undertook some or all of the survey work and database preparation. It was unclear to what extent the analyses in these trials were undertaken by these separate organizations.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>In 30 studies (81%) the individual was the unit for analysis, although the community was the unit of assignment. In one of these appropriate adjustments were made to inflate the variance of the community means and another used multilevel analysis. In only six studies (16%) did the unit of analysis match the design. In two there were separate analyses at both the individual and the community level. In one study it was not clear which unit of analysis had been used.</P>
<P>Sample size and power calculations were explicitly described in 16 (43%) studies. In nine of these, the power to detect specified effect sizes for smoking prevalence or quit rate ranged from 75% to 90%. </P>
<P>The majority of studies used two-sided P-values, either explicitly (eight studies, 22%), or presumptively (22 studies, 59%). Five studies (14%) hypothesized favourable outcomes and so used one-sided P-values to assess the levels of significance of their results. One study used both one- and two-sided P-values, and for one study no statistical test for the outcome comparisons was reported.</P>

<P>
<B>Smoking behaviour</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Smoking prevalence</I>
<BR/>
</B>In 13 studies (35%), smoking prevalence results were presented for women and men combined, in 14 (38%) for women and men separately, and in four (11%), for women and men separately and also combined. Change in smoking prevalence was not reported in five studies. Among the 23 studies with cross-sectional follow-up data, there were 21 in which changes in smoking prevalence could be estimated. To give an indication of the effect sizes observed at the community level in these 21 studies, we estimated the net decline in smoking prevalence per year, i.e., the decline in prevalence in the intervention groups minus that in the comparison groups, per intervention year, for all adults, for women and for men. For all adults, the net decline in smoking prevalence ranged from -1.0% to +3.0% per year (11 studies). For women, the decline ranged from -0.2% to + 3.5% per year (11 studies), and for men the decline ranged from -0.4% to +1.6% per year (12 studies).</P>
<P>We used data from 12 studies with cohort follow-up data to estimate the effect sizes at the individual level. For all adults, the net decline in smoking prevalence ranged from -0.4% to +1.9% per year (seven studies). For women, the decline ranged from +0.2% to + 3.8% per year (five studies), and for men the decline ranged from -0.3% to +3.6% per year (five studies).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Cigarette consumption</I>
</B>
<BR/>In five studies (14%), results for cigarette consumption, or tobacco use, were presented for women and men combined, and in another five (14%) for women and men separately. Cigarette consumption was not reported in 27 (73%) studies. Because cigarette consumption was reported on a per capita basis in some studies and for smokers in others, we have not prepared any estimates of the range of changes in tobacco consumption, but the individual results can be seen in the Results of Included Studies table.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Quit rates</I>
</B>
<BR/>In eight studies (22%), quit rates were reported for both women and men combined, in another seven (19%) for women and men separately and in two studies (5%) for women and men separately and combined. Quit rates were not reported in 17 studies (46%). Because quit rates were reported in many different ways (point estimates, or quit for seven days, for three months, or for six months), and also over different time periods, we have not prepared any estimates of the range of quit rates. The individual results can be seen in the Results of Included Studies table.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Initiation rates</I>
</B>
<BR/>Only five (14%) studies reported initiation rates for tobacco use; one for women and men combined, two for women and men separately, and one for women and men separately and combined.</P>
<P>
<B>Mediating variables and Intermediate outcomes </B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Predisposing Factors</I>
</B>
<BR/>Knowledge-related outcomes: Among the six studies with knowledge-related outcomes concerning cardiovascular risk factors or the harmful effects of smoking, three, Stanford Three-City (<LINK REF="STD-Maccoby-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Maccoby 1977</LINK>), CORIS (<LINK REF="STD-Roussow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roussow 1993</LINK>), and Stanford Five-City (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1993</LINK>), of the four studies which assessed gains in knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors showed significant net intervention effects. The fourth study (North Karelia, <LINK REF="STD-Puska-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Puska 1985</LINK>) showed a slight effect. No net intervention effects were seen in the two studies which assessed knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking.</P>
<P>Attitudinal outcomes: Among the seven studies which assessed attitudes to quitting smoking, only one (Alliance of Black Churches, <LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>) showed a net intervention effect: a significant progression through the stages of change. One other study (COMMIT, <LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>) showed net intervention effects for heavy smokers in the independent surveys, and for light-to-moderate smokers in the cohort follow up, concerning smoking as a public health problem.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Enabling factors </I>
</B>
<BR/>Quit attempts: Among the nine studies which assessed quit attempts, only one (North Karelia, <LINK REF="STD-Puska-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Puska 1985</LINK>) showed a significant net intervention effect.</P>
<P>Smoking environment: Of the two studies with pre- and post-intervention measures related to the smoking environment, one assessed household and friends smoking, and the other passive smoking. Neither showed a significant net intervention effect.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Reinforcing factors</I>
</B>
<BR/>Social influences or support for quitting: Neither of the two studies which had pre- and post-intervention assessments of social pressures to quit showed a net intervention effect. In the only study with a pre- and post-intervention assessment of social support for quitting smoking, there was no net intervention effect. The study of general emotional support and social networks showed no apparent intervention effect for either variable, but significance was not tested.</P>
<P>Norms concerning smoking: Of the two studies which assessed intervention effects on norms concerning smoking, one (<LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>) showed no net intervention effect, and the other (Breathe Easy, <LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 2000</LINK>) showed a significant net intervention effect for women smokers' perceptions of community norms, but not for their perceptions of family or friends' norms.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Process Evaluation: </B>
<BR/>We note here comparisons between intervention and comparison communities for two aspects of process evaluation: programme exposure or awareness, and dose-response. Programme exposure or awareness was compared between conditions in 11 (30%) studies (four cardiovascular risk reduction and seven smoking reduction). In three cardiovascular risk reduction studies, North Karelia (<LINK REF="STD-Puska-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Puska 1985</LINK>), Schleiz (<LINK REF="STD-Heinemann-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Heinemann 1986</LINK>), and Danish Municipality Project (<LINK REF="STD-Osler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Osler 1993</LINK>), exposure or programme awareness was significantly higher in the intervention communities. In the fourth, the Minnesota Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1995</LINK>), programme exposure was significantly higher in the intervention cities in years one and three, but not in years five and six. In six smoking reduction studies, COMMIT (<LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>), Breathe Easy (<LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 2000</LINK>), Neighbors for a Smoke-free Northside (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>), Vietnamese Men 1 (<LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>) and 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>), and Alliance for Black Churches (<LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>), exposure or programme awareness was also significantly higher in the intervention communities, but not in the other study, the Dutch Community Study (<LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>). Four of these projects, including the Dutch Community Study, had no smoking behavioural effects. Only one study, COMMIT, compared dose-response between conditions. The receipt index used to measure dose was significantly higher in the intervention communities for the cohort of light-to-moderate smokers followed up, and among smokers and ex-smokers in the cross-sectional follow-up survey.</P>
<P>
<B>Economic Evaluation</B>
<BR/>Cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses were reported for six (16%) studies, one of which (Heartbeat Wales, <LINK REF="STD-Tudor_x002d_Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tudor-Smith 1998</LINK>) included both, and another (Norsjo Project, <LINK REF="STD-Weinehall-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weinehall 1999</LINK>) also included a 'willingness to pay' analysis. All six reported favourable cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit ratios, indicating that these studies were economically attractive. Only one of these (Breathe Easy, <LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 2000</LINK>) focused solely on smoking, while the other five were cardiovascular risk reduction projects. Two projects, the Stanford Five-city Project (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1993</LINK>) and the Pawtucket Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Carleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carleton 1995</LINK>), reported on the cost-effectiveness of their smoking cessation interventions. Programme costs, or per capita costs, were reported for five (14%) studies. No mention of costs was found in the other 24 (65%) studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Findings of individual studies</B>
<BR/>These descriptions highlight the major features and smoking-related outcomes of each study and are presented in the order in which they were undertaken, starting with the North Karelia project. More details about each project can be found in the Characteristics of Included Studies table and in the Results of Included Studies table. In these tables, each study is identified by the name of the first author and year of publication of the article describing the main results, and the studies are presented in alphabetical order of this first author. The Included Studies reference list is in the same alphabetical order as the tables, with the lead article indicated by an asterisk, and articles pertaining to that study in alphabetical order of their first author. In the descriptions which follow, we indicate the lead author and year of publication of the main results for each study in parentheses.</P>
<P>The North Karelia Project (<LINK REF="STD-Puska-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Puska 1985</LINK>) was initiated in Finland in 1972 to decrease mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease through a comprehensive community-based programme to reduce the major cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, high serum cholesterol and high blood pressure. In a quasi-experimental design, the investigators compared cardiovascular risk factor changes in North Karelia with those in the adjacent county of Kuopio. After five years, compared with Kuopio, there was a lower prevalence of smoking among women in North Karelia, but not among men. In contrast, per capita cigarette consumption was lower among men, but not among women. After 10 years, per capita cigarette consumption in North Karelia was lower among men, but not among women. Follow up has continued for 25 years.</P>
<P>The Stanford Three-city Project (<LINK REF="STD-Maccoby-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Maccoby 1977</LINK>) was started in the United States in 1972 to reduce the cardiovascular risk factors of smoking, high cholesterol and high blood pressure through the use of mass media and community programmes. Weight and physical activity were also targeted. In a quasi-experimental design one town, Watsonville, was exposed to both mass media and community programmes, while another town, Gilroy, was exposed to the mass media component alone, and the third town, Tracy, received no intervention and was the comparison community. After two years, compared with Tracy, the non-intervention town, there was a lower per capita cigarette consumption among both men and women in Watsonville, which received the mass media campaign and the community intervention, with an even lower level among the intensive intervention group. An intermediate reduction in per capita cigarette consumption was observed in Gilroy, the town exposed to the mass media campaign alone.</P>
<P>The Schleiz Study (<LINK REF="STD-Heinemann-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Heinemann 1986</LINK>) was initiated in the Democratic Republic of Germany in 1973, and was designed to reduce the cardiovascular risk factors of smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and sedentary lifestyle. The quasi-experimental design compared cardiovascular risk factor changes in the district of Schleiz with those in the district of Dippoldiswalde. After five years, there was a 7% lower prevalence of smoking in the district of Schleiz compared with the district of Dippoldiswalde.</P>
<P>The Eberbach-Wiesloch Study (<LINK REF="STD-Nussel-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nussel 1985</LINK>) was initiated in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1976, to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through reductions in smoking, serum cholesterol and high blood pressure. The quasi-experimental design compared cardiovascular risk factor changes in Eberbach with those in Wiesloch. After four years, components of the intervention were introduced in Wiesloch, and further comparisons of risk factor changes in Eberbach were made with the town of Neckargemund. From shortly before the intervention was introduced in Weisloch to four year follow up, the prevalence of smoking in the cohort of women being followed increased to a similar extent in Eberbach and Wiesloch (9.0% and 12.0% respectively). Among the cohort of men being followed, the prevalence of smoking decreased 14.0% in Eberbach, but increased 4.0% in Weisloch. Four years later, in 1988, the prevalence of smoking in the cohort of women in Eberbach had decreased 13.0%, while it increased 11.0% in Neckargemund. Among the cohort of men, the prevalence of smoking increased 5.0% in Eberbach, but decreased by 7.0% in Neckargemund.</P>
<P>The National Research Programme in Switzerland (<LINK REF="STD-Gutzwiller-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gutzwiller 1985</LINK>) was initiated in 1977 to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through reductions in smoking, cholesterol, high blood pressure and sedentary lifestyles. The community-based intervention took place in two cities, Aarau and Nyon. Two similar cities, Solothurn and Vevey, served for comparison. After three years of intervention activity, there was a reduction in the prevalence of smoking among both men and women, an increase in the quit rate and a reduction in the initiation rate of smoking in Aarau and Nyon compared with Solothurn and Vevey. Low response rates to both the baseline and follow-up screenings temper these results.</P>
<P>The North Coast Quit for Life Programme (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1983</LINK>) took place in three small towns in New South Wales, Australia. It began in 1978, and was part of a cardiovascular risk reduction programme 'The North Coast Healthy Lifestyle Programme'. The main aim of North Coast Quit for Life Programme was to reduce the prevalence of smoking. In a quasi-experimental design the effects of a mass media programme alone in one community, Coffs Harbour, were compared with the same mass media programme combined with a community programme in another community, Lismore. A third community, Tamworth, was the reference area. After two years of intervention, compared with Tamworth, there was a reduction in the prevalence of smoking among both women and men in Coffs Harbour and Lismore, and the reduction was better sustained in Lismore, the town exposed to both the mass media and community interventions.</P>
<P>The Coronary Risk Factor Study (CORIS) (<LINK REF="STD-Roussow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roussow 1993</LINK>), which started in 1979, took place in South Africa, modelled on the Stanford Three-City Project. The goal was to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, stress, sedentary life style and smoking. One town, Robertson, received a mass media intervention and a community-based intervention; a second town, Swellenden, received the mass media intervention alone, and a third town, Riversdale, was the comparison community. Cross-sectional surveys were done at baseline, and then follow-up surveys at the end of the planned intervention and again eight years later. A cohort, identified at baseline, was followed up at the end of the intervention. At the end of the four-year intervention, smoking prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption were reduced to a similar extent in Robertson and Swellenden. At this four-year follow-up, the quit rates among women in both intervention communities were greater than in Riversdale. At the long-term follow-up, conducted 12 years after the interventions began, smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption were still lower in Swellenden, the low intensity intervention community, but not in Robertson, the high intensity intervention town, where they were comparable to Riversdale, the comparison community.</P>
<P>The Stanford Five-City Project (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1993</LINK>) took place in the United States, starting in 1980. It was designed to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity through a comprehensive community and mass media intervention to reduce smoking, high serum cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary lifestyles and weight. In a quasi-experimental design, two cities, Monterey and Salinas, received the interventions, while two others, Modesto and San Luis Obispo, were the comparison cities, and a fifth city, Santa Maria, was used to monitor cardiovascular mortality and morbidity data. There were baseline measurements for two years before the intervention began, at alternate year intervals during the intervention and again two years after the intervention was completed. Cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses were undertaken. In the cross-sectional follow-up analyses, smoking prevalence fell to a comparable extent in both the intervention and comparison cities. The cohort follow-up analyses showed a greater rate of decline in smoking prevalence in the two intervention cities compared with the two comparison cities. Both cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses showed greater quit rates in the two intervention cities compared with the two comparison cities.</P>
<P>The Minnesota Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1995</LINK>) also started in 1980 and was designed to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity through a comprehensive community intervention to reduce smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and sedentary lifestyles. The project ran in three pairs of cities in the mid-western United States, Mankato and Winona, Fargo-Morehead and Sioux Falls, and Bloomington and Roseville, with the first city of each pair receiving the educational interventions and the other city acting as a comparison community. There were baseline measurements for four years before the interventions began, annually during the intervention and again two years after the planned withdrawal of project support for the community programmes. Cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses were undertaken. For men, although the prevalence of smoking fell, neither the cross-sectional follow-up analyses nor the cohort follow-up analyses showed any intervention effect. For women, a significant intervention effect was seen in the cross-sectional follow-up analyses, with a steady decline in smoking prevalence compared with the comparison communities, but no effect was detected in the cohort follow-up analyses.</P>
<P>The Pawtucket Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Carleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carleton 1995</LINK>) took place in the United States, starting in 1982, targeting cardiovascular mortality and morbidity through a comprehensive community intervention to reduce smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and physical inactivity. Using a quasi-experimental design, the intervention community in Pawtucket was compared with an anonymous control community. Baseline assessments, assessments during the intervention and two years after their completion were undertaken. Both cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses were done. The prevalence of smoking fell in both Pawtucket and the reference community, with no significant difference between the two.</P>
<P>The Tessin Cantonal Prevention Programme (<LINK REF="STD-Domenighetti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Domenighetti 1991</LINK>) started in 1982 in Switzerland. The programme's goal was to prevent cardiovascular disease. It used a quasi-experimental design, with the Canton of Tessin receiving the community interventions and two other Cantons, Vaud and Fribourg, acting as comparison communities. The outcome was assessed through MONICA (Monitoring of trends and determinants in Cardiovascular Disease Project) surveys. In the Canton of Tessin, a reduction in smoking prevalence was seen among men but not women, and the proportion of ex-smokers increased, both at the population level and among men, but not among women. No changes in any of these measures of smoking behaviour were seen in the Cantons of Vaud and Fribourg.</P>
<P>Sezze District Community Project (<LINK REF="STD-Giampaoli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giampaoli 1997</LINK>) took place in Italy, starting in 1982. The aim was to prevent cardiovascular disease. In a quasi-experimental design, the Sezze Health District, which included the municipalities of Sezze, Roccagorga and Bassiano, was assigned to receive the intervention, and the municipality of Priverno was selected as the comparison community. After 10 years, reductions in the prevalence of smoking were seen among men in both intervention and comparison districts, but there was no difference between the districts. Among women, the prevalence of smoking decreased in the Sezze Health District, but increased in the municipality of Priverno.</P>
<P>The German Cardiovascular Prevention Study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmeister-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmeister 1996</LINK>) started in West Germany in 1984. The main goal was to reduce the four cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and obesity through primary prevention. A quasi-experimental design was used with six communities, the city districts in Berlin, Bremen, Stuttgart, the city of Karlsruhe, two small neighbouring communities, Bruchsal and Mosbach, and the rural district of Traunstein, assigned to receive the intervention, while comparison was made with randomly selected samples drawn from the rest of West Germany. After seven years of programme activities, there was an overall decline in the prevalence of smoking in the intervention communities compared with the nationwide trend. The reduction in prevalence was seen among men, but not among women.</P>
<P>The Vasterotten Intervention Programme in Norsjo municipality (<LINK REF="STD-Weinehall-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weinehall 1999</LINK>), which took place in Sweden, began in 1985, and aimed to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Smoking, diet, high blood pressure and weight were targeted. In a quasi-experimental design the rural municipality of Norsjo was assigned to receive the intervention. Comparison of risk factors was made with the population in MONICA Northern Sweden. After six years of intervention activity, the prevalence of smoking increased slightly among both women and men in Norsjo, but was unchanged among the comparison samples of women and men. In cohorts of women and men followed in Norsjo, the prevalence of smoking fell 3.7 % among the women and 2.7 % among the men.</P>
<P>The Texas-Mexican Border Study (<LINK REF="STD-McAlister-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 1992</LINK>) took place in two cities in Texas U.S.A., Eagle Pass and Del Rio, and in one in Mexico, Piedras Negras. The project began in 1985 with the aims of promoting good health by reducing smoking, alcohol use, and weight, and increasing seat-belt use and participation in annual check-ups. A quasi-experimental design was used, with Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras assigned to receive the intervention, and Del Rio to act as the comparison community. After 4.3 years, the quit rate among the cohort followed in Eagle Pass was greater than that in Del Rio. No additional benefit was found associated with the higher intensity intervention. The self-reported quit rate in Piedras Negras was similar to that in Eagle Pass.</P>
<P>Heartbeat Wales (<LINK REF="STD-Tudor_x002d_Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tudor-Smith 1998</LINK>) started in 1985 as a demonstration project to reduce cardiovascular disease and mortality through health education and policy changes designed to modify smoking, diet, physical activity and weight. A quasi-experimental design was used, with Wales as the intervention area, and four counties in North East England serving as the comparison area. After five years, no intervention effect was detected, the prevalence of smoking having decreased significantly and to a similar extent in both Wales and the comparison counties in England. Detailed process data showed rapid diffusion of many of the intervention activities to the reference areas and to other parts of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Heart to Heart project, (<LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1995</LINK>), a five-year community intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, took place in South Carolina, U.S.A., starting in 1986. A quasi-experimental design was used, with one city, Florence, designated the intervention community, and another, Anderson, the comparison community. After five years, the prevalence of smoking had declined in both communities, but there was no difference between them. However, among men there was a significant decline in Florence compared with Anderson, but not among women. The authors describe in detail the difficulties associated with building an effective coalition to run this project.</P>
<P>The Anti-Tobacco Education Project (<LINK REF="STD-Anantha-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Anantha 1995</LINK>) took place in India and aimed to reduce tobacco consumption. The project began in 1986 and used a quasi-experimental design with villages in the purview of three Primary Health Centres: Dibbur with 177 villages was assigned to receive the intervention, and two other areas, Malur with 136 villages and Gudibanda with 120 villages, were the comparison communities. Evaluation was by personal interview, and both cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses were done. After six years of this health education initiative, reductions in the prevalence of tobacco use were seen among both women and men in the villages in the intervention district compared with those in each of the comparison districts, for both cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses. Tobacco use quit rates among women and men were also greater in the intervention district than in each of the comparison districts, and tobacco use initiation rates were lower.</P>
<P>The Kilkenny Project (<LINK REF="STD-Shelley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 1995</LINK>) took place in County Kilkenny, Ireland, and started in 1987. The major aim was the reduction of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, namely smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and sedentary lifestyle. A quasi-experimental design was used, with Kilkenny County chosen as the intervention community because the local Health Board was willing to collaborate with the programme. The comparison county was County Offaly. After five years, there was no difference in the prevalence of cigarette smoking between County Kilkenny and County Offaly, prevalence having fallen among both women and men in each county.</P>
<P>The Batsfjord Finnmark Intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lupton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lupton 2003</LINK>) started in 1987, and was designed to change cardiovascular risk factors. The intervention aimed to reduce smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and weight, and to increase physical activity. Further aims included reducing coffee and alcohol consumption, and promoting health and well-being. The intervention was implemented in the coastal community of Batsfjord, in Norway, with three smaller communities, Loppa, Gamvik and Masoy, assigned to the comparison condition. Evaluation was through baseline assessment of a cohort of adults, ages 20-62, in the intervention and comparison communities in 1987, with a follow-up assessment in 1993, after six years. Each assessment included three mailed questionnaires, then screening with a physical exam, and blood tests. At the six-year follow up, there was no significant effect on smoking prevalence among either women or men.</P>
<P>The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation, COMMIT (<LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>) took place in 11 pairs of communities, 10 pairs in the United States and one pair in Canada, starting in 1988. The trial was designed to reduce the prevalence of smoking among heavy smokers, i.e. men and women smoking 25 or more cigarettes per day. It used a randomized controlled design, one of each matched pair of communities being randomly assigned to receive the intervention, and the other acting as the comparison community. After five years of intervention activity, cross-sectional follow-up analyses showed falls in the prevalence of smoking in the intervention and comparison communities, but no significant difference between them. The cohort follow-up study showed no significant difference between intervention and comparison communities in the quit rates among heavy smokers, but among light and moderate smokers (those smoking less than 25 cigarettes per day) the quit rate was significantly greater in the intervention communities. Estimates of the population quit rates for the intervention and comparison communities, calculated from the data for heavy smokers and from light/moderate smokers, showed a significantly greater quit rate in the intervention communities.</P>
<P>The North Cape Finnmark Intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lupton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lupton 2002</LINK>) was started in 1988, and was designed to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and accidents at work, as well as improve working conditions among the workers in the fishing industry. The intervention, planned to last 10 years, aimed to reduce smoking, cholesterol, and blood pressure, and increase physical activity. Further aims included reducing work-related accidents and sick leave, coffee and alcohol consumption, and myocardial infarction risk score. The intervention was implemented in the coastal community of North Cape, in Norway, with three smaller coastal communities, Loppa, Gamvik and Masoy, assigned to the comparison condition. (These communities were also the comparison group for <LINK REF="STD-Lupton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lupton 2003</LINK>). Evaluation was through baseline assessment of cohorts ages 40-62 years and 15% of 20-39 year-olds, in the intervention and comparison communities, with follow-up assessments after two and six years. Each assessment included a personal interview, physical exam, and blood tests. At the six-year follow up, there was a significant reduction in smoking prevalence among women, but not among men. Despite this positive result it seems more likely that the reduction in women's smoking was a secular one, rather than a result of the intervention. The intervention was largely directed to fishermen and the men in the fishing industry, with little emphasis on smoking, and no additional smoking cessation resources were made available, except from health professionals. Furthermore, the prevalence of smoking among women in North Cape, prior to the intervention, 53.4%, was substantially higher than that among women in the three comparison municipalities, 47.5%, and women in Batsfjord, 46.6%, the site of the other Finnmark intervention. During the five-year intervention the prevalence of smoking among women in North Cape fell to 47.5%, a level comparable to that among women in the comparison municipalities, 46.8%, and among women in Batsfjord, 45.4%.</P>
<P>The Dutch Study to reduce the prevalence of smoking took place in two communities in Holland (<LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>), and began in 1989. The intervention community, Den Bosch, was randomly selected from a demographically matched pair of cities. The other city, Apeldorn, became the comparison community. A national anti-smoking media programme was launched unexpectedly during the intervention, contaminating the experiment. After 14 months, no effect was shown in either smoking prevalence or quit rates in Den Bosch compared with Apeldorn.</P>
<P>The Community Coalitions to Help Women Quit Smoking Project (Breathe Easy), (<LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 2000</LINK>) took place in four counties in the north-eastern United States beginning in 1989. The aim was to reduce the prevalence of smoking among women. A quasi-experimental design was used, with two adjacent counties, Windham County, Vermont, and Cheshire County, New Hampshire designated the intervention counties, and Rutland County, Vermont, and Belknap County, New Hampshire, the comparison counties. After five years, cross-sectional follow-up analyses showed a significantly lower prevalence of smoking among women in the intervention counties (Windham and Cheshire). There was also a significantly greater quit rate, particularly among younger women and women with lower incomes, and also among heavy smokers in these counties, compared with Rutland and Belknap counties.</P>
<P>The Danish Municipality Project (<LINK REF="STD-Osler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Osler 1993</LINK>) took place in the municipalities of Slangerup and Helsinge in Denmark, and started in 1989. The project aimed to improve several behaviours related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, little or no exercise, and high fat consumption. A quasi-experimental design was used, with the municipality of Slangerup assigned to receive the intervention and the municipality of Helsinge to serve as the comparison community. After one year, no differences were found in the prevalence of smoking, number of quit attempts or quit rates in Slangerup compared with Helsinge.</P>
<P>The Otsego-Schoharie Healthy Heart Program (<LINK REF="STD-Nafziger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nafziger 2001</LINK>), took place among a rural population in New York state, in the United States, between 1989 and 1995. The cardiovascular risk reduction intervention took place in Otsego and Schoharie counties, with Herkimer county as the comparison county. The health education intervention aimed to reduce smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and weight, and to increase physical activity. In addition, a school-based cardiovascular risk reduction curriculum was also developed and implemented. Evaluation at baseline was through a cross-sectional survey of adults, aged 20-69 years, selected through random digit telephone dialling. The telephone interviews were followed by a clinical evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors. A second cross-sectional survey, using the same methodology was undertaken five years later. In addition, a panel of baseline respondents was followed up at this time. Cigarette smoking was assessed by questionnaire and also by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). After five years of intervention, there was a significant reduction in smoking among adult women and men, in both the cross-sectional and panel studies, whether measured by self-report, CO levels greater than 8 parts per million, or actual exhaled CO levels.</P>
<P>The Action Heart Project (<LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>), which took place in England beginning in 1990, aimed to modify the following cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, diet, high blood pressure and physical activity. A quasi-experimental design was used, with two adjacent communities, Swinton and Wath, assigned to receive the intervention and another community, Maltby, selected as the comparison community. After four years of intervention activity, there was a decrease in the prevalence of smoking in Swinton and Wath and a slight increase in Maltby.</P>
<P>The Neighbors Smoke-Free North Side (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>) took place in St. Louis and Kansas City in the United States beginning in 1990. The aim was to reduce the prevalence of smoking, with particular emphasis on African Americans. A quasi-experimental design was used with three neighbourhoods in St. Louis assigned to receive the intervention programme. Four demographically similar zip code areas in Kansas City served as comparison. Evaluation was by random digit dialling telephone interviews of independent samples at baseline and two years later. There was a reduction in the prevalence of smoking among all respondents in the St. Louis neighbourhoods compared with those in the zip code areas in Kansas City. This reduction was seen among whites, women aged 35 years or less, and those with incomes of US$20,000 or more, but not among African Americans or men.</P>
<P>The Vietnamese-American Men Projects took place in the United States starting in 1990. Both projects focused on changing the smoking behaviour of Vietnamese-American men, both used quasi-experimental designs, similar interventions and the same comparison community. One project targeted Vietnamese-American men living in San Francisco and Alameda counties in California (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>), and the other, Vietnamese-American men living in Santa Clara County, California (<LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>). The comparison community for both projects was Vietnamese-American men living in Houston, Texas. At the completion of the intervention, the odds of being a smoker were lower, and the odds of being a quitter in the previous two years were higher in San Francisco and Alameda counties than in Houston (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>). In Santa Clara County, after 24 months of intervention activities, the prevalence of smoking remained unchanged, and was also unchanged in Houston (<LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Bootheel Project (<LINK REF="STD-Brownson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brownson 1996</LINK>), which aimed to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors including smoking, took place in six counties in southern Missouri, in the United States, and began in 1990. A quasi-experimental design was used, with the six counties selected to take part in the intervention because of their high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. There was no comparison community, but data from the six counties were compared with the Missouri Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System data for rural counties, at baseline and for the final survey. After four years, smoking prevalence had fallen in the six counties and in the rest of rural Missouri, but there was no difference between them.</P>
<P>The Healthy Bergeyk Project (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Assema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Assema 1994</LINK>) took place in Holland and started in 1990. The main aim of the project was to reduce the prevalence of cancer-related risk behaviours, especially smoking and high fat consumption. The municipality of Bergeyk was randomly selected from six potential municipalities to be the intervention community and the comparison municipality selected from three of the others located in a separate media market from Bergeyk. After 18 months of intervention programme activities, the prevalence of smoking fell 3.3 % among the cohort followed in Bergeyk compared with 0.4 % in the comparison community, but the difference in prevalence was not significant.</P>
<P>The Alliance of Black Churches Project (<LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>) took place in the state of Virginia, in the United States, beginning in 1991, and aimed to increase the smoking cessation rate among rural African Americans. The project used a quasi-experimental design, with Buckingham County assigned to receive the intervention, and Louisa County to act as the comparison county. After 18 months, the quit rate during that time was 9.6% in Buckingham County and 5.6% in Louisa County, a non-significant difference.</P>
<P>The Epernon Study (<LINK REF="STD-Bruckert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruckert 1999</LINK>) took place in the town of Epernon, France, from 1991 to 1996 and aimed to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Two similar towns, Moret sur Loing and Magny en Vixin, were the comparison communities. The health education intervention was designed to reduce smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and weight, and to increase physical activity. The evaluation used a cohort design. Randomly selected participants, 20-65 years of age, completed an interview, and had their blood pressure, height and weight measured, and blood tests done at baseline, and again after five years. There was no significant effect on smoking prevalence, quit rates, or initiation rates.</P>
<P>The 'Coeur en Sant St-Henri' Project (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Loughlin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Loughlin 1999</LINK>) took place in two disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods, St-Henri and Centre-Sud, in Montreal, Canada. The major aim of the project, which started in 1992, was to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, smoking, high-fat diet, high blood pressure, lack of physical activity, and weight. It was targeted towards women. A quasi-experimental design was used, with the neighbourhood of St-Henri being designated the intervention community. Cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses were done. After four years, no differences in smoking prevalence were found between St-Henri and Centre-Sud. Process analyses indicated that although awareness of the programme reached 37.4%, participation rates were low, about 2 to 3%.</P>
<P>The Cancer Action in Rural Towns Project (CART) (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>), which started in 1992, took place in 10 pairs of rural towns in New South Wales, Australia. The primary aim of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of a community action programme in increasing community rates of preventive and screening behaviours relating to breast, cervical, smoking-related and skin cancer in rural Australian towns. A randomized design was used with 10 pairs of towns matched on demographic, infrastructure and geographic variables. One town from each pair was randomly allocated to either the experimental or the comparison condition. A cohort follow-up analysis was undertaken, which included both smokers and non-smokers. After 3 to 3 years of intervention activity, there was a significantly greater quit rate among men in the intervention towns compared with the comparison towns, but not among women. Smoking initiation rates did not differ significantly for women or men.</P>
<P>The Dutch Heart Health Community Intervention, 'Hartslag Limburg' (<LINK REF="STD-Ronda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ronda 2004</LINK>), started in 1998, and was designed to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The intervention, which aimed to reduce smoking and cholesterol and increase physical activity, took place in the Dutch province of Limburg, with an unnamed province as the comparison area. The PRECEDE/PROCEED model was used to plan and evaluate the intervention, which used the theories of self-efficacy, planned behaviour change and stages of change as guiding principles. Evaluation was by telephone interview of a cohort of adult smokers identified in 1998, and followed up on two occasions, in 2000 and 2001. There was a substantial decrease in number of smokers, almost 29% quitting smoking between 1998 and 2001, but no significant difference between Maastricht and the comparison region. A national mass media-led smoking cessation campaign was implemented in the Netherlands during the time of the intervention, and probably contributed to the decrease in smokers in both regions.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary of smoking behavioural outcomes</B>
<BR/>For this summary, we define a favourable outcome as a significant difference in smoking behaviour, either lower prevalence, lower per capita cigarette consumption, or greater quit rate, for either women or men or both, in the intervention condition compared with the comparison condition, as reported by the investigators. Overall, in 23 studies (62%) the investigators reported at least one favourable outcome in smoking behaviour, whilst there was no significant difference in 14 (38%) (<LINK REF="STD-Brownson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brownson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruckert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bruckert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carleton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lupton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lupton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Loughlin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Loughlin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Osler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ronda 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tudor_x002d_Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tudor-Smith 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Assema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Assema 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinehall-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weinehall 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In six studies the community was both the unit of assignment and the unit of analysis, and two others used appropriate methods to allow for clustering. Among these eight studies, at least one significant smoking behavioural intervention effect was reported in five (62.5%), and none in three (37.5%), whereas in the remaining 29 studies, in which the individual was the unit of analysis, and hence the significance levels deflated, at least one favourable intervention effect was reported in 18 (62%), and none in 11 (38%).</P>
<P>
<B>Two studies with treated comparison communities</B>
<BR/>We comment here on two other community projects. These did not meet inclusion criteria because each compared a more intense community-based intervention with a less intense one, neither using an untreated comparison community.</P>
<P>The Heart, Body and Soul Project (<LINK REF="STD-Stillman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stillman 1993</LINK>) took place in East Baltimore, Maryland, United States, and began in the1990s. The study used an experimental design with 22 churches randomly assigned to receive either an intensive culturally-specific smoking cessation intervention for African Americans or a minimal self-help smoking cessation intervention. Both interventions included community organization, community staff members and planning groups, and an initial health fair at which smokers were recruited to participate in the interventions, and given feedback on their exhaled carbon monoxide levels. The intensive intervention included sermons on smoking, testimony from individuals in the process of quitting, training volunteers as lay smoking cessation counsellors, and individual and group support supplemented with spiritual audiotapes containing gospel music, and a scripturally guided stop smoking booklet. The minimal intervention consisted of the provision of the American Lung Association's pamphlet 'Don't let your dreams go up in smoke', designed for African Americans, given to smokers at the initial health fair. After one year of intervention activities, the self-reported quit rate among the cohort of smokers participating in the intensive intervention (n=199) was 27.1% (biochemically validated 19.6%), and among the cohort of smokers participating in the minimal intervention (n=93), 21.5% (biochemically validated 15.1%). Neither the self-reported quit rates, nor the validated quit rates differed significantly. Both these quit rates differed significantly from the spontaneous quit rate reported by churchgoers in the community reference population (2.9%). This reference population had a markedly different prevalence of smoking (35.5%) from the churchgoers identified at the health fairs (22%).<BR/>
<BR/>The Four Cities Project (<LINK REF="STD-Darity-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Darity 1997</LINK>), which started in 1988, took place in four cities in the United States: Hartford, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; Durham, North Carolina; and Columbia, South Carolina, and used a quasi-experimental design. Two middle-income and two lower-income areas of predominantly African American populations were identified in each city, and one of each pair assigned to either a passive intervention or the same passive intervention plus an active intervention. The passive intervention consisted of mass media, including radio public service announcements supplemented by paid advertisements about the health and social advantages of not smoking using local role models; television public service announcements and an occasional spot produced by the project; local and indigenous newspapers with news releases, letters, guest columns and special features; feature articles in a local magazine, and a logo. The active intervention included community organization, formation of advisory councils, health and smoking committees, site co-ordinators, health educators and involvement of churches, fraternal organizations and neighbourhood associations. In addition there were household surveys, with feedback on carbon monoxide levels, educational materials (fact sheet, self-help kit, resource list), newsletters, a telephone hotline staffed by a health educator, neighbourhood representatives, trained to respond to residents' requests for information, and to make referrals, quit nights, National Smokeout Week events, ex-smokers' clubs and a smoke-free community campaign. Although the interventions were planned to last three years, final results were presented after 18 months of intervention activity. Follow up of a cohort of smokers identified at the initial household surveys was done by telephone (n=1344). The non-smoking rate among the active intervention areas was 16.7%, versus 11.8% in the passive intervention areas, a difference of 4.9%. Three other smoking behavioural outcomes were reported: at least one quit attempt in the prior six months (active intervention 33.8% versus 26.2%, a difference of 7.6%), smoke-free days in past six months (active intervention 28.1 days versus 19.4 days, difference 8.7 days), and reduction in cigarettes per day among smokers (active intervention 2.0 cigarettes versus 0.4 cigarettes, difference 1.6 cigarettes). All these differences were statistically significant at the P &lt; 0.05 level.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The marked heterogeneity of these studies precludes any formal statistical comparisons or meta-analyses. Some of this heterogeneity relates to the different approaches used for these community interventions, but some of it also relates to the method of reporting. Thus, our comments are, for the most part, of a qualitative nature. We note aspects of the design and analyses that compromise the validity of conclusions from these studies. We also discuss the relationship of individual components of the interventions to smoking-related outcomes, but are unable to suggest which, alone or in combination, are more effective than others.</P>
<P>
<I>Design issues:</I> The non-random assignment of the intervention and comparison groups in almost all these studies, even when attempts were made to select communities matched on demographic criteria, required analyses which adjusted for baseline differences. For several studies only a few variables, such as age and gender, were used for these adjustments. Other differences not measured could have confounded the results. </P>
<P>Two studies stand out in terms of validity through their randomized design and adequate power. COMMIT, which also had comparable baseline characteristics among intervention and comparison communities, found no intervention effect for the changes in smoking prevalence in the cross-sectional follow up, or independent samples. The significant increase in the quit rate seen among the cohort of light-to-moderate smokers followed up, and also in the weighted estimate of the quit rate among all smokers (derived from the data for light-to-moderate and heavy smokers), indicates some success for the COMMIT interventions among individuals, but not at the community level, where no intervention effect was found for the prevalence of smoking. The CART study (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>) showed a significantly greater quit rate among men, but not among women, also indicating some success at the individual level, but community level changes in prevalence were not found. </P>
<P>
<I>Unit of analysis:</I> Perhaps of greater importance was the frequent use of the individual as the unit of analysis, when the unit of assignment was the community. We have described these studies, but note that their reported significance levels, shown in the Comparisons and Data Table, are likely to be misleading, because without adjustment for the intraclass correlations within communities the P-values are artificially deflated. Several studies examined the intraclass correlations within communities, and finding them small and often insignificant, ignored them to conserve power. But, as Murray and others have pointed out, the unit of analysis must match the design if valid conclusions are to be drawn (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1998</LINK>). Studies of only two communities are particularly difficult to interpret as no statistical assessment is possible if these are analysed at the cluster level.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size and power calculations: </I>For most of these studies, no power calculations were reported, making it somewhat difficult to interpret negative findings. However, with the additional problem that these studies used the individual as the unit of analysis, it is unlikely that these results are falsely negative.</P>
<P>
<I>Secular trends in smoking prevalence:</I> Another important confounding circumstance is the secular trend in smoking prevalence, both prior to the interventions, and especially during them. In all but three studies (Stanford Five-City Project, Minnesota Heart Health Program, and Pawtuckett Heart Health Program), no measures of prior secular trends were included. It is interesting to note that it is likely that secular trends obscured the effects of the COMMIT programme (<LINK REF="REF-Bauman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauman 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<I>Risk factors addressed:</I> The number of risk factors addressed as part of an intervention may influence smoking behavioural outcomes. Projects which addressed smoking alone (6/9, 67%) were a little more effective than those which addressed smoking as part of cardiovascular risk reduction or cancer risk reduction (16/28, 57%).</P>
<P>
<I>Site of project:</I> A larger proportion of the15 projects undertaken in North America, 10/15 (67%) reported at least one favourable smoking behavioural outcome, compared with 9/18 (50%) of those undertaken in Europe. All four undertaken elsewhere, two in Australia (1978 and 2001), and one each in South Africa (1979) and India (1986) reported at least one favourable outcome. The setting of the interventions, whether in towns or cities, or counties, or health districts, had no clear effect on smoking behavioural outcomes, nor did an urban setting compared with a rural one.</P>
<P>
<I>Length of intervention:</I> The four projects which lasted less than two years had no demonstrable effect, but among those lasting two to five years or more than five years, the proportion of studies reporting at least one favourable outcome was greater in the studies lasting more than five years, (16/24 (67%) versus 7/9 (78%) respectively).</P>
<P>
<I>Theoretical basis for interventions: </I>There was no clear influence of any of the theoretical models on the outcomes of these interventions, either individually or in combination. </P>
<P>
<I>Involvement of community members: </I>The use of community organization, community staff members, coalitions of planning groups, or task forces was not clearly related to the smoking behavioural outcomes. </P>
<P>
<I>Channels for intervention delivery: </I>We examined the use of each of the different channels for intervention delivery with the outcomes of each study. Intervention delivery through volunteers, or health professionals or educators, did not appear to be related to a favourable outcome. Nor were the different types of organization involved in the delivery of the interventions, such as worksites, churches, schools, community agencies, local health departments, hospitals or local government, related to success. Neither the use of mass media in general, nor newsprint, radio or television individually, were clearly related to smoking behavioural outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>Smoking-specific interventions: </I>The use of smoking-specific interventions, such as quit lines, quit contests, self-help kits, videotapes, slides or film, group cessation classes or individual counselling also did not appear to be related to outcome; nor did advocacy for restricting smoking in public buildings, worksites or schools. </P>
<P>
<B>Mediating variables and intermediate outcomes</B>
<BR/>We note the remarkable paucity of data concerning these mediating variables, with published results related to intervention effects for one or more intermediate outcomes in 17 studies. For specific mediating variables, assessment of intervention effects were found in less than a third of the studies. Furthermore, there was substantial variability in the measures used for conceptually similar mediating variables, so that any comparisons are difficult and fraught with uncertainty. </P>
<P>Among the 17 studies with results available for at least one intermediate outcome, nine (53%) used data from cross-sectional follow-up surveys, four (24%) used data from cohort follow-up surveys, and four (24%) used data from both types of follow-up survey. In these latter four studies, the results from the cross-sectional follow-up and cohort follow-up analyses were generally similar. Eleven of these 17 studies (65%) had at least one positive smoking behavioural change outcome, a rate similar to that among all studies in this review, suggesting that the success of an intervention was not a factor in reporting intermediate outcomes. </P>
<P>The small number of observations for any one of these intermediate outcomes, and the variability of the measures used for specific mediating variables preclude any firm conclusions. We note, however, as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, that among the studies reporting intervention effects for knowledge (six), attitudes (eight) or quit attempts (nine), there was no apparent relationship between net intervention effects for these predisposing and enabling factors and smoking behavioural change. In most of these studies similar changes attributable to secular trends were seen in the comparison group. With fewer studies reporting results for social influences (four), norms (two), and smoking environment (two), we can say even less.</P>
<P>We conclude that the intermediate outcome results for the mediating variables reported for these community interventions contribute little to our understanding of why some interventions were more effective than others. This is partly because there were so few net intervention effects for any of these mediating variables, but also because, for the majority of studies, no intermediate outcome data was were available. Nor, for these same reasons, do these observations help focus future intervention activities to address these conceptually important factors mediating smoking behaviour change.</P>
<P>The lack of published results for those community studies in which mediating variables were assessed at baseline but post-intervention outcomes were not found, may reflect publication bias, as it seems likely, based on this review, that many of these also would have had negative results. </P>
<P>
<B>Process evaluation</B>
<BR/>As with our comments on mediating variables and intermediate outcomes, the variability in type and scope of the process measures reported, and the lack of standardization among them, preclude any firm conclusions. We note that in the 10 studies which used formative research and pilot testing of intervention components, six (60%) had at least one favourable smoking behavioural outcome, and in the eight which used ongoing evaluation and feedback during the intervention, five (63%) had at least one favourable smoking behavioural outcome. These favourable outcome percentages are similar to that of all the studies in this review. The fact that several studies, using formative research, pilot testing and ongoing feedback were unsuccessful does not argue against using these methods during intervention development and implementation, but rather points to the need to understand what other factors related to programme delivery might explain their lack of success.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Participation and smoking behavioural outcomes</I>
</B>
<BR/>In 12 (32%) of the studies, there was some measure of the extent of participation in intervention activities, although these were not necessarily concerned with smoking. Among these 12 studies, four of five with programme participation rates of 30% or more (Stanford Five-City Project (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1993</LINK>) 33%, Minnesota Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1995</LINK>) 30%, A Su Salud (<LINK REF="STD-McAlister-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 1992</LINK>) 58%, Heart to Heart 57% (<LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1995</LINK>)), had at least one successful smoking behavioural outcome. The fifth was Pawtucket Heart Health Program (<LINK REF="STD-Carleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carleton 1995</LINK>) 59%, where secular trends in declining smoking prevalence in the comparison community exceeded the fall in Pawtucket. Of the other seven studies, the Alliance of Black Churches Project (<LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>) had a participation rate of 29% for the participation measure 'being spoken to by a church member about smoking', but the participation rate in the comparison county for the same smoking-related activity was 20%, for a difference of 9% and the difference in cessation rates was nonsignificant. The Otsego/Schoharie project (<LINK REF="STD-Nafziger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nafziger 2001</LINK>) had a participation rate of 18% and a successful outcome. The other five studies had lower programme participation rates, about 15% or less, and none of these had a successful smoking behavioural outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Lupton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lupton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Loughlin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Loughlin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Osler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ronda 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the Northcoast Quit for Life study (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1983</LINK>), the number of quit kits, fact sheets and tip packs distributed, and quitline telephone messages provided, suggest that a substantial proportion of smokers took part, although no estimated participation rate was found. In the Vietnamese-American Men-2 (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>) study, the intervention was described as having 'broad penetration', but no details were provided. In <LINK REF="STD-COMMIT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">COMMIT 1995</LINK>, the measure of programme participation, receipt indices, did not allow an estimation of actual participation rates, but differences in the receipt indices between intervention and comparison communities, although significant, were reported as small. Each of these studies had at least one successful smoking behavioural outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Programme awareness and smoking behavioural outcomes</I>
</B>
<BR/>In 12 studies (Tessin Cantonal Prevention programme (<LINK REF="STD-Domenighetti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Domenighetti 1991</LINK>) , Norsjo Project (<LINK REF="STD-Weinehall-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weinehall 1999</LINK>), Kilkenny Project (<LINK REF="STD-Shelley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 1995</LINK>), Dutch Community Study (<LINK REF="STD-Mudde-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mudde 1995</LINK>), Breathe Easy (<LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 2000</LINK>), Danish Municipality Project (<LINK REF="STD-Osler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Osler 1993</LINK>) , Neighbors for a Smoke-free Northside (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>), Vietnamese-American Men-1 (<LINK REF="STD-McPhee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McPhee 1995</LINK>), Bootheel Project (<LINK REF="STD-Brownson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brownson 1996</LINK>), Healthy Bergeyk (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Assema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Assema 1994</LINK>), Alliance of Black Churches (<LINK REF="STD-Schorling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schorling 1997</LINK>), Coeur en Sant St-Henri (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Loughlin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Loughlin 1999</LINK>)) levels of programme awareness in the intervention communities, which ranged from 24% to 93%, were not associated with a favourable smoking behavioural outcome. Only three of these studies (Tessin Project 80%; Breathe Easy 68%; Neighbors for a Smoke-free Northside 59%) had favourable smoking behavioural outcomes. In six of these studies, levels of programme awareness were also assessed in the comparison communities: Dutch Community Study: Intervention (I) 85% Comparison (C) 84%, difference 1%; Breathe Easy: I 68% C 22%, difference 46%; Danish Municipality Project: I 82% C 67%, difference 15%; Neighbors for a Smoke-free Northside: I 59% C 6%, difference 53%; Vietnamese-American Men-1: I 60% C32%, difference 28%; Alliance of Black Churches: I 43% C 40%, difference 3%. The two studies with measured differences in programme awareness of greater than 30% (Breathe Easy and Neighbors for a Smoke-free Northside) had favourable smoking behavioural outcomes.</P>
<P>We suggest, somewhat speculatively, that several observations derived from this review of process evaluations may help our understanding of why some projects were successful, as judged by at least one favourable smoking behavioural outcome, and others were not. We note that significantly higher levels of programme exposure or programme awareness in the intervention communities than in the comparison communities were accompanied by a successful smoking behavioural outcome in eight of the 10 projects from which these data were derived. Participation rates in programme activities of 30% or more tended to be accompanied by a favourable smoking behavioural outcome, whereas no favourable outcomes were seen with participation rates of about 10% or less. Favourable smoking behavioural outcomes were also seen when programme awareness levels of 30% or greater were found in the intervention communities compared with the comparison communities. Although the evidence is even more tenuous, the larger the intervention dose, the greater the smoking behavioural change observed. </P>
<P>We have examined how some of these process measures may explain the lack of success in the 14 studies in this review which did not have a significant net effect on smoking behaviour. Secular trends in smoking in the comparison communities kept pace with or exceeded those in the intervention communities in three studies (Pawtucket, Heartbeat Wales, Kilkenny). In Heartbeat Wales, there was good evidence of diffusion of intervention components to other parts of the United Kingdom, including the comparison areas, while the intervention was in progress. In two studies (Norsjo Project, Bootheel Project), there were very low levels of programme exposure in relation to smoking, because these interventions placed little or no emphasis on smoking reduction. In four of the five studies with low participation rates (Dutch Study, Danish Municipality Project, Health Bergeyk, Alliance of Black Churches Project) intervention implementation time was 18 months or less, allowing insufficient time for people to become involved with intervention activities. In two of these (Dutch Study, Danish Municipality Project), there was also difficulty in engaging local organizations in these projects. The Dutch study was also severely compromised by a national anti-smoking media programme launched during the course of the intervention, which lead to the high level of programme awareness in the comparison community. The fifth project with a low participation rate (Coeur en Sant St-Henri, 2-3%), lasted four years, and used intervention components that were known to be effective. The reasons for such a low participation rate were not clear, as programme awareness was much higher at 37%, but the low participation rate explains the lack of effect. The remaining study with no net effect on smoking behaviour, the Vietnamese-American Men-1 study, had a comparatively low level of programme awareness, and may have had less penetration than the otherwise similar but successful Vietnamese-American Men-2 study (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>). The latter study was preceded by a 15-month pilot anti-smoking media campaign, and also sought to involve students and their families, so that the major media component of that intervention lasted longer and was more intensive at the community level. </P>
<P>Concerning programme sustainability, we note that among the 18 studies with some information about the maintenance of programme activities after completion of the planned intervention, 16 (88%) (11 cardiovascular risk reduction, three smoking reduction and two cancer reduction), continued some programme activity beyond that time. Eleven (73%) of these 15 had at least one favourable smoking behavioural outcome. Of the two studies that were unable to maintain their interventions, one (smoking reduction) had a favourable smoking behavioural outcome and the other (cardiovascular risk reduction) did not. However, all comments about mediating variables must be put into the context of the very limited effectiveness seen in the largest and best designed studies, the COMMIT and CART trials. </P>
<P>
<B>Other reviews: </B>
<BR/>Several previous reviews and editorials have considered community-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Fincham-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fincham 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shea-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shea-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Susser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Susser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pyorala-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pyorala 1995</LINK>). Most have avoided, as we did, formal meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity among the available studies. We are aware of only one review that has used a meta-analytic approach to determine which aspects of study design, setting and intervention were significantly related to outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Sellers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellers 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Sellers and her colleagues reviewed 29 community heart health programmes, but were only able to use seven of these in their meta-analysis, for which they required a reference group and independent cross-sectional follow-up results. In that analysis, for changes in smoking prevalence, the setting, city versus rural or small town, had no effect; there was a smaller effect for women, and also a smaller effect for later studies. Concerning intervention components, a population plus high risk approach was no more effective than a population approach alone; print plus broadcast media were no more effective than print media alone; involvement of community members in intervention development was more effective than no involvement; and the inclusion of some environmental change (smoking policy or physical change) as a part of the intervention was more effective than none. </P>
<P>In relation to methodological characteristics, the number of units involved in a study, whether the communities were matched or not, the length of follow up, and the survey response rate had no effect on the outcome. In studies which adjusted for covariates the effect size was smaller than in those with no adjustment.</P>
<P>Several papers have commented on the methods used to evaluate community-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Fincham-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fincham 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittelmark-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittelmark 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shea-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>). An important component of the evaluation of community studies, and one that has received less prominence in the literature, is process evaluation. Glasgow and colleagues have proposed a useful framework, RE-AIM, for evaluating such public health interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 1999</LINK>). This framework, which, in addition to assessing efficacy, also assesses reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the intervention (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). As proposed by Glasgow and colleagues, numerical values for each RE-AIM component are multiplied together to give a score which can be used to rank public health interventions. Use of this framework may help our understanding of the significance of the results of community-based interventions, by linking the details of what went on with the behavioural outcomes. It may also give an indication of the likely future benefits from the extent to which the intervention is maintained in the community. </P>
<P>The studies in this review were completed before the RE-AIM framework was published. We note that of the five components, seven (22%) studies addessed two components, nine (28%) addressed three, 12 (38%) addressed four, and four (12%) addressed all five. However, except for efficacy, addressed adequately by all but one study (Tessin), the numerical detail required for the other four components was rarely found.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The failure of the largest and best conducted studies to detect an effect on prevalence of smoking is disappointing. A community approach will remain an important part of health promotion activities, but designers of future programmes will need to take account of this limited effect in determining the scale of projects and the resources devoted to them. </P>
<P>If community initiatives are undertaken, community organization, assessment of community capacity and the identification of individuals and organizations interested in supporting the smoking-related aims of the project are important during project development. Smoking needs to be recognized by the community as an important issue. Recruitment of community members to staff coalitions and task forces, and to supervise programme implementation, with skills in working with diverse groups and in health education, is strongly recommended. </P>
<P>Coalitions take several months to form, and a year or more to become effective change agents in their community. Interventions to reduce smoking among adults need to continue for several years, and should aim to make resources for smoking cessation and support for staying quit readily available throughout the community, and to develop these services if necessary. The use of mass media (print, radio and television) is especially useful for modelling behaviour change, and for changing community norms concerning smoking. It is also important to involve, train and provide smoking cessation referral services and resources for health professionals. The provision of nicotine replacement therapy or other effective medication for helping smokers quit smoking at little or no cost is becoming increasingly important.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We see several major research issues to be addressed in future community-based studies to reduce adult smoking. The first of these relates to design. Sample size and power calculations must be done, and should account for the intraclass correlations associated with cluster design. The community must be the unit of analysis.</P>
<P>Independent cross-sectional follow-up surveys best reflect intervention effectiveness at the community level, and are the method of choice for this. Cohort follow-up studies indicate intervention effectiveness at the individual level. In addition to assessing changes in smoking prevalence and quit rates during the time the intervention is in progress, smoking initiation rates should also be considered. </P>
<P>Another issue relates to secular trends in smoking. These need to be taken into account prior to the start of the interventions, and assessed again after the trial has been completed, or after the intervention programmes have been taken on by the community. </P>
<P>Although biochemical measures of smoking are not essential, an assessment of deception rates in a subsample of respondents can be reassuring, especially in the future as smoking becomes less socially acceptable and response bias more likely.</P>
<P>We recommend that the measures used to assess mediating variables become standardized, and also that the results of intermediate outcomes of ongoing and future community interventions be made available, if not in formal publications then on the world wide web.</P>
<P>We also recommend that process measures should be collected and reported, especially descriptions of community organization and project management, intervention implementation including details of organizations and services involved, programme exposure and reach, participation by community members and target groups in intervention activities, and levels of programme awareness. Descriptions of the steps taken to maintain or institutionalize programme components should also be reported.</P>
<P>Finally, we recommend that a uniform and comprehensive format be developed for reporting the results of community-based interventions, so that reviews of future trials can use a quantitative, rather than a qualitative approach.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Country: USA and Canada<BR/>Objective: To reduce the prevalence of smoking among heavy smokers, i.e. men and women smoking 25+ cigarettes per day.<BR/>Study Sites: 11 pairs of communities, 10 pairs in the United States and 1 pair in Canada. The USA sites, with the intervention communities named first for each pair, were: Vallejo and Hayward, California; Cedar Rapids and Davenport, Iowa; Fitchburg/Leominster and Lowell, Massachusetts; Paterson and Trenton, New Jersey; Santa Fe and Las Cruces, New Mexico; Yonkers and New Rochelle, New York; Utica and Binghamton/Johnson City, New York; Raleigh and Greensboro, North Carolina; Medford/Ashland and Albany/Corvallis, Oregon; Bellingham and Longview/Kelso, Washington. The Canadian sites were Brantford and Peterborough, Ontario. <BR/>Programme name: Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT).<BR/>Design: a randomized controlled design, one of each matched pair of communities being randomly assigned to receive the intervention, and the other acting as the comparison or reference community. <BR/>Analysis: Cross-sectional and cohort analyses, SUDAAN and logistic regression, 1-sided P-values, communities as the unit of analysis. For the cohort analyses, unknown outcomes were analyzed as if missing at random ( a complex stratification system was used to impute the missing outcomes), and also as if missing completely at random by omitting those with missing data in 1993. For the independent samples, beta=0.10, or 90% power to detect a 6.4 percentage point difference in smoking prevalence; for the cohort samples, there was 90% power to detect a 10% difference in quit rates.</P>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Theoretical basis: community organization and community participation.<BR/>Components: The intervention included community organization, community boards and staff, and task forces in each of the 11 intervention communities. Each community formed 4 task forces, public education, healthcare providers, worksites, and cessation resources, each with a set of key mandated activities. Intervention channels included volunteers, health professionals, teachers, worksites, churches, business, schools, public events, mass media (news and stories in newspapers, and on radio and television), posters and billboards, mailings, quit contests, self-help materials, and smoking cessation resource guides. Smoke-free policies were advocated.<BR/>Year started: 1988<BR/>Duration: 5 yrs<BR/>Maintenance: Although continuation of COMMIT activities was not a major programme goal, all communities made plans to continue some tobacco control activity. A tobacco coalition, board or other structure was found to be operating in 9/11 communities, 12-16m after the formal end of the programme and 10 communities had some level of paid staff dedicated to smoking control. Substantial activity was ongoing in 3 of the programme's 4 original channels (worksites, public education and cessation resources) and considerable smoking control activity aimed at youth was also being undertaken a year after funding was withdrawn.</P>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Theoretical basis: None stated.<BR/>Components: The health education intervention aimed to reduce smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and weight, and to increase physical activity. A school-based cardiovascular risk reduction curriculum was also developed and implemented. In-depth community organization led to the formation of 2 countywide Advisory Councils, risk factor specific task forces and programmes for nutrition, physical activity and tobacco awareness. Outreach activities were directed sequentially at every town and village, where 24 health committees were established to plan activities, such as risk factor screening, exercise events, school programmes, slide presentations, and restaurant/grocery store programmes. Implemented through volunteers, medical and dental health professionals, teachers, and community leaders, including representatives of county health departments, local hospitals, the extension service and other voluntary organizations. Channels: cardiovascular risk factor screening, worksites, churches, businesses, grocery stores, restaurants, schools, local health fairs and village festivals. Newspaper and radio were used, including articles, news items and paid advertisements, but television was not. In addition, brochures, posters, healthy heart tips, and low-literacy fact sheets were widely distributed. Components especially for smoking were smoking cessation education, referral to smoking cessation groups, the school-based smoking prevention programs, and home poster contests. <BR/>Duration: 5 yrs. <BR/>Maintenance: Many parts of the intervention were continued in the community: healthy recipe contests, senior exercise programmes, nutrition councils and others. There has been a demand for heart healthy information, the Tips have continued under another programme, and physicians note more people asking for information about their serum lipids. A local programme turned the workplace screening programme into a larger safety and health programme.</P>

<P>Country: Sweden <BR/>Objective: To reduce cardiovascular risk factors, by targeting smoking, diet, high blood pressure and weight. <BR/>Study Sites: The municipality of Norsjo in Northern Sweden.<BR/>Programme name: Vasterbotten Intervention Program<BR/>Design: Quasi-experimental, with the rural municipality of Norsjo assigned to receive the intervention. Comparison of risk factor changes was made with the population surveyed by MONICA, Northern Sweden. <BR/>Analysis: Cohort and cross-sectional analyses, t-tests, chi squared, repeated measures ANOVA, individual as the unit of analysis. Power estimates (beta) not found.<BR/>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Population of study sites: Municipality of Norsjo - 5500, Counties of Norrbotten and Vasterbotten, in Northern Sweden - 510,000.<BR/>Age: 30-60 yrs <BR/>Sex: female and male</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Theoretical basis: community participation.<BR/>Components: Community organization, a local collaborative committee and a university advisory group. Messages about lifestyle factors were disseminated by local associations, sports clubs, media and food retailers. Drama, music and informal meetings were also encouraged as a way to spread these messages. A major aspect of the intervention was risk factor screening with individual counseling by family physicians, district nurses and dieticians. In addition local government, dental services, schools and daycare centres were involved, and there was much publicity through mass media - newspapers, radio, and television. Little emphasis was placed on reducing smoking.<BR/>Year started: 1985<BR/>Duration: 6 yrs<BR/>Maintenance: It is reported that intervention activities have been continued after the formal end of the programme and were still ongoing in 2000. No further information was found.</P>

<P>Method of selection: Modified random digit dialing technique with community-specific geographic screening to identify households in targeted areas. Survey data were collected in 2 stages. During the first stage, a roster of age-eligible persons in each household was obtained and an individual, 18+, who served as a proxy, identified the age, sex and smoking status of all individuals 18+ in that household. In the second stage, an extended interview was conducted with each smoker, aged 25-64 yrs, and with a quota sample of recent ex-smokers who had quit in the past 5 yrs. Similar methodology was used for the final prevalence survey (1993). <BR/>A cohort of heavy smokers (&gt;25 cigs per day) and a cohort of light/moderate smokers (&lt;=25 cig per day) were identified in each community from among the smokers identified at baseline (1988) and followed up 5 yrs later. <BR/>

<P>Particular emphasis was placed on formative and process evaluation, the first stated purpose of which was to examine programme implementation in detail and to evaluate its short-term impact. This was achieved by 'intervention tracking'. A computer-based system tracked the amount of intervention received, and provided a historical record of the programme. All participants were asked to complete a 'contact card'. This enabled them to be tracked throughout the course of the programme. In addition to individual participation in programmes, the level of community involvement was recorded i.e. the number of community organizations and volunteers involved in programme delivery. The evaluation of individual component programmes in relation to quality and short-term impact facilitated ongoing refinement of activities. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with randomly selected programme participants. <BR/>The second main aim of process evaluation was to detect major confounding influences. 'Community tracking' was achieved through annual interviews with key informants in community agencies and provided ongoing assessments of secular trends by measuring variables such as quality of health care, social support networks and participation in healthcare initiatives and activities not associated with Pawtucket. Content analysis of major newspapers in each city for health-related articles and cigarette advertisements was undertaken.</P>

<TD>
<P>Detailed information was gathered in relation to programme exposure. Over the course of the programme 42,000 individuals participated in one or more programmes resulting in over 110,000 separate interactions with a programme designed to influence behaviour. <BR/>Although the programme reached a 'broad array of residents' no direct evidence relating dose to outcomes or comparing dose in the intervention and comparison areas was found.</P>

<P>In the cohort follow-up analyses, time to first cigarette, desire to quit, quit attempts in the past yr and the presence of another smoker in the household were assessed at baseline, but no post-intervention results for these were found. 'Smoking unacceptability' for heavy and light-to-moderate smokers did not differ between intervention and comparison conditions at the final follow-up survey in 1993. For the independent cross-sectional follow-up analyses, desire to quit, past quit attempts and methods used in trying to quit were assessed at baseline, but no post-intervention results for these were found. 'Smoking unacceptability' for smokers and recent ex-smokers did not differ between intervention and comparison conditions at the final survey in 1993.<BR/>Two attitudinal indices were devized, one addressing smoking as a public health problem (smoking control in public places, legislative control, smoking control in health settings and smoking control in schools), and the other norms and values concerning smoking (belief in the harmfulness of smoking, social actions concerning smoking and risks of second-hand smoke). <BR/>In the independent cross-sectional follow-up analyses, for all subjects, the index of smoking as a public health problem did not differ at baseline between intervention and comparison cities, and although there was a significant difference in 1993 between conditions, the extent of change within condition did not differ. For heavy smokers, perception of smoking as a public health problem did not differ at baseline between intervention and comparison cities, but differed significantly in 1993, and the change since baseline also differed significantly. For light-to-moderate smokers, perception of smoking as a public health problem did not differ at baseline between intervention and comparison cities. Although there was a significant difference in 1993 between conditions, the extent of change within condition did not differ. There were no differences in this index in 1993 for recent ex-smokers or never-smokers.<BR/>For the norms and values index, no intervention effects were observed for all subjects, nor for heavy smokers, light-to-moderate smokers, recent ex-smokers or never-smokers.<BR/>the cohort follow-up analyses, for all subjects both indices showed positive attitudinal changes favouring non-smoking, in both intervention and comparison conditions, with no significant difference between them. Subgroup analysis showed a significant intervention effect for light-to-moderate smokers, the group of smokers for whom there was a significant intervention effect on quit rates.<BR/>

<P>The evaluation included extensive procedures to track activities in both intervention and comparison communities and to monitor implementation of the intervention. The extent to which trial-wide mobilization goals were met by each community and the extent to which a standard protocol could be implemented across diverse communities was examined. Multiple methods were used. A computerized record-keeping system monitored by the co-ordinating centre tracked the implementation of required intervention activities. Extensive documentation produced by staff and volunteers e.g. annual action plans logged project activity and also recorded the community mobilization process. These were supplemented with community visits and semi-structured interviews with key volunteers. Worksite surveys examined policies and support resources for smokers, and 2 separate surveys (a telephone survey of office practices and a postal survey of individual practitioners) evaluated the impact of the health provider channel. Community surveys, surveys of religious organizations and surveys of cessation resource providers in both intervention and reference communities were also undertaken. Media coverage of tobacco-related news and information (including billboards) was tracked in all communities and annual legislative tracking assessed changes and additions to tobacco control laws. Additionally, all communities were monitored quarterly for social, political, economic and other developments that might affect the success of the project in the intervention areas or influence tobacco control activity in the reference areas. Focus groups with former COMMIT volunteers and staff in each community were undertaken to assess continuation of project activities after the formal termination of funding. A cost-tracking system monitored staff and material inputs for the economic evaluation.</P>

<P>Detailed information was gathered in relation to programme reach and exposure. COMMIT objectives established the minimum level of activity to be conducted annually in each community for the 4 intervention channels. The mean level of attainment across the 11 sites varied from 90% to 93%. Nearly all mandated activities were implemented in each intervention site. <BR/>Extensive analysis of summative survey data was also undertaken: Five receipt indices each associated with a major component of the intervention and 3 additional indices representing more general activities were summed to provide a measure of 'dose' for both intervention and control communities. The overall receipt index showed that persons in the intervention community were significantly more likely to recall exposure to smoking control activities than those in reference communities in both cohort and cross-sectional follow-up samples. However, the magnitude of mean differences in individual receipt indices between the 2 groups of communities was small. <BR/>Dose-response: Receipt index differences were computed for each community pair and correlated with differences in outcomes . In the cohort follow-up analyses, the variability across community pairs in receipt index difference did not result in a correlation with differences in quit rates among heavy smokers but there was a significant correlation among the light-to-moderate smokers among whom there was a significant behavioural change. Cross-sectional follow-up analysis showed that differences in the summary receipt indices between intervention and comparison communities were correlated significantly with differences in the quit ratio but not with differences in change in prevalence.</P>

<P>Extensive formative and process evaluation was undertaken. Individual component programmes were evaluated in relation to participation or reach, quality and impact on behaviour change. A dedicated formative evaluation group evaluated 20 to 30 approaches per yr and those that were ineffective were eliminated. The predominant methodology was the telephone survey, for example, a telephone survey was conducted to assess changes in physicians' practices in relation to risk reduction. Data about each intervention activity were logged on a computerized event history record and assigned a weight dependent on quality criteria. This enabled the production of quarterly reports showing programme contacts and programme by programme contributions. Incorporation of programme activities into the community, perceived ownership of the programme and programme sustainability were tracked.

<P>Detailed information was gathered in relation to programme exposure. Over 60% of the target population participated in the screening education programme and more than 30% were recruited to face-to-face intervention programmes (most of the young people resident in study areas were involved in school-based activities.) The increased effect observed towards the end of the study is consistent with the increased delivery of anti-smoking messages and activities late in the intervention programme. However, risk reduction activities increased over time in the control areas. Exposure was significantly higher in the education communities compared with comparison communities after 1 and 3 yrs but not after 5 or 6 yrs. No significant differences were found among smokers in intervention and comparison communities with respect to reported exposure to cessation messages. Participation in smoking cessation programmes was minimal in both intervention and comparison areas, whereas exposure to media messages regarding smoking was high. Thus the exposure data suggest that the programme may not have added a great deal to the level of risk reduction activity that may have occurred in its absence. <BR/>Dose-response: A study of the screening education programme in one community showed that 1 yr after screening, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in the intervention group.

However, fewer subjects in the treatment city had called a telephone quit line and there were no differences between cities in the number of those who had acquired written materials other than the self-help manual, participated in a group programme or received advice to quit from a general practitioner.

Implementation evaluation was conducted to determine the resources required and barriers and facilitators to implementation. Repeated awareness and participation surveys were conducted over the course of the study to measure penetration and whether objectives were being met. A variety of methods were employed to meet these aims and included consultation with the steering committee and key informants, focus group and face-to-face interviews, maintenance of journals by intervention agents and postal questionnaires. Those participating in activities were also asked to register with the programme in order that exposure could be tracked.

<P>Plans for this project included studying environmental, social and physical factors related to health behavior change, and included beliefs, cultural norms, peer influence, media influence, smoking policy and health services. Of the intermediate outcomes for which intervention effects were reported, knowledge of cardiovascular related risk factors increased in both North Karelia and Kuopio, with 10 to15% correct responses in both areas, although slightly more in North Karelia. Various health-related attitudinal measures, for example, 'considered quitting in past 6-months', and 'thinks current levels of smoking are too high', showed no major changes, and no difference between areas. Quit attempts clearly increased more in North Karelia than in Kuopio between 1972 and 1977, with less difference in quit attempts after 1977, but better maintenance rates.</P>

<TD>
<P>In order to assess feasibility of programme implementation individual activities were evaluated in relation to participation, reach, and impact on behaviour change. Numerous surveys (postal and telephone) of both the target population and professional groups within the community documented intervention progress. Frequent surveys enabled changes in intervening variables to be measured over time in order to provide insight into the process of change. The health promotion activity of local health personnel and exposure to smoking cessation advice was monitored in both experimental and control areas. Decision makers in both North Karelia and Kuopio were surveyed to assess intervention exposure and perceived adequacy of CVD control activities. Additionally, surveys of lay health workers measured their activity level, provided a descriptive account of their involvement and assessed the long-term feasibility of this approach. Content analysis of local newspapers was also conducted.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Detailed information was gathered in relation to programme exposure. Evidence comparing dose in North Karelia and Kuopio generally confirmed the effectiveness of the more active work in relation to both smoking and other risk factors in North Karelia. From 1972 to1977, a total of 1509 articles related to CVD were printed in local newspapers in North Karelia. During the same period over 1.5 million bulletins, leaflets, posters, signs, stickers and other educational materials were distributed, a total of 251 general meetings reaching over 200,000 community members were held and approximately 800 people were trained as lay opinion leaders. <BR/>Comparisons between North Karelia and Kuopio: From 1972 to 1977 there were three to four times more CVD prevention-related articles in North Karelia than in Kuopio. Local health personnel in North Karelia were found to be more active in health education measures than those in Kuopio. Although there was little difference in frequency of health-related discussions at home or in the worksite between areas, more people in North Karelia participated in organized health education meetings, and doctors and public health nurses in North Karelia made more contacts with other health professionals concerning health promotion activities than did those in Kuopio. During the first five years of intervention, smokers in both areas reported receipt of general practitioner advice to quit with equal frequency, but cessation advice was received twice as often from nurses in North Karelia. Later health behaviour surveys measuring exposure to cessation advice between 1978 and 1995 found that men in North Karelia had a significantly greater chance of being told to quit by a doctor or public health nurse than those in the control area. The same trend observed among women was not significant. Although health personnel were more attentive to patients' smoking the success of more intensive group support was not great.<BR/>Dose-response: No direct evidence relating dose to outcomes was presented. However, about 41% of smokers who had made a quit attempt in the past year stated that nobody had specifically influenced them.</P>

<P>Attitudes to smoking (intention and motivation to stop smoking, motivation to continue smoking, and confidence in quitting), quit attempts and length of longest attempt, perceptions of social support, and perceptions of family, friends and community norms concerning women smoking, were assessed at baseline (1989/90) and post-intervention (1993/4) among women smokers. Smoking environment (number of household smokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers, friends and co-workers who smoke) was also measured at baseline, but post-intervention results were not found. <BR/>Intention and motivation to stop smoking did not change significantly during the intervention in either condition and did not differ between conditions in 1993/94. Motivation to continue smoking and confidence in quitting fell significantly in both conditions, but there was no net intervention effect. The number of quit attempts in the past yr increased significantly in both conditions, but there was no net intervention effect. The length of the longest quit attempt increased significantly in the intervention counties, but not in the comparison counties, but there was no net intervention effect. Perceptions of social support fell significantly in the comparison condition and slightly in the intervention condition, but there was no net intervention effect. Perceptions of family and friends' norms concerning women smoking did not change significantly in either condition. Perceptions of community norms fell significantly in both conditions, but more so in the intervention counties, and the difference in 1993/94 was significant, indicating that women smokers in the intervention counties perceived that community members felt more negative about women smoking than in the comparison counties.<BR/>

<P>Detailed process evaluation was undertaken. Individual components e.g. telephone support system, stop smoking kit, self-help video and media use were evaluated in relation to participation or reach, quality and impact on behaviour change. Surveys of health professionals, educators and high school administrators, organizations concerned with health, and worksites in all communities were surveyed to assess practice and policy in relation to smoking. A combination of postal and telephone surveys methodology was used. A community leadership survey was also conducted to assess community involvement and perceived ownership of the programme. By measuring activity in both intervention and control areas, the process evaluation was designed to detect major confounding influences and provided an assessment of secular trends. Content analysis of newspapers in each city for health-related articles and cigarette advertisements was also undertaken.</P>

<P>Extensive formative and process evaluation was undertaken. Formative evaluation provided rapid feedback in relation to the achievement of programme objectives and also assisted the process of identifying key causal factors leading to change. Process evaluation aimed to determine how and why changes were achieved. Detailed information was gathered with regard to the implementation of individual component programmes. Specific activities (e.g. 'quit and win' contests) were evaluated in relation to reach and impact on behaviour change. Health promotion practice among general practioners and health visitors was measured along with organizational level change in both practice and policy (in hospitals, schools and workplaces). A variety of methods were employed including postal questionnaires and telephone interviews, and consultation with key individuals. Additionally, bi-annual tracking surveys across Wales measured intermediate effects. The process evaluation was also designed to detect major confounding influences. This was achieved by 1) active monitoring of events in the comparison area. 2) a retrospective study involving semi-structured interviews with health promotion managers to gather information on relevant heart health promotion activity by local health authorities in both areas and 3) market research surveys providing feedback on national initiatives particularly those involving the mass media.</P>
