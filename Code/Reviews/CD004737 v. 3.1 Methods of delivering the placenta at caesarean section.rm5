<TITLE>Placenta delivery at caesarean section</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-22 12:37:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>There are various methods of delivery of placenta at caesarean section. These include placental drainage with spontaneous delivery, cord traction and manual removal. The last two methods: cord traction (usually combined with massage or expression of the uterus) and manual removal are frequently used. The review identified 15 studies involving 4694 women. Delivery of the placenta by cord traction at caesarean section has more advantages compared to manual removal. These are less endometritis; less blood loss; less decrease in haematocrit levels postoperatively; and shorter duration of hospital stay.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-10 15:25:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Worldwide, caesarean section is the most common major operation performed on women. Some of the reported short-term morbidities include haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991</LINK>), need for blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Klapholz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klapholz 1990</LINK>), postoperative fever and endometritis (infection of the lining of the uterus) (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1990</LINK>). Long-term morbidities include placenta praevia (in which the placenta covers all or part of the cervical os), placenta accreta (in which the placenta is abnormally attached to uterine wall) and ectopic pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 1996</LINK>). There are many possible ways of performing a caesarean section operation and variations in the techniques used may increase some of the complications mentioned. A series of Cochrane Reviews on this topic is currently being compiled (<LINK REF="REF-Alderdice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderdice 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bamigboye-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamigboye 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs_x002d_Jokhan--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs-Jokhan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathai-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathai 2007</LINK>). The method of removing the placenta is one such procedure that may contribute to an increase or decrease in the morbidity of caesarean section.</P>
<P>The process of separation of the placenta starts immediately the baby is born when contraction and retraction of uterine muscles result in reduction in the size of the uterus. Consequently, the surface area of the uterus to which the placenta is attached (the placental bed) becomes smaller than the relatively incompressible placenta. As a result, the placenta is sheared off and the blood vessels supplying the now denuded placental bed are compressed by the continued contraction and retraction of the uterine muscles to reduce bleeding. Oxytocin is given either as an intravenous bolus dose, in an infusion or intramuscularly after the delivery of the baby to minimise blood loss. The value of routine oxytocics in the third stage of vaginal birth has been well established (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>). Though little direct evidence exists, it seems reasonable to assume that these benefits would apply to caesarean delivery as well.</P>
<P>Different methods for the delivery of the placenta at caesarean section have been described: (1) placental drainage with spontaneous delivery (2) cord traction and (3) manual removal. In placental drainage, the end of the umbilical cord is left unclamped and placental blood is drained and the placenta delivers spontaneously through the uterine incision (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 1995</LINK>). This method is not widely used. The two methods most frequently used are cord traction, usually combined with external massage or expression of the uterus, and manual removal. Cord traction involves gentle traction on the umbilical cord with external uterine massage after an oxytocic has been given. Manual removal is the use of the gloved hand with a gentle sawing action to separate the placenta from its implantation site. Some obstetricians commonly practise manual removal as they consider it a quicker way to deliver the placenta than awaiting spontaneous separation. The process of manual removal of the placenta may cause more bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1999</LINK>) and the introduction of a potentially contaminated hand into the uterus may increase the risk of infection (<LINK REF="STD-McCurdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McCurdy 1992</LINK>). Some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1993</LINK>) have found the procedure of manual removal of the placenta to increase postoperative morbidity, while others (<LINK REF="REF-Cernadas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cernadas 1988</LINK>) have not.</P>
<P>Caesarean section is a common operation and needs to be made as safe as possible. Techniques to reduce some of the morbidities associated with this operation are very important. The principal question is whether the practice of manual removal of the placenta at caesarean section should continue or not.</P>

<P>The sample size of the studies was variable. The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Baksu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baksu 2005</LINK>) enrolled 840 women, while two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McCurdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McCurdy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 1972</LINK>) enrolled 62 women each.</P>
<P>Twelve trials (4223 women) had adequate concealment and in three trials (543 women) (<LINK REF="STD-Dehbashi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dehbashi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sepilian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sepilian 2003</LINK>), concealment was unclear.</P>
<P>The blood loss at operation was estimated by different methods in the various trials. Blood loss was taken as both amniotic fluid and blood in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gol-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gol 2004</LINK>). In two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Magann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morales-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 2004</LINK>) the estimated liquor volume was subtracted from measured blood in the suction apparatus and the drapes/packs to determine the amount of blood loss. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ramadani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ramadani 2004</LINK>, amniotic fluid was drained to minimise absorption by packs and the difference between wet and dry packs was taken as the blood loss. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cernadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cernadas 1998</LINK>), the surgeon estimated the blood loss. Because the amniotic fluid volume would be expected to be balanced between groups and would therefore not affect the difference between measured blood losses, we combined results including and excluding amniotic fluid.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-14 10:09:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>This review shows that manual removal of the placenta at caesarean section is associated with an increased risk of postcaesarean endometritis compared with placental delivery by cord traction. Tissue trauma, entry of bacterially contaminated blood into uterine sinuses before involution of the placental implantation site, surgical contamination and increased blood loss are possible explanations for the increased endometritis (<LINK REF="STD-McCurdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McCurdy 1992</LINK>). During manual removal the placenta is directly detached from the uterine wall, leaving dilated sinuses which may be inoculated directly by bacteria from the surgeon's glove. It has been shown that in labouring women who undergo caesarean section, the glove of the dominant hand (the one that is introduced into the uterus for manual removal) of the primary surgeon is contaminated with pathogenic bacterial in 71% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Yancey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yancey 1996</LINK>). Changing gloves during manual removal does not reduce infection as the new glove still passes through the contaminated wound before contact with sinuses (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall rate of endometritis in the manual removal group was about 18.4% compared with 11.3% in the cord traction group. <LINK REF="STD-Chandra-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 2002</LINK> attributed his finding of a relatively low rate (2.5%) perhaps to the use of three doses of antibiotics instead of a single dose used in the other trials. Endometritis was not the primary objective of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ramadani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ramadani 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Blood loss was significantly greater following manual removal of the placenta. There was significant heterogeneity between the results (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%). There was no clear pattern of studies that estimated blood loss having larger treatment effects than those that measured it. In the third stage of labour, the reduction in the uterine size leads to reduction of the surface area of the placental bed. This causes shearing of the relatively incompressible placenta. Release of endogenous oxytocin causes continued retraction of the myometrium and the compression of the blood vessels supplying the placental site by the oblique muscles of the middle layer of the myometrium. This process leads to haemostasis. When the placenta is grasped and manually detached from the uterine wall it leaves no time for the described physiological process of haemostasis to take place. This leaves open dilated sinuses, which bleed until the uterine musculature eventually compresses them.</P>
<P>The concern that measurement or estimation of blood loss may have been subject to observer bias is addressed by the fact that there were significantly greater absolute and falls in haematocrit levels in the manual removal group. Change in haematocrit level is a more objective method of measuring blood loss than estimation of volume of blood loss at operation. The fall in haemoglobin levels was in the same direction, though of borderline statistical significance. Manual removal is therefore associated with significantly greater blood loss compared with delivery of the placenta by cord traction.</P>
<P>The rate of blood transfusion was similar in both groups. Few women were transfused in the included trials.</P>
<P>The duration of operation was not, overall, significantly different between groups. There was significant heterogeneity of results (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%). Seven trials showed no significant difference, while one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ramadani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ramadani 2004</LINK>) found the operating time to be significantly shorter in the manual removal group. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Morales-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 2004</LINK>) reported the interval from birth of the baby to delivery of the placenta, which was significantly shorter in the manual removal of the placenta group (P = 0.0001). Perhaps future trials should look at the time interval between the delivery of the fetus and the delivery of the placenta, as the duration of operation depends on several factors with time taken to deliver the placenta being just one of them. However, it is possible that time saved by manual removal of the placenta may be counteracted by delays in closure of the uterus related to increased bleeding.</P>
<P>Women who had manual removal had a significantly longer postoperative hospital stay. The significant morbidity associated with manual removal may be responsible. This could have cost implications though cost analyses were not done.</P>
<P>Research has shown that delayed cord clamping after vaginal birth reduces anaemia in childhood, and for preterm births reduces the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage. The timing of cord clamping was not addressed in these trials. Delaying cord clamping might allow time for placental separation prior to applying cord traction.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Delivery of the placenta by cord traction at caesarean section has more advantages than manual removal. There is less endometritis; less blood loss; less decrease in haematocrit levels postoperatively and shorter duration of hospital stay. A possible longer interval between birth of the baby and delivery of the placenta is the only disadvantage, but this did not significantly increase the overall duration of surgery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is limited information on the interval between the delivery of the infant and of the placenta, change in lochia, blood splashing during placental removal and uterine pain after the operation. However, given the clear disadvantages of manual removal of the placenta, further research employing this method may not be justified. Future research might assess the risks and benefits of uterine massage or expression during delivery of the placenta, as well as strategies for placental delivery associated with delayed clamping of the umbilical cord.</P>
