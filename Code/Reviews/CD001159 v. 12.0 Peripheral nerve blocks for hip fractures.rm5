<P>
<I>
<B>Background: </B>
</I>Peripheral nerve blocks consist of an injection of local anaesthetics close to the nerves to transiently block pain transmission to the brain. This review examined evidence from randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of peripheral nerve blocks to manage pain for people with a hip fracture.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Search dates: </B>
</I>This is an update of a previously published review. We updated the search in August 2016.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>
</I>We included 31 trials (1760 adult participants: 897 randomized to peripheral nerve blocks and 863 to no regional blockade) performed in various countries and published between 1980 and 2016.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Study funding sources:</B>
</I> Trials were funded by a charitable organization (n = 3), by a governmental organization (n = 1) or by departmental resources (n = 5), or did not specify the source of funding.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Key results: </B>
</I>Compared with other modes of analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks used to treat hip fracture pain reduce pain on movement better within 30 minutes (equivalent to a difference of -3.4 on a scale from 0 to 10 between the two analgesic regimens). The risk of pneumonia is also reduced when peripheral nerve blocks are used to treat hip fracture pain. For every 7 people with a hip fracture, one less person will suffer from pneumonia. Studies noted no major complications related to peripheral nerve blocks and reported reduced time to first mobilization after hip fracture surgery (approximately 11 hours earlier). We did not identify enough trial participants to determine if regional blockade makes a difference in terms of acute confusion, myocardial ischaemia and death within six months after surgery. Peripheral nerve block given as a single injection led to reduced cost of analgesic drugs.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Quality of evidence: </B>
</I>We rated the quality of evidence as high for reduction of pain on movement within 30 minutes, and as moderate for pneumonia, time to first mobilization and costs of analgesic drugs. We would need more information before we could draw final conclusions on effects of peripheral nerve blocks on the risk of acute confusional state, myocardial ischaemia and mortality.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-10 12:40:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 31 trials (1760 participants; 897 randomized to peripheral nerve blocks and 863 to no regional blockade). Results of eight trials with 373 participants show that peripheral nerve blocks reduced pain on movement within 30 minutes of block placement (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.14 to -0.67; equivalent to -3.4 on a scale from 0 to 10; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 90%; high quality of evidence). Effect size was proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used (P &lt; 0.00001). Based on seven trials with 676 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.27; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 48%; very low quality of evidence). Three trials with 131 participants reported decreased risk for pneumonia (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.89; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 3%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 5 to 72; moderate quality of evidence). We did not find a difference in risk of myocardial ischaemia or death within six months, but the number of participants included was well below the optimal information size for these two outcomes. Two trials with 155 participants reported that peripheral nerve blocks also reduced time to first mobilization after surgery (mean difference -11.25 hours, 95% CI -14.34 to -8.15 hours; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%; moderate quality of evidence). One trial with 75 participants indicated that the cost of analgesic drugs was lower when they were given as a single shot block (SMD -3.48, 95% CI -4.23 to -2.74; moderate quality of evidence).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-11 11:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Among women aged 55 years and older in the USA, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2000 to 2010 reported 4.9 million hospitalizations for osteoporotic fractures (2.6 million for hip fractures), 2.9 million for myocardial infarction, 3.0 million for stroke and 0.7 million for breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2015</LINK>). Osteoporotic fractures accounted for more than 40% of hospitalizations for these four outcomes, with an age-adjusted rate of 1124 admissions per 100,000 person-years. The annual total population facility-related hospital cost was highest for hospitalizations due to osteoporotic fractures (USD 5.1 billion), followed by myocardial infarction (USD 4.3 billion), stroke (USD 3.0 billion) and breast cancer (USD 0.5 billion) (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2015</LINK>). Costs of care for hip fractures are high and, when both acute care and the care needed for subsequent dependency were included, exceeded GBP 2 billion in 2012 for the UK as a whole. That same year, the overall rate of return home by 30 days was 44.6% in the UK (<A HREF="http://www.nhfd.co.uk/20/hipfractureR.nsf/">http://www.nhfd.co.uk/20/hipfractureR.nsf/</A>). In the USA, from 2003 to 2005, 5.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2% to 5.4%) of patients with hip fracture returned home in 30 days , and 52.8% of patients with hip fracture (95% CI 52.5% to 53.2%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). Hip fractures reduce life expectancies when they occur in individuals over 50 years of age. Pooled data from cohort studies revealed that the relative hazard for all-cause mortality during the first three months after hip fracture was 5.75 (95% CI 4.94 to 6.67) in women and 7.95 (95% CI 6.13 to 10.30) in men (<LINK REF="REF-Haentjens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haentjens 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The term 'hip fracture' refers to a fracture of the proximal femur down to about 5 cm below the lower border of the lesser trochanter.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-10 13:08:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regional blockade refers to injection of local anaesthetics around neural structures to transiently prevent pain transmission to the brain and may also produce motor blockade of the muscle in a specific area, depending on the type and concentration of local anaesthetic used. Local anaesthetics can be used at the spine level (neuraxial block = epidural or spinal) or around the nerves outside the spine (plexus blocks or peripheral nerve blocks). Local anaesthetic may also be infiltrated directly into wound tissues. All of these blocks can be given as single injections or by continuous infusion through a catheter to prolong their beneficial effects. Regional blockade may be used as a replacement for general anaesthesia during surgery, as adjunctive treatment for preoperative and postoperative pain or to decrease the use of intraoperative systemic drugs during general anaesthesia. Use of regional blockade as a replacement for general anaesthesia is treated in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2016</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-10 13:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most hip fractures occur in an elderly population; more than 30% of individuals are 85 years of age or older (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). Opioid-related respiratory depression may result in severe brain damage or death (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2015</LINK>). By reducing the quantity of opioids used before, during and after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2006</LINK>), regional blockade may improve the mobility of persons with hip fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2010</LINK>), potentially facilitating person's participation in rehabilitation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-10 13:13:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite their claim advantages, peripheral nerve blocks still are not widely used for people with hip fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2013</LINK>). We therefore decided to re-evaluate the beneficial/harmful effects of peripheral nerve blocks for hip fracture.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-05-11 11:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We presented results as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) along with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous data, and as mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data. If some of the continuous data were given on different scales, or when results were not provided as mean and standard deviation (SD) (therefore extracted as P values), we produced the results as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. For SMD, we considered 0.2 a small effect, 0.5 a medium effect and 0.8 a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). When data showed an effect, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) using the odds ratio. We provided results for dichotomous data as RR as often as was feasible, as the odds ratio (OR) is not easily understood by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McColl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McColl 1998</LINK>). We used OR for calculation of NNTB and NNTH (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/">http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/</A>), as this value is less likely to be affected by the side (benefit or harm) on which data are entered (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>). When we noted no effect, we calculated the optimal information size to make sure that enough participants were included in the retained studies to justify a conclusion on the absence of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html">http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html</A>).

<P>We included only parallel-group trials. If a trial included more than two groups, we fused two groups (by using the appropriate formula for adding standard deviations when required) when we thought that they were equivalent according to the criteria chosen a priori for heterogeneity exploration; we separated them and split the control group in half if we thought that they were different.</P>

<P>We contacted study authors to ask for apparently missing data. We did not consider medians as equivalent to means. Instead, we used the P value and the number of participants included in each group to calculate the effect size. We did not use imputed results.

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-05-10 13:49:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We focused specifically on comparisons with more than a small amount of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 25%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) and explored heterogeneity by using Egger&#8217;s regression intercept (to assess the possibility of a small-study effect; <LINK REF="REF-Rucker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rucker 2011</LINK>); by visually inspecting forest plots with trials placed in order according to a specific moderator, by subgrouping (categorical moderator) or by meta-regression (continuous moderator). We considered the following factors when exploring heterogeneity: type of block (psoas compartment, fascia iliaca, femoral nerve (we considered three-in-one and triple nerve blocks as femoral nerve blocks), femoral lateral cutaneous, obturator etc.), single shot versus continuous block (and duration of use), technique of localization (landmark, nerve stimulator or ultrasound), local anaesthetic concentration in lidocaine equivalent (calculated as follows: lidocaine = 1, bupivacaine = 4, chloroprocaine = 1.5, dibucaine = 4, etidocaine = 4, levobupivacaine = 3.9, mepivacaine = 0.8, prilocaine = 0.9, procaine = 0.5, ropivacaine = 3 and tetracaine = 4) (<LINK REF="REF-Berde-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berde 2009</LINK>), time when the block was performed in relation to surgery, ages of participants included, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of participants, year the study was published, delay from fracture (or hospital admission) to surgery, percentage of female participants, percentage of arthroplasty among participants and route of analgesia in the control group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence and summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We used the principles of the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>) to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with all of our primary outcomes (pain on movement 30 minutes after block placement, acute confusional state, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, death, time to first mobilization and cost of analgesic regimen for single shot blocks) and constructed <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> using GradePro (<A HREF="http://tech.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">http://tech.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro</A>). For risk of bias, we judged the quality of the evidence as presenting low risk of bias when most information came from studies at low risk of bias; we downgraded quality by one level when most information came from studies at high or unclear risk of bias (allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors) and by two levels when the proportion of information from studies at high risk of bias was sufficient to affect interpretation of results. For inconsistency, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 50% or higher without satisfactory explanation, and by two levels when the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic was 75% or higher without an explanation. We considered clinical heterogeneity as a factor for inconsistency. We did not downgrade the quality of evidence for indirectness, as all outcomes were based on direct comparisons, were performed on the population of interest and were not surrogate markers (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). For imprecision (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>), we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when the CI around the effect size was large or overlapped with absence of effect and failed to exclude an important benefit or harm (when the number of participants was lower than the optimal information size); and we downgraded quality by two levels when the CI was very wide and included both appreciable benefit and harm. For publication bias, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when correcting for the possibility of publication bias as assessed by Duval and Tweedie&#8217;s fill and trim analysis changed the conclusion. We upgraded the quality of evidence by one when the effect size was large (RR &#8804; 0.5 or &#8805; 2.0), and by two when the effect size was very large (RR &#8804; 0.2 or &#8805; 5) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>). We applied the same rules for OR when the basal risk was less than 20%. For SMD, we used 0.8 as the cutoff point for a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). We also upgraded the quality by one when we found evidence of a dose-related response. The quality was upgraded by one when a possible effect of confounding factors would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect if results show no effect. When the quality of the body of evidence is high, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. When the quality is moderate, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. When the quality is low, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. When the quality is very low, any estimate of effect is very uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

On the basis of the standard deviation in the control group of a study at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Diakomi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Diakomi 2014</LINK>: 2.4), this was equivalent to -3.4 on a scale from 0 to 10. Egger's regression intercept showed the possibility of a small-study effect as a source of heterogeneity (P = 0.02). Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis showed no evidence of publication bias. Investigators in one study may have performed the evaluation before the effect of the local anaesthetic took place in most participants (15 minutes; <LINK REF="STD-Iamaroon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Iamaroon 2010</LINK>). When a femoral nerve block using a nerve stimulator is performed with bupivacaine, the median onset time for a complete sensory and motor block would be 30 minutes (5 to 95 percentiles; 15 to 45 minutes; <LINK REF="REF-Cuvillon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuvillon 2009</LINK>). Excluding this study (<LINK REF="STD-Iamaroon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Iamaroon 2010</LINK>) and one study that did not provide the exact concentration of local anaesthetic injected (<LINK REF="STD-Murgue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Murgue 2006</LINK>) led to an effect size that was correlated with the concentration of local anaesthetic used in lidocaine equivalent (P &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). We calculated equivalences as mentioned in the methods section (i.e. lidocaine = 1, bupivacaine = 4, chloroprocaine = 1.5, dibucaine = 4, etidocaine = 4, levobupivacaine = 3.9, mepivacaine = 0.8, prilocaine = 0.9, procaine = 0.5, ropivacaine = 3 and tetracaine = 4) (<LINK REF="REF-Berde-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berde 2009</LINK>). Therefore, for <LINK REF="STD-Diakomi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Diakomi 2014</LINK>, the concentration in lidocaine equivalent was calculated as 15 mg/mL (ropivacaine 0.5% or ropivacaine 5 mg/mL multiplied by 3 = 15 mg/mL). For <LINK REF="STD-Domac-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Domac 2015</LINK>, the concentration in lidocaine equivalent was calculated as 20 mg/mL (mixture of 15 mL bupivacaine 0.5% or bupivacaine 5 mg/mL multiplied by 4 = 20 mg/mL and 2% lidocaine or lidocaine 20 mg/mL). For <LINK REF="STD-Foss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2007</LINK>, the equivalence was calculated as 8 mg/mL (mepivacaine 1% or mepivacaine 10 mg/mL multiplied 0.8 = 8 mg/mL). For <LINK REF="STD-Gille-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gille 2006</LINK>, the lidocaine equivalent was calculated as 9 mg/mL (1% prilocaine or prilocaine 10 mg/mL multiplied by 0.9 = 9 mg/mL). For <LINK REF="STD-Szucs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Szucs 2012</LINK>, the equivalence was calculated as 20 mg/mL (10 mL of 2% lidocaine or lidocaine 20 mg/mL and 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine or bupivacaine 5 mg/mL multiplied by 4 = 20 mg/mL). For <LINK REF="STD-Yun-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yun 2009</LINK>, the equivalence was calculated as 11.25 mg/mL (ropivacaine 0.375% or ropivacaine 3.75 mg/mL multiplied by 3 = 11.25 mg/mL). Results from <LINK REF="STD-Diakomi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Diakomi 2014</LINK> (mean and SD of the control group 7.5 and 2.4) show that 182 participants (91 per group) would be required in a simple trial to eliminate a difference of 1 on a 0 to 10 scale (alpha 0.05; beta 0.2; two-sided test) (<A HREF="http://stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2a.html">http://stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2a.html</A>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality of evidence for pain on movement at 30 minutes after block placement</HEADING>
<P>We downgraded the level of evidence by one because we rated five of the eight included studies as having unclear risk for blinding of outcome assessment. We did not downgrade the level of evidence on the basis of inconsistency because we found a reasonable explanation for heterogeneity. We used direct comparisons only with studies performed on the population of interest, and this is not a surrogate marker. The optimal information size was achieved, but we downgraded by one level for imprecision owing to a wide confidence interval around the effect size. We found no evidence of publication bias. We upgraded the level of evidence on the basis of a large effect size (SMD &gt; 0.8). We also upgraded the level of evidence by one on the basis of confounding factors. No study used ultrasound guidance, an approach that could have increased block success (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2015</LINK>). We upgraded the evidence by one on the basis of a dose-response relationship (effect size was proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used).

Of these nine trials, two evaluated a fascia iliaca block with bupivacaine at 15 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Godoy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Godoy 2010</LINK>) or a femoral nerve block with bupivacaine with a nerve stimulator, also at 15 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Iamaroon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Iamaroon 2010</LINK>). Because these trials may have evaluated pain scores before the block could be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Cuvillon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuvillon 2009</LINK>), we excluded them from this analysis. We retained one trial with an evaluation performed at 15 minutes with bupivacaine (<LINK REF="STD-Beaudoin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Beaudoin 2013</LINK>) because femoral nerve blocks were performed with ultrasound, and onset of a femoral nerve block may have occurred earlier with ultrasound guidance (mean 16 minutes) compared with use of a nerve stimulator (mean 27 minutes) (<LINK REF="REF-Marhofer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marhofer 1997</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-05-11 11:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found some advantages of peripheral nerve blocks versus systemic analgesia for pain treatment among people with hip fractures. Even at rest, pain after hip fracture is relatively high, particularly among those with subtrochanteric fractures (median 5 out of 10) (<LINK REF="STD-Foss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2007</LINK>). Movement in these individuals immediately after injury is unavoidable: transport from the scene of injury to the hospital, unclothing for medical examination, transport for x-ray diagnostic confirmation, transfer on the operating room table, positioning for spinal anaesthesia, etc. Movement-associated median pain ranges from 8 to 10 out of 10, depending on the type of fracture (intracapsular = 8; trochanteric = 9; subtrochanteric = 10) (<LINK REF="STD-Foss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2007</LINK>). As many of these patients are elderly (30% over 85 years of age; <LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>), doses of systemic opioids administered are often limited by the fear of inducing serious adverse events such as respiratory depression in a patient with a full stomach. Compared with systemic analgesia, pain on movement within 30 minutes after block placement will be less by approximately 3.4 out of 10 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; high quality of evidence). Single shot blocks have been successfully performed by emergency physicians (<LINK REF="STD-Beaudoin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Beaudoin 2013</LINK>) or even by trained paramedics at the scene of injury (<LINK REF="STD-McRae-2015" TYPE="STUDY">McRae 2015</LINK>) without excessive rate of serious complications. Although continuous blocks require greater expertise and are more expensive (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>) than single shot blocks, they may be more suitable than single shot blocks for use in the emergency department and thereafter. Owing to a possibly increased rate of morbidity induced by a longer delay between injury and surgery, authorities usually recommend proceeding to surgical repair of hip fractures as soon as is feasible. However, the delay between hospital arrival and surgery (from 24 to 240 hours in the present review) often exceeds the duration of a single shot block (median between 12 and 22 hours, depending on the drug(s) used; <LINK REF="REF-Cuvillon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuvillon 2009</LINK>), thus leading to the need for a repeated block (<LINK REF="STD-Kullenberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kullenberg 2004</LINK>) or reversion to systemic analgesia. Continuous nerve blocks inserted at the emergency department would offer the advantage of covering both preoperative and postoperative analgesia. The exact type of regional block chosen may reflect the preference/training of the practitioner's personnel. However, some study authors have found it particularly difficult to insert epidural analgesia in the emergency department (<LINK REF="STD-Luger-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2012</LINK>). Compared with epidural analgesia or psoas compartment blocks, femoral nerve or fascia iliaca blocks may offer several advantages. First, they can be performed with the patient lying in the dorsal decubitus position, and second, as they usually are considered superficial/compressible sites, patients are able to receive any mode of thromboprophylaxis deemed required by their practitioner to suit their medical and surgical condition. When available, ultrasound guidance may be advantageous in terms of decreasing the onset time of the block effect (<LINK REF="REF-Marhofer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marhofer 1997</LINK>) and increasing the success rate (more blocks have been assessed as sufficient for surgery following sensory or motor testing, and fewer blocks required supplementation or conversion to general anaesthetic, <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2015</LINK>). The concentration of local anaesthetic used for catheter loading or for performance of a single shot block at the site of injury or in the emergency department should be relatively high. At this phase, a motor block probably poses no clear disadvantage provided that adequate traction/immobilization is ensured, and the effect on pain on movement will be proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Owing to the high incidence of acute confusional state seen in these patients, appropriate fixation of these catheters is crucial (<LINK REF="STD-Cuvillon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cuvillon 2007</LINK>), and all connections between the pump and the catheter must be secured (<LINK REF="STD-Szucs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Szucs 2012</LINK>). If a femoral nerve or a fascia iliaca block is chosen, additional regional blockade will be required for surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Chudinov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chudinov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2016</LINK>). For postoperative analgesia, the difference between peripheral nerve blocks and systemic analgesia was less consistent and may be influenced by the surgical technique (fixation vs arthroplasty; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) and/or type of block used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Use of regional blockade for postoperative analgesia reduces time to first mobilization (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>), hence reducing some complications that may occur secondary to immobilization, such as pneumonia (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; moderate quality of evidence). Use of regional blockade for postoperative analgesia may reduce the risk of pneumonia by half (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 to 72). Our review includes data for time to first mobilization with single shot blocks only. Concerns about risks of inpatient falls have been raised when continuous lower limb peripheral nerve blocks are used for postoperative analgesia. Detailed analysis, however, has revealed that attributable risk for patients who had a continuous peripheral nerve block was not outside the expected probability of postoperative falls after orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2013</LINK>). One large retrospective trial found that risk for inpatient falls was higher among older patients, those with a higher comorbidity burden and those with more major complications, but that use of peripheral nerve blocks was not significantly associated with inpatient falls (<LINK REF="REF-Memtsoudis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Memtsoudis 2014</LINK>). Inpatient falls occur mainly while patients are within their own rooms (while in the bathroom, while going to and from the bathroom or while using a bedside commode) (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2014</LINK>). Therefore, with or without peripheral nerve block, fall prevention strategies should continue to include education for all patients (especially elderly patients) and should reinforce practices that monitor patients within their hospital rooms (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute confusional state is common after hip fracture and may delay rehabilitation and increase hospital length of stay and may impede nursing home placement and even mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Pompei-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pompei 1994</LINK>). We could not demonstrate a decreased risk of acute confusional state with the use of peripheral nerve blocks, but the number of participants included in the present meta-analysis is insufficient to eliminate a clinically relevant risk reduction (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.27; very low quality of evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The pathophysiology of acute confusional state in these patients may be multi-factorial and may include side effects of medications used, hypoxaemia, immobilization, infection and systemic inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-Mouzopoulos-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mouzopoulos 2009</LINK>). Peripheral nerve blocks (or local anaesthetics) may have an influence on any of these factors. Also, peripheral nerve blocks are associated with a clear reduction in opioid consumption (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.70, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.44; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).</P>
<P>We could not demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of myocardial ischaemia (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; very low quality of evidence), but the number of participants included in our review was clearly insufficient to permit definitive conclusions on this. Likewise, we did not find a reduction in short-term (up to six months) mortality rate (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; low quality of evidence), but here again, included participants were too few to allow definitive conclusions on this.</P>
<P>Participant satisfaction was also higher when peripheral nerve blocks were used as a modality of pain treatment (SMD 0.91, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.20; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>; equivalent to a difference of 1.0 on a scale from 1 to 10).</P>
<P>No trials reported major complications. This is consistent with information derived from large prospective studies indicating that the incidence of nerve injury lasting longer than six months associated with femoral nerve blocks would be relatively low: 0 to 1.2 per 1000 procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Auroy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auroy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brull-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brull 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sites-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sites 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>In our previous version of this review (<LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>), we found that regional blockade reduces pain and opioid consumption, but owing to the limited number of studies available, we did not find a difference between regional blockade and other modes of analgesia in terms of major outcomes. In the present version, we confirm that peripheral nerve blocks reduce pain on movement within 30 minutes after block placement (high quality of evidence) and opioid consumption. We also found a reduction in pneumonia and in time to first mobilization (moderate quality of evidence). We need more data before we can determine if regional blockade influences acute confusional state, myocardial ischaemia and death rates.</P>

<P>High-quality evidence shows that peripheral nerve blocks reduce pain on movement within 30 minutes after block placement, and moderate-quality evidence shows that they reduce risk of pneumonia, time to first mobilization and cost (single-injection blocks only). Included trials often excluded patients with dementia (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). These patients may be uncooperative and less suitable for awake regional anaesthetic techniques. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia suggests that regional anaesthetic techniques should not be performed routinely in adult patients whose sensorium is compromised by general anaesthesia or deep sedation, but that adult patients with specific conditions (e.g. developmental delay) may be appropriate exceptions to this recommendation after risk versus benefit is considered (<LINK REF="REF-Neal-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 2015</LINK>).</P>

<B>Treatment group:</B>
</I> An ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block will be placed with 1% ropivacaine. An ultrasound vascular probe is placed to locate structures anatomically: The main structures were the femoral nerve itself, the femoral artery and vein and the fascia iliaca. Then under real-time ultrasound guidance via an out-of-plane approach, 15 mL of 1% ropivacaine is injected around the femoral nerve as visualized. A 2-person technique is employed with the needle attached to the syringe of ropivacaine via a 90 cm minimum volume extension set. The probe and needle operator is present along with an assistant who injects the anaesthetic. Digital pressure is then placed for 30 seconds just distal to the injection site. The entire procedure takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Objective measure of the nerve block is assessed at 30 minutes by testing sensation over the anterolateral aspect of the thigh</P>
