<P>We have split the original review on interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer into two reviews; the findings on interventions for sexual dysfunction for men following cancer treatments will now be reported in a separate review. We changed the inclusion criteria to only include interventions specifically developed to treat sexual dysfunction; this led to the exclusion of a study previously included because it was a preventative study. We have added 11 new trials and the conclusions have changed in the light of this new evidence.</P>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In women sexual dysfunction is a potential complication of many types of cancer treatments.</P>
<P>This review evaluated the effectiveness of treatments (interventions) of any kind, for example drugs or exercise, for treating sexual dysfunction in women following cancer treatment.</P>
<P>The review is an update of one published in 2007 that assessed the effectiveness of interventions for men and women. We decided to present this revised review separately for women because of the increase in the number of trials. Another review for men is underway.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 11 new trials on interventions for women in September 2015. We excluded one trial that was included in the earlier version of this review because it assessed treatment for preventing sexual dysfunction and was no longer relevant to this review. Interventions differed in their content and how the researchers measured benefit. Eight of the interventions involved psychological support such as counselling on sexual matters, or peer support. One of the others was of a testosterone cream, another tested a vaginal pH-balanced gel and the other was of pelvic floor exercise. The findings from six of the trials are weak because they involved small numbers of women.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Across the trials the impact on sexual function was different. This makes it difficult to derive clear conclusions. For instance, in those that evaluated a psychological support treatment, four studies found that it improved some measures of sexual function but not others, but five found that it did not improve sexual function according to any of the measures used. For the other interventions tested, only the trial of the vaginal gel found improvements in sexual function and no side effects were reported. Only one of the psychological interventions reported that no harm occurred because of the intervention. The other trials of psychological support did not assess harm. This is an important gap as some women may find it distressing to discuss personal sexual problems as part of their treatment.</P>
<P>Further evaluations are needed for all interventions. Current studies have only explored effectiveness in women with gynaecological and breast cancers, but there is a risk of sexual problems after treatments for other cancers. New evaluations need to involve larger numbers of participants.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:08:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:06:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>The proportion of people living with and surviving cancer is growing. This has led to increased awareness of the importance of quality of life, including sexual function, in those affected by cancer. Sexual dysfunction is a potential long-term complication of many cancer treatments. This includes treatments that have a direct impact on the pelvic area and genitals, and also treatments that have a more generalised (systemic) impact on sexual function.</P>
<P>This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2007, on interventions for treating sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer for men and women. Since publication in 2007, there has been an increase in the number of trials for both men and women and this current review critiques only those for women. A review in press will present those for men.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:06:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for treating sexual dysfunction in women following treatments for cancer. To assess adverse events associated with interventions.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:06:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts and the NHS Research Register. The searches were originally run in January 2007 and we updated these to September 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:06:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of a treatment for sexual dysfunction. The trial participants were women who had developed sexual dysfunction as a consequence of a cancer treatment. We sought evaluations of interventions that were pharmaceutical, mechanical, psychotherapeutic, complementary or that involved physical exercise.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:07:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. We considered meta-analysis for trials with comparable key characteristics.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:08:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Since the original version of this review we have identified 11 new studies in women. The one study identified in the earlier version of this review was excluded in this update as it did not meet our narrower inclusion criteria to include only interventions for the treatment, not prevention, of sexual dysfunction.</P>
<P>In total 1509 female participants were randomised across 11 trials. All trials explored interventions following treatment either for gynaecological or breast cancer. Eight trials evaluated a psychotherapeutic or psycho-educational intervention. Two trials evaluated a pharmaceutical intervention and one pelvic floor exercises. All involved heterosexual women. Eight studies were at a high risk of bias as they involved a sample of fewer than 50 participants per trial arm. The trials varied not only in intervention content but in outcome measurements, thereby restricting combined analysis. In the trials evaluating a psychotherapeutic intervention the effect on sexual dysfunction was mixed; in three trials benefit was found for some measures of sexual function and in five trials no benefit was found. Evidence from the other three trials, two on different pharmaceutical applications and one on exercise, differed and was limited by small sample sizes. Only the trial of a pH-balanced vaginal gel found significant improvements in sexual function. The trials of pharmaceutical interventions measured harm: neither reported any. Only one psychological intervention trial reported that no harm occurred because of the intervention; the other trials of psychological support did not measure harm.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:08:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Since the last version of this review, the new studies do not provide clear information on the impact of interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer in women. The sexual dysfunction interventions in this review are not representative of the range that is available for women, or of the wider range of cancers in which treatments are known to increase the risk of sexual problems. Further evaluations are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-25 14:37:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2007) on 'Interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer' (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2007</LINK>). This review presents the findings on the effectiveness and safety of interventions for sexual dysfunction in women following treatments for cancer. In its earlier version the review involved interventions for both men and women following treatments for cancer, and preventative treatments for sexual dysfunction. A separate review, in press, will report on interventions for men. Interventions for the prevention of sexual dysfunction are not included in either of these reviews.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:12:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Sexual dysfunctions are characterised by a disturbance in sexual desire and in the psychological and physiological changes that characterise the sexual response (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_5-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-5 2013</LINK>)).</P>
<P>The DSM-5 recognises three sexual dysfunctions in women:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>sexual interest/arousal disorder;</LI>
<LI>genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder;</LI>
<LI>female orgasmic disorder.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Sexual dysfunction poses challenges to one's social, mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. In cancer, it is an important indicator of quality of life both in people undergoing treatments and in those surviving the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ozyilkan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozyilkan 1995</LINK>). It may occur as a result of the nature of a cancer, such as a cancer that affects the mechanics or hormonal pathways in sexual function, as a result of the treatment for cancer such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy that may have local or systemic and hormonal effects, and it may occur from the emotional trauma of receiving a diagnosis or indeed living with cancer for the patient as well as their sexual partner. The causes of sexual dysfunction following cancer treatments may be multi-factorial but it may often result from the direct effects of the treatment. A hysterectomy, for example, may disrupt the pelvic anatomy and the local nerve supplying the pelvic floor, which are part of the trunk stability mechanism involved in sexual arousal, and this may be accompanied by loss of vaginal lubrication and sensation (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006</LINK>). Other cancer treatments may affect sexual function, for example chemotherapy may induce the symptoms of menopause, in particular vaginal dryness. Sexual dysfunction following a cancer treatment may also relate to lowered physical fitness, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and changes to self esteem and feelings of sexuality (<LINK REF="REF-Greenwald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwald 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pignata-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignata 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiggins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiggins 2008</LINK>). Although some treatment-related sexual dysfunction effects are short-term, sexual dysfunction is one of the more prevalent long-term complications following many types of life-saving cancer treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ananth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Syrjala-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syrjala 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sexual dysfunction following cancer treatments is becoming an increasingly important issue to tackle. With an aging global population, improved diagnosis and better cancer treatments, more people are living with and surviving cancer. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the number of cancer survivors in the US increased from 3 million in 1971 to 11.6 million in 2007, and of those in 2007 the largest group of survivors in women was those with breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2011</LINK>). Sexual dysfunction is a known problem for people receiving various cancer treatments, including those for cancer of the bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zippe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zippe 2004</LINK>), head and neck (<LINK REF="REF-Low-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2008</LINK>), and rectum (<LINK REF="REF-Hendren-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendren 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2011</LINK>). However, much of the research to date on the prevalence and treatments for sexual dysfunction following cancer treatments has focused on cancer treatments that have a direct impact on the genitals or other areas of the body involved in sexual functioning. It has been estimated that 50% of women who undergo gynaecological cancer treatments suffer long-term sexual dysfunction as a result (<LINK REF="REF-National-Cancer-Institute-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Cancer Institute 2012</LINK>). There is also evidence for a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction following treatments for breast cancer, where in one survey it was found in 45% women (<LINK REF="REF-Kedde-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kedde 2013</LINK>), and in another survey 76% had sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Goldfarb-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldfarb 2009</LINK>). A review found that the incidence of sexual dysfunction in women following radical rectal cancer resection varied from 19% to 62% (<LINK REF="REF-Cowan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowan 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite recognition of the problem, sexual morbidity remains under-treated in this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2011</LINK>). This is, in part, because of the embarrassment associated with sexual dysfunction not only from the patient's point-of-view but from that of clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Dening-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dening 2013</LINK>). In addition, sexual interest/arousal disorders in general may be under-recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-25 14:37:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>There are various types of interventions available for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in women, these include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>complementary and alternative medicine interventions such as the herbal therapies ginkgo and ginseng;</LI>
<LI>exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor;</LI>
<LI>mechanical interventions such as lubricating gels and clitoral therapy devices;</LI>
<LI>pharmacological interventions including hormonal therapies such as testosterone or oestrogen (these may be applied topically or taken orally);</LI>
<LI>psychotherapeutic and psycho-educational interventions such as counselling or psychotherapy, which aim to reduce the sexual dysfunction as well as improve the patient's communication skills with their sexual partner. Psychotherapeutic interventions may be combined with education to facilitate an understanding of treatment and it effects.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The range of interventions is in part explained by the range of causes of sexual dysfunction, but also because it is known that the appropriateness, effectiveness and suitability of each intervention vary between individual patients.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:14:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>The various types of interventions work in different as well as complex ways, with some mechanisms of action poorly understood. We briefly consider the mechanisms of action according to the following groupings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complementary and alternative medicine</HEADING>
<P>There are various complementary and alternative medicines that are used to try to enhance sexual function. Their mechanisms of action are often unknown. Maca is an Andean plant belonging to the mustard family and it has been used for centuries to enhance fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Shin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 2010</LINK>). Maca is also reported to improve sexual function in healthy human populations (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 2003</LINK>). <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> has been evaluated for depression-induced sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor</HEADING>
<P>Pelvic floor muscles give structural support to the pelvic organs (urethra, vagina and rectum). Pelvic floor dysfunction may be a direct outcome of gynaecological cancers and various cancer treatments. For example, radical hysterectomy and radiotherapy of the pelvic area may disrupt the anatomy and the local nerve supply to the pelvic floor muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006</LINK>). This disruption may lead to urinary continence and a lack of sexual arousal. Pelvic floor exercises may reduce these problems by increasing muscle tone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mechanical</HEADING>
<P>There are various mechanical devices for sexual dysfunction. In women a clitoral therapy device such as a hand-held battery powered vacuum creates a gentle suction to engorge the clitoris blood flow and thereby increase sensation (<LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacological</HEADING>
<P>The relationship between endogenous testosterone levels and sexual function in women has not been clearly established. However, testosterone therapy has been found to improve the signs and symptoms of hypoactive sexual desire (<LINK REF="REF-Hubayter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubayter 2008</LINK>). Exogenous oestrogen will increase vaginal blood flow and lubrication, and oestrogen therapy has been shown to improve clitoral sensitivity and the ability to reach orgasm (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychotherapeutic and psycho-educational</HEADING>
<P>Although evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions is limited, the role of psychological processes in sexual function is acknowledged (<LINK REF="REF-Kazdin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazdin 2009</LINK>). Normal sexual function is a biopsychosocial process that relies on the co-ordination of not only endocrine, vascular and neurological factors but also psychological factors (<LINK REF="REF-Allahdadi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allahdadi 2009</LINK>). Treatment of sexual dysfunction in women with a psychotherapeutic intervention is a common approach in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Berner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berner 2012</LINK>). There are a number of psychotherapy approaches including cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling and relationship therapy. Some interventions may include educational aspects, such as a discussion on the value of intimate communication with sexual partner and advice on vaginal lubrication.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:14:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Trials evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for sexual dysfunction often exclude patients with other major health problems, such as cancer. As cancer and its treatments disrupt physiological and anatomical integrity, it is not possible to simply extrapolate the results of these trials into the cancer field.</P>
<P>With the world's aging population, and improved diagnosis and better cancer treatments, more people are living with and surviving cancer. It is recognised that sexual morbidity is a major cause of poor quality of life. A growing number of treatments are being developed and evaluated; it is important to review their efficacy, safety and acceptability. This review is an update of an earlier Cochrane review on interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer in men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2007</LINK>). Since its publication many more trials have been undertaken. In light of this growth we have split this review. In this current update we evaluate only interventions for women. The update on interventions for men will be reported elsewhere in a new review.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:15:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Trial participants were women (aged 16 years or over), receiving any active treatment for any cancer or who had previously received any treatment for cancer. Participants must have been functioning sexually with a partner prior to cancer treatment. Participants at the start of the trial needed to have experienced any type of sexual dysfunction (however identified) subsequent to cancer treatment. If participants were not required for trial inclusion to have sexual dysfunction subsequent to cancer treatment, we included the study if it reported:</P>
<UL>
<LI>50% or more having sexual dysfunction following treatment;</LI>
<LI>subgroup analysis on those with documented sexual dysfunction subsequent to cancer treatment;</LI>
<LI>mean/average score in both trial arms at early measurement post-treatment indicating a level of sexual dysfunction.</LI>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:17:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Two authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, resolving any disagreements by discussion (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study. We assessed the following for each study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process: random number table; computer random number generator); and unclear risk of bias (method used to generate sequence not clearly stated). We excluded studies using a non-random process, which were therefore at high risk of bias (odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions before assignment determines whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); and unclear risk of bias if the method was not clearly stated. We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation, which were therefore at high risk of bias (open list).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias if the study stated that it was blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding: identical tablets, matched in appearance and smell; and unclear risk of bias if the study stated that it was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how blinding was achieved. We judged a study as high risk if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome was likely to have been influenced by lack of blinding. We also judged a study as high risk if blinding was attempted but it was likely that the blinding could have been broken and the outcome was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). We assessed whether there was attrition bias due to the amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data. We judged the study as having low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data or the reasons for missing data were unlikely to be related to true outcome, or missing data and reasons for it were similar across trial arms, or the missing data had been imputed using appropriate methods. We judged the study as high risk if the reason for missing outcome data was likely to be related to the outcome, with either imbalance across trial arms in numbers of reasons for missing data and if an inappropriate application of simple imputation was potentially used. We judged the study as unclear risk if there was insufficient reporting of attrition to permit judgement of low or high risk.</LI>
<LI>Sample size (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies have been shown to overestimate treatment effects, probably because the conduct of small studies is more likely to be less rigorous, allowing critical criteria to be compromised (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK>). We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they had 200 participants or more, at unclear risk if they had 50 to 200 participants, and at high risk if they had fewer than 50 participants.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting (checking if there was a selection of a subset of the original variables recorded on the basis of the results). We assessed selective outcome reporting, if a protocol was available, by comparing outcomes in the protocol and published report. If they were the same we assessed it as low risk in this domain, if they differed we considered it as high risk. If a protocol was not available, then we compared the outcomes listed in the methods section of an article with the outcomes for which results were reported. If they differed we considered the study as high risk. If a protocol was not available and even though the outcomes listed in the methods section and the results section were the same, we considered the study as having an unclear risk of bias in this domain.</LI>

For data arising from RCTs with a cross-over design, if available, we planned to use in any combined analysis only data from the first comparative phase prior to cross-over. This decision was based on the possibility of a 'carry-over' of treatment effect from the experimental or comparative treatment.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:16:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Missing studies can result from an inadequate search for data or from publication bias in that papers with negative findings are less likely to be published. How we dealt with this is detailed in <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007617.pub2/full#CD007617-sec2-0002">Search methods for identification of studies</A> and in <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007617.pub2/full#CD007617-sec3-0014">Assessment of reporting biases</A>.</P>
<P>We anticipated finding a significant amount of loss to follow-up in this review. This was due either to the patient's declining health and the caregiver's need for more time with their loved one, or because of the death of the patient. We report attrition rates, per trial, in the 'Risk of bias' tables (see <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007617.pub2/tables#CD007617-sec2-0018">Characteristics of included studies</A>). This included, if available, per trial arm reasons for attrition, and whether the trial analysis entailed any re-inclusions. We did not undertake any imputation for missing participant data.</P>
<P>A common item missing in outcome data is the standard deviation for continuous outcomes. Where data were not reported, but might be available, we attempted to contact the study authors. We attempted contact with them up to two times. If contact with the author was not possible, we planned to calculate or impute this using relevant data, only if a minority of the trials (to be combined in a meta-analysis) had a missing standard deviation (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007617.pub2/full#CD007617-bbs2-0056">Higgins 2008</A>). If we had undertaken such imputation we planned to perform sensitivity analyses to assess its impact on combined analysis.</P>
<P>We did not exclude trials on the basis of missing data. In the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007617.pub2/full#CD007617-sec1-0006">Discussion</A> section we address the potential impact of missing data on the findings of the review.</P>

Two studies compared different forms of delivery of an intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2013</LINK>), and two used wait-list controls (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>). Four trials involved samples of fewer than 50 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svensk 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2012</LINK>). Four had samples of over 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>). None of the trials reported drug, staff or project pharmaceutical funding or affiliation.</P>
<P>All trials involved participants that had breast or gynaecological cancer. Where reported, the mean age of participants ranged across trials from 44 to 57 years. The treatments the participants underwent for cancer were surgery, radiation, endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy.</P>
<P>As per the inclusion criteria participants in the majority of trials had documented poor sexual functioning following a cancer treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svensk 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2012</LINK>). We included another trial as the authors were explicit in assuming that for a high proportion of the participants the cancer treatment would result in sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2015</LINK>). Across the studies how sexual dysfunction was measured varied. This included self report and scales specifically developed for the project. Validated tools used included the Changes of Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Clayton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 1997</LINK>), Derogatis Inventory of Sexual Functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Derogatis-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derogatis 1979</LINK>), the Female Sexual Distress Revised Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Derogatis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derogatis 2008</LINK>), Female Sexual Function Index (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 2000</LINK>), and the sexual function subscale of the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Baessler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baessler 2009</LINK>). Only one trial specifically set out to only include those with severe sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>), although in two other trials the scores obtained on the scales used for sexual dysfunction suggested overall a significant problem (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>). One trial evaluated sexual outcomes in both the women and their partners (<LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>All involved participants were in a couple relationship, although only two of the trials documented that participants were sexually active prior to the cancer treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>). In three trials the intervention was started during active treatment for cancer of surgery, radiography or chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svensk 2009</LINK>); for one of these studies the treatment, radiology, was ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Svensk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svensk 2009</LINK>). In one other trial the intervention was started just after the treatment for cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2010</LINK>). In another the mean number of months since treatment for cancer ended was 24.3 in the intervention group and 31.3 in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>). In the remaining six trials time since cancer treatment was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In three trials the effect of the intervention on sexual dysfunction was the primary focus (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2013</LINK>). In five of the other trials there was no declared primary outcome; in four of these sexual dysfunction was one of several measures of wellbeing, including quality of life, mental health and distress, body image, spiritual wellbeing and personal growth (<LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svensk 2009</LINK>). In the fifth trial the other measures related to the impact of an exercise intervention on pelvic floor muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2012</LINK>). In the other two included studies sexual dysfunction was a secondary outcome; in one the primary outcome was feasibility of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>), and in the other mental health (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>One cross-over trial of 150 women with cancer evaluated the effect of testosterone 2% in Vanicream versus plain Vanicream in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2007</LINK>). As per the inclusion criteria, at baseline all participants had a decrease in sexual desire. This was defined as a score of less than 8 on a 0- to 10-point scale with 10 being highest interest (actual scores not provided). Participants were instructed to apply a spoonful of the cream (intervention treatment or control) onto a large area of their abdomen or thighs. The trial reported cross-over periods separately and so according to our protocol we only report the pre-cross-over results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Sexual function</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes for sexual desire/interest and frequency of desire were captured using the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Clayton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 1997</LINK>). The overall score for the scale runs from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing poorer outcome.</P>
<P>Using the CSFQ for the summed score of desire/interest and frequency of desire it was found that there was no significant difference in effect between the trial arms. The first cross-over mean score in the intervention group was 48.53 and in the control group it was 44.41. The mean difference (MD) in change from baseline was 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.78 to 4.94). Neither was there a significant difference in the CSFQ subscale on feelings of sexual pleasure (MD 4.67, 95% CI -0.10 to 9.44) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the actual scores).</P>

The women had experienced menopause after chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. In both trial arms, participants at baseline reported a high degree of dyspareunia. On a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being the highest score for dyspareunia, the baseline mean in the intervention group was 8.23 (standard deviation (SD) 0.99) and in the control group 8.20 (SD 0.95). Likewise the score (using the same scoring system) for vaginal dryness with pain was high: in the intervention group it was 8.20 (SD 0.83) and in the control group 7.92 (SD 0.89).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Sexual function</HEADING>
<P>Effectiveness of the gel was measured by whether it reduced dyspareunia and vaginal dryness. This was measured using a visual analogue scale of 0 to 10 with higher scores reflecting poorer function/more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>At 12 weeks of treatment there was a significant difference favouring those in the intervention group in reduced dyspareunia and other measures of vaginal health, including reduced vaginal dryness (mean dyspareunia 5.48 (SD 1.06) in the intervention group, mean dyspareunia 6.11 (SD 1.42) in the control group; MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.13); mean vaginal dryness 4.23 (SD 1.40) in the intervention group and 6.51 (SD 1.51) in the control group; MD -2.28, 95% CI -2.85 to -1.71).</P>

<P>This diversity and complexity of interventions precluded any taxonomy of simple labels that would accurately summarise efficacy per intervention type. It also precluded classification into general themes and groups. Moreover the trials varied in how they measured impact on sexual functioning, with five not reporting their findings in a way that was appropriate for combined analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schover-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schover 2013</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2015</LINK> tested whether a specialist nurse counselling service compared to usual care would improve sexual satisfaction in 70 women following a hysterectomy for gynaecological cancer. Sexual dysfunction was not measured at baseline, however the authors assumed that most of the women would develop sexual problems because of their cancer treatments. The nurses visited the women in the intervention group three times a week until hospital discharge, and subsequently at home at one and 12 weeks. The nurse discussed sexual problems with the women including body image, self confidence, the fear of being rejected, loss of desire, sexual intercourse, vaginal sensitivity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, inability to reach orgasm, shortening of the vagina and incomplete penis penetration.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baucom-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baucom 2009</LINK> conducted a pilot study of 14 couples, in which the wife had early-stage breast cancer. Mean baseline sexual functioning in both trial arms using the sexual drive and relationship subscale of the Derogatis Inventory of Sexual Functioning (DISF-SR) suggested a level of sexual dysfunction. Higher scores suggested greater sexual function, drive and satisfaction, and better relationship. For both trials arms the score was below mid-score (16) on this subscale, with a mean score of 11.50 in the intervention group and a mean score of 10.33 in the comparison group. All women had received cancer treatment and in most cases it involved surgery. Couples were randomised to either counselling for relationship enhancement or an active control of provision of a list of community support services. The intervention used a cognitive behavioural approach and consisted of six sessions in which the therapist discussed with the couple how to share feelings and thoughts and to reach decisions jointly. The focus was on cancer-related topics including fear, mortality, sexuality and body image.</P>
<P>The small number of participants meant that inferential statistics were not used.

<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2013</LINK>, in a feasibility study, included 27 women who were sexually distressed following gynaecological cancer treatment. In this trial they sought to identify women whose distress was "above and beyond what might ordinarily occur for women with gynaecologic cancer". This was defined as scoring at least 24 on the Female Sexual Distress Revised Scale. This is higher than the recommended cutoff of 11 for sexual distress. Actual baseline scores were not provided.</P>
<P>The women had received, on average two to three years earlier, surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer and were randomised in the study to an online support group, GyneGals, or a wait-list control. The aim of the 12-week online support group was to address the psychosexual impact of cancer and its treatments. It involved a closed group discussion forum moderated daily by two psychologists, who posted weekly a message on the forum to introduce discussion topics such as coping with emotional challenges or exploring sexuality. A dedicated website provided psycho-educational material to support the discussion.</P>

The trial compared four weeks of pelvic floor muscle training with a control group receiving no training. At the start of the intervention in both trial arms the overall mean for sexual function using the sexual function subscale of the Pelvic Floor Questionnaire indicated sexual dysfunction. Total scores on the scale ranged from 0 to 20. Eight items on the scale covered sufficient lubrication, vaginismus, coital incontinence, vaginal laxity, dyspareunia and 'sexual bother'.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-01-25 14:48:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This is the first update of the 2007 Cochrane systematic review on interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatment for cancer in women (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2007</LINK>). The original publication included interventions for men and for women. It identified only one trial of an intervention for women. This trial was not included in this update as it no longer fitted the tighter inclusion criteria, which excluded trials on preventative treatments. Since the original review, as demonstrated in our identification of 11 new trials and two in progress, there has been much more research interest in interventions for women. Three-quarters of the trials evaluated interventions that involved a psychotherapeutic element; the others evaluated a pharmaceutical gel, testosterone cream and a pelvic floor exercise. The trials involved women with gynaecological or breast cancer. Overall, the trials were mostly not of high quality as they under-reported design features. Three were pilot or feasibility studies involving small samples and in which the primary aim was not to test effectiveness. We did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated a complementary or alternative medicine intervention.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-25 14:48:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>The variation in interventions evaluated, including between those that involved a psychotherapeutic element, is the main reason why there is no combined analysis in this review. Psychotherapeutic interventions involved sexual counselling, art therapy, peer support or relationship therapy; overall they showed a mixed effect on sexual functioning. The evidence that testosterone cream, pH-balanced vaginal gel or pelvic floor exercise improves sexual function is weak. The evidence for each of these interventions is limited to one study and involved in three of the four studies fewer than 50 participants per arm. Evidence on potential harms was under-reported in all studies. This is apart from the trial on a topical cream and the one on a pH-balanced vaginal gel, which reported no significant increase in adverse effects in those in the intervention group compared to those allocated a placebo. Surprisingly few trials assessed quality of life, mental health or physiological functioning, therefore it is difficult to derive any conclusions on the effect of these interventions on these outcomes. The two trials of pharmaceutical interventions measured harm and neither reported any. Only one of the psychological intervention trials reported that no harm occurred because of the intervention; the other trials did not measure harm.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:29:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>We searched widely for evidence using 11 citation databases and using search terms to help identify as wide a range of interventions as possible. We found some notable gaps in the evidence. We did not identify any RCTs evaluating a complementary therapy or alternative medicine, despite trials of these interventions, such as <I>Ginkgo biloba</I>, being tested in other populations. However, a limitation is that we did not search foreign language databases, therefore we may have missed some studies, for example Chinese herbal medicines and acupuncture. In any further update we recommend that these need to be considered.</P>
<P>We also identified no completed trials of interventions that were evaluated in populations with cancers other than breast or gynaecological cancer. However, one of the trials in progress is assessing an intervention following treatment for rectal or anal cancer. This is an important omission as colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the treatment, such as surgery and radiation, is likely to affect sexual function (<LINK REF="REF-Donovan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 2010</LINK>). Moreover, it is known that head and neck cancer survivors struggle with disfigurement and changes in body image, and have increased social isolation, all of which may lead to sexual difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Low-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2008</LINK>). Another limitation is that all trials were undertaken in advanced western societies, with the majority being undertaken in US populations. Therefore our findings may not be applicable to other populations, in particular where cultural practices in regards to sexual matters may be different.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:29:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>We could not adequately assess risk of bias in that we found all trials to have at least one methodological item under-reported, including blinding or randomisation sequence generation. The quality of the evidence is also weakened as eight of the trials had samples of fewer than 50 participants per trial arm. Some of these were also pilot studies, the focus of which was on feasibility rather than effectiveness.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-25 14:48:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>We undertook a comprehensive search of 11 databases; the last search was completed in September 2015. More recently published eligible studies will be captured at the next update. We identified seven potentially eligible studies in progress from trial registers and conference abstracts. In further updates of this review we recommend consideration of searching foreign language databases.</P>
<P>At least two authors undertook all steps of this review. This limited the risk of errors in determining study eligibility, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data synthesis.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:30:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>There are two recent relevant systematic reviews of psychotherapy in general populations. Both are non-Cochrane reviews evaluating psychotherapeutic interventions in both men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Berner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fruhauf-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fruhauf 2013</LINK>). The review by <LINK REF="REF-Berner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berner 2012</LINK> included 20 trials but only two of these included women with sexual dysfunction. They found no benefit of the interventions for women. The review by <LINK REF="REF-Fruhauf-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fruhauf 2013</LINK> included 34 trials that compared the psychosocial intervention with a comparison group. They found in combined analysis of five trials an improvement in sexual function in those who received sexual skills training. However, it is important to note that these reviews were undertaken in non-cancer populations and therefore their findings are not necessarily transferable to the populations considered in our review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:30:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>This update found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of topical pharmacological treatments, psychotherapeutic interventions and pelvic floor exercises. Apart from the pharmacological treatment we found limited evaluations of any potential harms these interventions may incur.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-22 12:30:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Improved diagnosis and treatments for cancer mean that more people will be living with and surviving cancer, and of these a significant proportion may have sexual dysfunction. Further evidence is needed on treatments for sexual dysfunction from high-quality trials with large samples that fully report key methodological characteristics and harms. It is difficult to suggest which interventions might be most useful for further evaluation, as the trials we evaluated were at risk of biased results. Across the trials there was also minimal overlap in how the intervention was evaluated. Future trials need to consider preparatory stages in intervention development, to increase appropriateness and need, such as in the case of psychotherapeutic interventions, for example those recommended in the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines on developing and evaluating complex interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>). They also need to fully report details of the intervention. Consideration is also needed of the choice of outcome measures that are appropriate to the patient population and the nature of the intervention, such as measures of sexual function, quality of life and mental health.</P>
<P>The trials evaluated in this review varied in design; some included a comparative arm with no additional support for sexual dysfunction and others compared the intervention arm with an active control. Future research should consider the appropriateness of a control group that is given no support despite sexual dysfunction. Perhaps at the very least trialists should consider using a comparative arm for which the provision of usual care for sexual dysfunction is provided.</P>
<P>Sexual dysfunction is difficult to treat in this population as it may result from multiple causes, not all of which are a direct outcome of the cancer treatment. These causes include the emotional stress of having the diagnosis and its impact on daily living, as well as natural aging. Thus it may be a particularly difficult disorder to treat.</P>

<P>This review is an update of an earlier review that included interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer in both women and men (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2007</LINK>). This review only includes interventions for treating sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer in women. All sections have been revised to reflect the patient group. The inclusion criteria for sexual dysfunction have been amended, to make it clear what is eligible. More detail is also provided on outcomes of interest.</P>

<P>Intervention directed at the patient</P>
<P>Aim: the efficacy of a trial of an Internet-based intervention for cancer-related female sexual dysfunction with the support of 3 counselling sessions compared to when the website is used as a self help site</P>
<P>Intervention: website with sections describing the sexual and fertility consequences of their cancer and treatment, an interactive vulva self portrait with pain and pleasure mapping, sex after menopause; management of vaginal dryness and pain; causes and treatment options for loss of desire or orgasm problems; resuming sex. It also involved videos of women cancer survivors and vignettes played by actors illustrating common problems and coping strategies. A therapist manual provided guidance and content checklists during 3 counselling sessions. These were provided by 2 masters level mental health professionals. The counsellors guided women through the website and discussed behavioural homework.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Electronic database search terms as used in 2015 update</HEADING>
<P>The search terms used reflected the three components to our research question:</P>
<UL>
<LI>interventions for SD;</LI>
<LI>SD variants;</LI>
<LI>treatments for cancer.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The search terms are for both men and women; this is because initially we planned to include interventions for both sexes in one review. The findings were only split when it became apparent that the number of trials would prevent timely completion of a review covering both interventions for men and for women.</P>
