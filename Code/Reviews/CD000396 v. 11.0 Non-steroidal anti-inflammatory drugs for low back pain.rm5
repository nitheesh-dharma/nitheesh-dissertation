<TITLE>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low-back pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-11 12:54:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are commonly used for treating low-back pain. This review found 65 studies (including over 11,000 patients) of mixed methodological quality that compared various NSAIDs with placebo (an inactive substance that has no treatment value), other drugs, other therapies and with other NSAIDs. The review authors conclude that NSAIDs are slightly effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica (pain and tingling radiating down the leg). In patients with acute sciatica, no difference in effect between NSAIDs and placebo was found.</P>
<P>The review authors also found that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs (paracetamol/acetaminophen, narcotic analgesics, and muscle relaxants). Placebo and paracetamol/acetaminophen had fewer side effects than NSAIDs, though the latter has fewer side effects than muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics. The new COX-2 NSAIDs do not seem to be more effective than traditional NSAIDs, but are associated with fewer side effects, particularly stomach ulcers. However, other literature has shown that some COX-2 NSAIDs are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.</P>
<P>The review noted a number of limitations in the studies. Only 42% of the studies were considered to be of high quality. Many of the studies had small numbers of patients, which limits the ability to detect differences between the NSAID and the control group. There are few data on long term results and long-term side effects.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low-back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low-back pain. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective was to assess the effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low-back pain with or without sciatica were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All studies were also assessed on clinical relevance, from which no further interpretations or conclusions were drawn. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed. If data were lacking for clinically homogeneous trials, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no evidence). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low-back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low-back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects than traditional NSAIDs. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs in the RCTs included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-11 13:17:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Low-back pain is a major health problem among populations in western industrialized countries and a major cause of medical expenses, absenteeism and disablement (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1995</LINK>). Although low-back pain is usually a benign and self-limiting disease which tends to improve spontaneously over time (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1987</LINK>), a wide variety of therapeutic interventions is available for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). However, the effectiveness of most of these interventions has not yet been demonstrated beyond doubt and consequently, the therapeutic management of low-back pain varies widely. A major challenge for researchers is to provide evidence of which treatment, if any, is of most benefit for (sub-groups of) patients with low-back pain. </P>
<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low-back pain. The rationale for the treatment of low-back pain with NSAIDs is based both on their analgesic potential and their anti-inflammatory action. </P>
<P>Guidelines for the management of low-back pain in primary care have been published in various countries around the world (<LINK REF="REF-Airaksinen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airaksinen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2006</LINK>). All these guidelines recommend the prescription of NSAIDs as one option for symptomatic relief in the management of low-back pain. In most guidelines, NSAIDs are recommended as a treatment option after paracetamol has been tried. In addition to symptomatic relief, facilitating early return to normal activities is a goal of NSAID therapy. </P>
<P>In recent years, the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibiting NSAIDs have become available as an alternative to traditional NSAIDs. The putative advantage of the COX-2 inhibitors is lower risk of gastro-intestinal side effects as compared with the traditional NSAIDs. However, recently there has been substantial debate on their cardiovascular safety. A few randomised clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of selective COX-2 inhibitors for low-back pain and will be included in this updated systematic review. <BR/> </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine if NSAIDs are more efficacious than various comparison treatments for non-specific low-back pain and if so, which type of NSAID is most efficacious. </P>
<P>Comparisons of NSAIDs with reference treatments that were investigated are NSAIDs versus placebo, NSAIDs versus acetaminophen/paracetamol, NSAIDs versus other drugs (e.g. narcotic analgesics or muscle relaxants), NSAIDs versus NSAIDs (e.g. traditional NSAIDs versus selective COX-2 inhibitors), NSAIDs versus NSAIDs plus muscle relaxant, NSAIDs versus NSAIDs plus B vitamins, and NSAIDs versus non-drug treatment. </P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised trials (double-blind, single-blind and open-label) and double-blind controlled trials were included. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Subjects age 18 years or older, treated for non-specific low-back pain with or without sciatica, were included. Subjects with specific low-back pain caused by pathological entities such as infection, neoplasm, metastasis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or fractures were excluded. Both acute (12 weeks or less) and chronic (more than 12 weeks) low-back pain patients were included. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>One or more types of NSAIDs were included. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a contrast for NSAIDs in the study. For example, studies comparing NSAIDs plus muscle relaxants versus muscle relaxants alone were included, while studies comparing NSAIDs plus muscle relaxants versus paracetamol were not. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome measures were (in hierarchical order): 1) pain intensity (e.g. Visual Analog Scale or Numerical Rating Scale), 2) global measure (e.g. overall improvement, proportion of patients recovered), 3) back pain-specific functional status (e.g. Roland Disability Questionnaire, Oswestry Scale), 4) return to work (e.g. return to work status, number of days off work), and 5) side effects (proportion of patients experiencing side effects). Physiological outcomes (e.g. range of motion, spinal flexibility, degrees of straight leg raising or muscle strength) and generic functional status (e.g. SF-36, Nottingham Health Profile, Sickness Impact Profile) were considered secondary outcomes. Other symptoms such as health care consumption were also considered. </P>

<P>All relevant RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria were identified by:<BR/>A) a computer-aided search of the MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 2007) and EMBASE (from 1988 to June 2007) databases using the search strategy recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). RCTs published in English, Dutch and German were included because the review authors who conducted the methodological quality assessment and data extraction were able to read papers published in these languages.<BR/>B) a search in CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2007, issue 2.<BR/>C) screening references given in relevant reviews and identified RCTs.</P>
<P>The intervention specific search contained MeSH-headings (explode 'anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroidal') and textwords in title, keywords and abstracts ('nsaid', 'non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug').

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodologic quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The criteria list recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) was used for assessing the methodological quality of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). All items were scored as positive or negative. Unclear scores were not included, because we had decided not to contact the authors for additional information.</P>
<P>The methodologic quality of the RCTs was independently assessed by two review authors. Consensus was used to resolve disagreements and a third review author was consulted if disagreements persisted. If the article did not contain information on the methodologic criteria, these criteria were scored as 'negative'. Because 31 of the 64 studies included in this review were published before 1990, we decided not to contact the authors for additional information.</P>
<P>We defined high quality studies as RCTs which fulfilled six or more of the validity criteria, but also performed sensitivity analyses exploring the results when high quality was defined as fulfilling five or more or seven or more of the 11 validity criteria. We also explored the results if high quality was defined as having adequate concealment of treatment allocation. Analyses were performed separately for traditional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 NSAIDs, (sub)acute low-back pain (12 weeks or less) and chronic low-back pain (more than 12 weeks), short-term follow-up (less than six months after randomization) and long-term follow-up (six months or more), and low-back pain with and without sciatica.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted the data (using a standardized form). Data were extracted on type and dose of NSAIDs, type of reference treatment, follow-up, presence or absence of sciatica, duration of current symptoms, and the outcomes described above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>The quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) was limited to clinically homogeneous studies for which the study populations, interventions and outcomes were considered by the review authors to be similar (see comparisons). We included a test for homogeneity of the Relative Risk (RR) of the RCTs. If studies were clinically and statistically homogeneous, Mean Differences, RRs and 95% CI were presented using the fixed-effect model. If studies were clinically homogeneous but statistically heterogeneous, the random-effects model was used. For Mean Differences, the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) was presented if all studies reported an identical scale for an outcome measure (e.g. 100 mm VAS for Pain Intensity); otherwise the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was presented (e.g. 100 mm VAS and 5-point scale for Pain Intensity).</P>
<P>A qualitative analysis was performed if relevant data enabling statistical pooling were lacking. In the qualitative analysis, a rating system of levels of evidence was used to summarize the results of the studies in terms of strength of the scientific evidence. The rating system consisted of four levels of scientific evidence based on the quality and the outcome of the studies:<BR/>- <B>Strong evidence </B>- consistent findings among multiple high quality RCTs<BR/>- <B>Moderate evidence</B> - consistent findings among multiple low quality RCTs and/or one high quality RCT<BR/>- <B>Limited evidence</B> - one low quality RCT<BR/>- <B>Conflicting evidence</B> - inconsistent findings among multiple RCTs<BR/>- <B>No evidence from trials</B> - no RCTs or CCTs</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The updated search resulted in 125 additional references from MEDLINE, 566 from EMBASE and 55 from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. After filtering for duplicates, 467 references were left for assessment. During the first selection based on titles, keywords and abstracts, the two review authors agreed that 23 articles should be included, they were uncertain about five studies and rejected 439 studies. Assessment of the 28 full papers resulted in four more studies being rejected. One study reported on two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2001</LINK>) and therefore this reference is listed twice. Six studies that had been included earlier in the review were also rejected, as two of these papers only described the onset of pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Veenema-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veenema 2000</LINK>), and four papers did not meet language criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kittang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kittang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natour-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Natour 2002</LINK>).

<P>Consequently, 15 new studies were included. </P>
<P>The previous search had resulted in 53 selected studies for this review. Three of these studies were excluded, one of them because the efficacy of a muscle relaxant instead of an NSAID was evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1988b</LINK>), the second only investigated different dosage regimes of the same NSAID (<LINK REF="STD-Pownall-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pownall 1985</LINK>) and the third because the study population consisted of back and neck pain patients (<LINK REF="STD-Coletta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Coletta 1988</LINK>). </P>

<P>Potential explanations for this heterogeneity were explored. The meta-analysis was split into studies reporting on low-back pain without sciatica or a mixed population and studies reporting on low-back pain with sciatica only. the studies that reported on non-sciatic/mixed acute low-back pain were statistically homogeneous (Chi-square 3.47; P &gt; 0.1), and using the fixed-effect model, the pooled WMD was -8.39 (95% CI -12.68 to -4.10), indicating a statistically significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo (graph 01.01). The sciatica-only studies were still heterogeneous (Chi-square 7.25; P &lt; 0.01) and there was no statistical difference in effect between NSAIDs and placebo (WMD -0.16; 95% CI -11.92 to 11.52).</P>
<P>Seven of the eleven studies which compared NSAIDs with placebo for acute low-back pain reported dichotomous data on global improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Basmajian-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Basmajian 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldie-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Goldie 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szpalski-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Szpalski 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1980</LINK>).

<P>Six studies, one high quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Hickey-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hickey 1982</LINK>) and five low quality studies (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muckle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Muckle 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesel 1980</LINK>), compared some type of NSAID with paracetamol or acetaminophen. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are equally effective for pain relief and global improvement compared with paracetamol for acute low-back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesel 1980</LINK>); pooled SMD -0.21 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.02; N = 309); pooled RR 1.23 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.73; N = 128) (<LINK REF="STD-Hickey-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hickey 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milgrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Milgrom 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Muckle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Muckle 1986</LINK>) (graphs 03.01 and 03.02). One low quality study in a mixed population of acute and chronic low-back pain patients also found no differences (<LINK REF="STD-Muckle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Muckle 1986</LINK>). One high quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Hickey-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hickey 1982</LINK>) found limited evidence that NSAIDs are more effective for pain relief than paracetamol in patients with chronic low-back pain.</P>
<P>NSAIDs were associated with more side effects compared to paracetamol (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.76, N = 309) (graph 03.03).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs versus other drugs</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basmajian-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Basmajian 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braun-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Braun 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chrubasik-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chrubasik 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingpen-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Ingpen 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metscher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Metscher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sweetman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sweetman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Videman-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Videman 1984a</LINK>) were identified that compared NSAIDs with some other kind of drug. Two of these studies were considered to be of high methodologic quality (<LINK REF="STD-Chrubasik-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chrubasik 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Videman-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Videman 1984a</LINK>). Seven studies reported on acute low-back pain, five of which, including one high quality study, did not find any statistical differences between NSAIDs and narcotic analgesics or muscle relaxants (<LINK REF="STD-Basmajian-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Basmajian 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braun-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Braun 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sweetman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sweetman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Videman-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Videman 1984a</LINK>). Because of clinical heterogeneity, the pooled RR was not estimated (graph 04.01). There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain.</P>
<P>For chronic low-back pain, one high quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Chrubasik-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chrubasik 2003</LINK>) reported equal effectiveness for an NSAID (doloteffin) compared to a herbal medicine (Harpagophytum procumbens).</P>
<P>One study did not specify if patients with acute and/or chronic low-back pain were included and data extraction was not possible from this study (<LINK REF="STD-Ingpen-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Ingpen 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>Side effects are plotted in Graph 04.02.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs versus non-drug treatments</HEADING>
<P>Four low quality studies were identified comparing NSAIDs with non-drug treatments such as spinal manipulation, physiotherapy and bed rest. There is conflicting evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than bed rest for acute low-back pain, as one study (<LINK REF="STD-Szpalski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Szpalski 1990</LINK>) reported a positive outcome and one study did not find a significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Postacchini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Postacchini 1988</LINK>). However, the latter study also showed a larger improvement in the NSAID group, and the small number in the bed rest group (N = 29) may have caused a lack of power to detect a statistically significant difference. Two studies found no differences between NSAIDs and physiotherapy or spinal manipulation in acute low-back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Postacchini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Postacchini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waterworth-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Waterworth 1985</LINK>), therefore, there is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than physiotherapy or spinal manipulation for acute low-back pain. One study may have lacked power because of the small groups (<LINK REF="STD-Waterworth-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Waterworth 1985</LINK>). One low quality study comparing NSAIDs to a heat-wrap for patients with acute low-back pain, found a statistically significant difference in favour of the heat-wrap. So, there is limited evidence that NSAIDs are less effective than a heat-wrap for acute low-back pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of different types of NSAIDs</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-three trials compared at least two or more different types of NSAIDs. Two trials compared two types of NSAIDs (diclofenac versus dipyrone and diclofenac versus etofenamat, respectively) administered by intramuscular injection (<LINK REF="STD-Babej_x002d_Dolle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Babej-Dolle 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stratz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stratz 1990</LINK>). One compared intramuscular diclofenac with intravenous meloxicam (<LINK REF="STD-Colberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colberg 1996</LINK>), one compared an intramuscular injection of tenoxicam with tenoxicam tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Listrat-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Listrat 1990</LINK>), one compared ibuprofen tablets with felbinac foam (<LINK REF="STD-Hosie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hosie 1993</LINK>), and one compared diclofenac gel with indomethacin plaster (<LINK REF="STD-Waikakul-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Waikakul 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study reported on acute and chronic low-back pain separately, and consequently a total of 20 studies included acute low-back pain patients, four chronic low-back pain patients, and eight an unspecified or mixed population of acute and chronic low-back pain patients.</P>
<P>Six studies on acute low-back pain reported differences between the NSAIDs and fifteen found no differences. Eleven studies on acute low-back pain were of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Babej_x002d_Dolle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Babej-Dolle 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bakshi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bakshi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blazek-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Blazek 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orava-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Orava 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohjolainen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pohjolainen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schattenkirchner2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schattenkirchner2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ximenes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ximenes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yakhno-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yakhno 2006</LINK>). One of the high quality studies compared two types of NSAIDs administered by intramuscular injection and reported better results for dipyrone compared to diclofenac (<LINK REF="STD-Babej_x002d_Dolle-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Babej-Dolle 1994</LINK>). None of the other high quality studies evaluating NSAIDs capsules found any differences.</P>
<P>There seems to be no difference in the reported number and severity of side effects for the various types of NSAIDs. Only three low quality studies reported statistically significant differences in side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Agrifoglio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Agrifoglio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famaey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Famaey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hingorani-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Hingorani 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although 33 studies compared different types of NSAIDs, it was only possible to state that there is moderate evidence based on two trials that the relative effectiveness of meloxicam is equal to diclofenac for acute low-back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Colberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2001b</LINK>). None of the other studies compared the same two NSAIDs for acute or chronic low-back pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">COX-2 NSAIDs versus traditional NSAIDs</HEADING>
<P>Five studies compared COX-2 NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs (meloxicam versus diclofenac (<LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2001b</LINK>); nimesulide versus diclofenac (<LINK REF="STD-Famaey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Famaey 1998</LINK>); nimesulide versus ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Pohjolainen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pohjolainen 2000</LINK>); valdecoxib versus diclofenac (<LINK REF="STD-Ximenes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ximenes 2007</LINK>); etoricoxib versus diclofenac (<LINK REF="STD-Zerbini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zerbini 2005</LINK>)). Statistical pooling of three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dreiser-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Dreiser 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohjolainen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pohjolainen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ximenes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ximenes 2007</LINK>) found no statistically significant differences for pain relief for acute low-back pain (graph 05.01). The fourth study showed similar results.</P>
<P>The fifth, a high quality study, found moderate evidence that there were no differences in pain relief between COX-2 and traditional NSAIDs for chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Zerbini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zerbini 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects (RR 0.83 ; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99) (graphs 05.02, 05.03, 05.04).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs versus NSAIDs plus muscle relaxants</HEADING>
<P>Three studies, one high quality and two low quality RCTs, compared some type of NSAID with NSAIDs plus muscle relaxants for acute low-back pain. In all three studies, the authors reported the combination of an NSAID with a muscle relaxant to be better than the NSAID alone, although there were no statistically significant differences. In two trials, side effects were more frequent in the combination groups (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borenstein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Borenstein 1990</LINK>). The review authors concluded that no differences were shown in any of the three trials and therefore, there is moderate evidence that muscle relaxants do not provide any additional effect to NSAIDs alone for acute low-back pain.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs versus NSAIDs plus B vitamins</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared diclofenac with the addition of B vitamins for low-back pain, two of which were high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhlwein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhlwein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1988</LINK>). All three studies were published in German.

The authors of all three studies reported positive results for the combination therapy, although there were no statistically significant differences reported in two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggemann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggemann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1988</LINK>). The review authors concluded that there is conflicting evidence that an NSAID (diclofenac) plus B vitamins are more effective than diclofenac alone for acute low-back pain, and limited evidence that B vitamins do not provide additional effect to an NSAID for chronic degenerative low-back pain.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-11 12:56:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>The results of the 65 RCTs which were included in this review suggest that NSAIDs are slightly effective for short-term global improvement in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica.</P>
<P>The placebo-controlled studies suggest that NSAIDs are effective in improving global improvement in patients with acute low-back pain, but effects are only small. Quantitative analysis, in which the results of individual RCTs were statistically pooled, indicate statistically significant effects in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for populations with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. Besides the effectiveness of NSAIDs compared to placebo, the NSAIDs group with acute low-back pain used less additional analgesics, but there was a statistically significantly higher number of patients with side-effects in the NSAIDs group.</P>
<P>The studies regarding chronic low-back pain also showed statistically significantly more side-effects in the NSAIDs group compared with placebo. In addition, in all newly added studies assessing NSAIDs for chronic low-back pain, a so called "flare design" was used, in which patients who were already responding well to NSAIDs are only included when they show a large worsening in low-back pain complaints during a wash-out period. This may have caused favourable results of the investigated NSAIDs, expressed in an overestimation of the effects and an underestimation of the side-effects due to the selection of the study population, and certainly decreases the external validity for daily practice.</P>
<P>Whether NSAIDs are more effective than other drugs or non-drug therapies for acute low-back pain still remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than simple analgesics or bed rest, and moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs, physiotherapy or spinal manipulation for acute low-back pain. NSAIDs in combination with muscle relaxants or B vitamins do not seem to provide more benefits than NSAIDs alone. However, except for the B vitamin studies, the group sizes in these studies were smaller than 65 and therefore, these studies simply may have lacked power to detect a statistically significant difference. Sample size calculations have shown that 65 patients are needed per group to detect a clinically relevant difference of 25% with a power of 0.80 and an alpha of 0.05. There is little evidence on the most effective way of administration, i.e. intramuscular injections, capsules or a combination of both, or gel, as only a few studies evaluated injections or gel.</P>
<P>There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs are equally effective for acute low-back pain.</P>
<P>The efficacy of NSAIDS for patients with sciatica has not been shown in the studies included in this review. Even compared to placebo, the favourable effects of NSAIDs could not be demonstrated in this important subgroup of patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>There is no clear difference in the reported number or severity of side-effects between the different types of NSAIDs in the studies included in this review. Numerous articles have reported on the side-effects of NSAIDs, especially gastrointestinal events. In the studies presented in this review, side-effects were also frequently reported, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, rash, dizziness, headache, tiredness, etc. According to the authors of the studies, most side-effects were considered to be mild to moderately severe. However, the sample sizes of most of the studies were relatively small and therefore, no clear conclusion can be drawn from these studies regarding the risks for gastrointestinal and other side effects of NSAIDs. Statistical pooling of all side effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo for acute low-back pain indeed showed an increased RR, indicating the additional risk of using NSAIDs. The comparison of several COX-2 selective NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs showed a decreased RR of side-effects associated with COX-2 NSAIDs but more extended analyses of the separate risks of upper and lower gastrointestinal side-effects and central nervous system side effects are needed. In this respect, the recent insights and debate on the increased risk for cardiovascular events associated with the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors are of importance. These increased risks of COX-2 NSAIDs (as compared with placebo) have been shown in large randomized clinical trials. These finding have lead to the removal of some selective COX-2 inhibitors from the market. The current question is whether the increased risk holds for all selective COX-2 inhibitors and perhaps for the traditional NSAIDs as well. But in order to validly answer this question, more valid data are needed from large epidemiologic studies of NSAID side effects. These data should also consider the dose, frequency and duration of the NSAID intake. It might well be, that in the majority of patients with low-back pain, the intake is of short duration and might not reach the level associated with increased cardiovascular risks.</P>
<P>Henry (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1996</LINK>) reported the results of a meta-analysis of controlled epidemiological studies on the relative risks of serious gastrointestinal complications due to NSAIDs. The authors concluded that ibuprofen was associated with the lowest relative risk of serious gastrointestinal complications. However, this was mainly attributable to the low doses of ibuprofen used in clinical practice. Because there are no important differences in efficacy between the different types of NSAIDs, <LINK REF="REF-Henry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1996</LINK> recommended using the lowest effective doses of drugs that seem to be associated with a comparatively low risk of serious gastrointestinal complications.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>This review shows that many RCTs examining the efficacy of NSAIDs in low-back pain have methodological shortcomings. The randomization procedure was not described in most studies, making it impossible for the reader of the article to determine whether adequate procedures were used to exclude bias. In many studies, no measures were taken in the study design to avoid co-interventions, so it remains unclear if a reported difference of effect was due to the NSAID alone, or to a co-intervention (vice versa, if there was no difference in effect, this may be due to co-interventions in the control group). Compliance was often not measured and reported or was not satisfactory, leaving it uncertain if the prescribed medication was actually taken and leaving it unclear if the effect (or lack of effect) was due to the prescribed regimen. The length of follow-up was considered inadequate in more than half of the trials, because there was no long-term follow-up. Since international guidelines set prevention of disability as one of the main goals of early management and NSAIDs play a role in establishing this goal, one would be interested to know if NSAIDs also have any long-term benefits. In post hoc sensitivity analyses, we repeated the meta-analyses without the low quality studies, but these did not alter the direction of any of the conclusions.</P>
<P>Although not related to the internal validity or methodological quality of the RCTs, the small size of the study populations in many RCTs indicates that these studies may lack statistical power to detect clinically relevant differences in effects. Statistical pooling may be a way to overcome this problem, but as was shown in this review, pooling is not always feasible. Smaller sample sizes may also lead to an imbalance of important prognostic factors between the study groups after randomisation, which may lead to biased outcomes if, by chance, patients in one group had a more favourable prognosis.</P>
<P>The reported methodologic flaws are not unique for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs, but have been reported to be a general problem in low-back pain trials (<LINK REF="REF-Koes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 1995</LINK>). On average, trials of drug therapy for low-back pain even have a higher methodologic quality than non-drug trials (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). However, there is still a need to improve the development, conduct and reporting of RCTs in the field of back pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the study</HEADING>
<P>It is possible that the effectiveness of NSAIDs is overestimated in this review because of publication bias. The language criteria we used for including studies in this review might even have enlarged this risk, as positive results are more likely to be published in English. However we were not able to estimate the impact it might have had on our results, as the number of studies per comparison was small.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence from the 65 RCTs included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term global improvement in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica, although the effects are small. It is still unclear if NSAIDs are more effective than simple analgesics and other drugs. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others, nor is there any evidence to recommend another route of administration besides oral capsules or tablets. NSAIDs plus muscle relaxants or B vitamins do not seem to be more effective than NSAIDs alone. For patients with sciatica, there is no evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for RCTs, which meet the current high methodological standards, to evaluate the effectiveness of NSAIDs for treating patients with acute low-back pain with sciatica and for treating patients with chronic low-back pain with sciatica. It also seems useful to evaluate the most effective dose with the comparatively lowest risk of (serious) side effects. </P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low back pain is an important medical problem in Western industrialised countries. NSAIDs are one of the main options for symptomatic pain relief in the early management of this painful condition. Dexketoprofen is an NSAID belonging to the arylpropionic acid group that has demonstrated good analgesic efficacy and a good safety profile in different acute and chronic painful conditions. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, parallel, active controlled, multicentre study that included 370 outpatients with acute low back pain was conducted to compare the analgesic efficacy of dexketoprofen 50mg twice daily versus diclofenac 75mg twice daily administered intramuscularly for 2 days. Efficacy outcomes were assessment of pain intensity (PI) measured on a visual analogue scale, total PI scores from baseline to 6 hours after the first-dose administration (primary efficacy endpoint; SAPID(0-6)), score on a physical disability scale using the Roland Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), and use of rescue medication. Tolerability and safety were also assessed as secondary variables. RESULTS: The adjusted mean (SAPID(0-6)) scores were very similar, 117.3 mm/h with dexketoprofen and 114.7 mm/h with diclofenac. The adjusted ratio of means was 1.023 and the lower 95% confidence limit was 0.81, demonstrating non-inferiority of dexketoprofen (defined by a lower limit of the 95% CI &amp;gt;0.80) in comparison with diclofenac (per-protocol analysis). The median change in the RDQ was -6 points for both groups (p = 0.69), showing an overall improvement on the disability scale. No significant differences between groups were observed regarding the percentage of patients needing rescue medication or in the mean values of pain after repeated doses (SAPID(0-last)). Dexketoprofen was well tolerated, with a reported incidence of adverse events similar to that of diclofenac. No serious adverse events were reported in either treatment group. CONCLUSION: From the results of this study it can be concluded that dexketoprofen 50mg administered twice daily intramuscularly provides a clinically relevant analgesic effect with good tolerability after single and repeated doses in patients with acute severe low back pain&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>A. Was the method of randomisation adequate?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer-generated random numbers table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>B. Was the treatment allocation concealed?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>C. Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In order to receive a "yes," groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>D. Was the patient blinded to the intervention?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>E. Was the care provider blinded to the intervention?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>F. Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>G. Were co-interventions avoided or similar?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or be similar between the index and control groups.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>H. Was the compliance acceptable in all groups?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The review author determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>I. Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for immediate and short-term follow-ups, 30% for intermediate and long-term follow-ups and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>J. Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>K. Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values), irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions.</P>

<TITLE>Inaccuracies in NSAIDs for low back pain review</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>please note that these comments refer to the 2002(2) version of the review. A substantial update is being published in The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 1 which should address the concerned outlined below (VEP, Managing Editor)</P>
<P>In the course of reviewing this review the commentator noted a number of problems. His intention was to feed them back to help improve the review. </P>
<P>According to the commentator, the problems were the following:<BR/>1. He stated that verifying the conclusions by looking directly at the results of the included studies was difficult. The actual results are helpfully given in the characteristics of included studies table. It would be helpful if this table could be sub-divided according to the conditions (acute or chronic LBP) and comparator (placebo, other NSAID, other treatments) i.e. grouped according to the sub-categories by which the review author report the results.<BR/>2. He indicated there are some discrepancies between the numerical results in the table of included characteristics and the Forest plots.<BR/>3. He also reports there are some instances where the results for the control have been entered for the experimental group and vice versa.<BR/>4. The "favours" labels at the bottom of the Forest plot for the outcome of numbers needing additional analgesia are the wrong way round. An OR &gt; 1 favours the control for this outcome, not NSAID.<BR/>5. He feels that care needs to be taken in using the summary OR from the meta-analysis to indicate the overall impact on pain and analgesic use in placebo controlled trials for acute LBP when only 3 of the 9 included studies contribute, without indicating that the other six did not measure these outcomes (which he doubts).</P>
<P>He states, "Basically I'm afraid that there needs to be a careful re-run of the data abstraction and analysis. "</P>
