<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of severe vision loss in people 55 years and older. Neovascular AMD, which involves abnormal growth of blood vessels in the back of the eye, accounts for most AMD-related severe vision loss. Injections into the eye of medications, such as pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab, that block this abnormal growth of blood vessels in the back of the eye are the main way to treat this condition. These types of medications are known as anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs).</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We aimed to investigate: (1) the effects of anti-VEGF agents injected into the eye for the treatment of neovascular AMD when compared with no anti-VEGF treatment; and (2) the relative effects of one anti-VEGF agent compared with another when administered in comparable dosages and regimens.</P>
<P>
<B>Study details</B>
<BR/>We found 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included a total of 5496 participants with neovascular AMD (the number of participants per trial ranged from 28 to 1208). One trial compared pegaptanib, three trials ranibizumab, and two trials bevacizumab versus no anti-VEGF treatment; six trials compared bevacizumab with ranibizumab. Four trials were conducted by drug companies; none of the eight studies which evaluated bevacizumab were funded by drug companies. The trials were conducted at various centers on five continents (North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia). All trials treated and followed-up participants for at least one year. The evidence is current to 27 March 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Participants treated with any of the three anti-VEGF agents more often experienced improved vision, less often lost vision, and were less likely to be legally blind than participants treated with control interventions after one year of treatment. Participants treated with anti-VEGF agents also showed improvements in structural areas of the eye that doctors use to monitor disease progression and treatment response compared with participants not treated with anti-VEGF agents.</P>
<P>Compared with control treatments, treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab yielded larger improvements than pegaptanib. No trial compared pegaptanib directly with other anti-VEGF agents. When bevacizumab and ranibizumab were compared with each other, there were no major differences with respect to vision-related outcomes; there was, however, a large difference in cost between the two agents.</P>
<P>Inflammation and increased pressure in the eye were the most common vision-related adverse events with anti-VEGF agents. Endophthalmitis (inflammation in the inner part of the eye, which can lead to blindness) was reported in fewer than 1% of anti-VEGF-treated participants; no cases were reported in control groups. The occurrence of serious adverse health effects, such as high blood pressure and internal bleeding, was comparable across anti-VEGF-treated groups and control groups; however, the number of events was small relative to the number of people in the studies making it difficult to detect any meaningful differences between groups. Few data were available for visual function (e.g., reading speed and critical print size), quality of life, and economic outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The overall quality of the evidence was very good, with most trials having an overall low risk of bias (i.e., good methodological quality).</P>

<P>When compared with control treatments, participants who received any of the three anti-VEGF agents were more likely to have gained 15 letters or more of visual acuity, lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity, and had vision 20/200 or better after one year of follow up. Visual acuity outcomes after bevacizumab and ranibizumab were similar when the same regimens were compared in the same RCTs, despite the substantially lower cost for bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab. No trial directly compared pegaptanib with other anti-VEGF agents; however, when compared with controls, ranibizumab or bevacizumab yielded larger improvements in visual acuity outcomes than pegaptanib.</P>
<P>Participants treated with anti-VEGFs showed improvements in morphologic outcomes (e.g., size of CNV or central retinal thickness) compared with participants not treated with anti-VEGF agents. There was less reduction in central retinal thickness among bevacizumab-treated participants than among ranibizumab-treated participants after one year (MD -13.97 &#956;m; 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.52 to -1.41); however, this difference is within the range of measurement error and we did not interpret it as being clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>Ocular inflammation and increased intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection were the most frequently reported serious ocular adverse events. Endophthalmitis was reported in fewer than 1% of anti-VEGF treated participants; no cases were reported in control groups.

<P>The results of this review indicate the effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) in terms of maintaining visual acuity; ranibizumab and bevacizumab were also shown to improve visual acuity. The information available on the adverse effects of each medication do not suggest a higher incidence of potentially vision-threatening complications with intravitreal injection compared with control interventions; however, clinical trial sample sizes may not have been sufficient to detect rare safety outcomes. Research evaluating variable dosing regimens with anti-VEGF agents, effects of long-term use, combination therapies (e.g., anti-VEGF treatment plus photodynamic therapy), and other methods of delivering the agents should be incorporated into future Cochrane reviews.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive, degenerative disease of the retina that occurs with increasing frequency with age. There are two major types of AMD, commonly referred to as non-neovascular ('dry') and neovascular ('wet') AMD. The non-neovascular type is characterized by drusen (yellow spots under the retina), pigmentary changes (re-distribution of melanin within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) under the retina and migration of melanin into the retina), and geographic atrophy (loss of the RPE and choriocapillaris).</P>
<P>This review concerns neovascular AMD and its treatment. The hallmark of neovascular AMD is choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Breaks in the RPE and Bruch&#8217;s membrane allow naturally occurring vessels in the choroid to grow aberrantly into the subretinal space. These choroidal neovascular vessels typically leak and bleed, causing exudative or hemorrhagic retinal detachments. Without treatment, the process usually evolves into a fibrous scar, which replaces the outer layers of the retina, the RPE, and the choriocapillaris. The scarred retina has greatly diminished visual capacity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>AMD is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the elderly in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bourne-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourne 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bunce-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunce 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghafour-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghafour 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leibowitz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibowitz 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 1994</LINK>). While the non-neovascular type is much more common, the neovascular form of AMD is responsible for most cases of severe vision loss. The incidence of progression from non-neovascular AMD to neovascular AMD is increased by the presence of numerous, large and confluent drusen in the macula as well as by the presence of pigment in the macula. Neovascular AMD occurs in only 10% of people with AMD, yet 80% of those with severe visual loss (worse than 20/200 Snellen acuity) have the neovascular form (<LINK REF="REF-Leibowitz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibowitz 1980</LINK>). Once neovascular disease develops in one eye, the risk of developing neovascular disease in the other eye in the same person is approximately 40% by 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SST-20" TYPE="REFERENCE">SST 20</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall prevalence of AMD, in a meta-analysis of studies from Australia, Europe, and the United States, has been estimated at 1.47% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38% to 1.55%) (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>); however, AMD increases in prevalence with age, with a low incidence among individuals aged less than 50 years. Thus, the burden of disease is greatest in regions where life expectancy is highest. Among those aged 80 years or older, the prevalence of neovascular AMD is estimated to be 5.79% (95% CI 4.72 to 7.01%) in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2003</LINK>) and 8.18% (95% CI 7.07% to 9.29%) in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no consistent evidence that modifiable factors such as lipid levels, blood pressure, light exposure, or alcohol intake put people at greater risk of developing AMD. One notable exception is smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1996</LINK>). Elevated baseline levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein have been found to be associated with the development of early and late AMD in a large population-based cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Boekhoorn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boekhoorn 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, several studies have shown gene-environment interactions of complement factor H with smoking and C-reactive protein (<LINK REF="REF-Deangelis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deangelis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaumberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaumberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seddon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seddon 2006</LINK>). High doses of vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc provide a modest protective effect against the progression to advanced AMD in individuals with extensive drusen or in initially unaffected fellow eyes with neovascular AMD (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS2 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>As the population continues to age, a higher prevalence of this disease is expected in the future, at least in certain populations. A population-based survey estimated AMD, as a contributing cause of blindness, increased worldwide from 4.4% (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in 1990 to 6.6% (95% CI 5.9 to 7.9) in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Bourne-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourne 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Neovascular AMD may affect one eye or both eyes at the same time or sequentially. The symptoms of neovascular AMD are metamorphopsia (distortions while looking at objects), scotomata (black or gray spots), and blurry vision. Depending upon the location of CNV and the vision in the fellow eye, individuals with AMD may be unaware of the change in visual acuity or may note difficulty with performing normal activities that require good central vision, such as reading and writing, watching television, driving and recognizing faces. When AMD affects only one eye, visual loss may go undetected until monocular testing at a routine eye examination or chance occlusion of the better eye. Frequently, people are unaware that their disturbed binocular vision is caused by changes in only one eye.</P>
<P>A diagnosis of neovascular AMD is made clinically and with the help of imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography, which may be necessary to detect subtle exudation in some individuals who have experienced a recent change in visual acuity. At the onset of symptoms, fundus examination often reveals subretinal exudation of fluid, lipid, or blood. OCT, a non-invasive imaging modality, shows cross-sectional images of the retina, RPE, and choroid. Some studies have defined the characteristic appearance of the different stages of the disease process on OCT (<LINK REF="REF-Ting-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ting 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kerckhoven-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kerckhoven 2001</LINK>). The most characteristic findings on OCT corresponding to a CNV lesion include areas of hyporeflectivity under the retina that, in turn, correspond to subretinal fluid, cystic hyporeflective changes consistent with macular edema, and attenuation of the photoreceptor/chorio-capillaris layer. CNV has several characteristic patterns on fluorescein angiography. Classic CNV is defined as an area of early hyperfluorescence with increasing fluorescein leakage on late frames of the angiogram (<LINK REF="REF-MPSG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPSG 1991</LINK>). Occult CNV occurs in two different patterns: fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment and late leakage from an undetermined source. Classic CNV typically has well-demarcated borders, whereas occult CNV usually has poorly demarcated borders.</P>
<P>Another test, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography, may aid in evaluating individuals with neovascular AMD, as it images the choroidal circulation better than fluorescein angiography and may show 'hot' spots under the RPE that are amenable to treatment. ICG angiography is particularly useful in the diagnosis of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a form of AMD most common in Asian populations.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-19 15:42:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until the advent of anti-VEGF agents, treatments most frequently used for neovascular AMD included thermal laser photocoagulation and verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT). A Cochrane systematic review concluded that laser photocoagulation effectively slowed the progression of neovascularization in non-subfoveal lesions compared with observation alone (<LINK REF="REF-Virgili-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virgili 2007</LINK>). A Cochrane review of verteporfin PDT concluded that PDT was effective in preventing clinically significant vision loss (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2007</LINK>). However, neither laser photocoagulation or PDT offered any significant chance for vision improvement.</P>
<P>Over the past two decades, researchers have developed new drugs for the treatment of neovascular AMD. These drugs target a protein in the body known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that stimulates the growth of the abnormal blood vessels in neovascular AMD in a process called angiogenesis; the drugs block VEGF leading to regression of the abnormal blood vessels. Antiangiogenic therapy is the most commonly used treatment for neovascular AMD, particularly subfoveal neovascular lesions.</P>
<P>An example of an anti-VEGF antagonist is pegaptanib (Macugen<SUP>®</SUP>, a trademark of Eyetech/Pfizer, Inc.). Pegaptanib is a chemically synthesized 28-base ribonucleic acid molecule. It is an aptamer (foldable single-strand nucleic acid) and has a capability to change its three-dimensional structure to fit a target protein, in this case VEGF. By binding to VEGF, pegaptanib blocks and inactivates VEGF, thus, halting the process of neovascularization. Pegaptanib was approved for the treatment of neovascular AMD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in December 2004.</P>
<P>Ranibizumab, previously known as rhuFab-VEGF (Lucentis<SUP>®</SUP>, a trademark of Genentech, Inc.), is another example of an anti-VEGF medication developed for ocular administration. It is a humanized antibody fragment capable of binding to the VEGF protein to prevent it from binding to its receptor, thus inhibiting angiogenic activity. Ranibizumab was the first treatment for neovascular AMD that offered a realistic hope for vision improvement; it was approved by the FDA in 2007.</P>
<P>Bevacizumab is another anti-VEGF agent that is used to treat CNV secondary to neovascular AMD. Bevacizumab (Avastin<SUP>®</SUP>, a trademark of Genentech, Inc.) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF. It is the larger parent molecule from which ranibizumab was derived. Bevacizumab is currently approved for the treatment of conditions such as colorectal cancer, but it is widely used by ophthalmologists as an off-label drug for neovascular AMD.</P>
<P>Aflibercept, previously known as VEGF Trap (Eylea<SUP>®</SUP>, a trademark of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), is another anti-VEGF agent; the molecule serves as a VEGF decoy to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels. Aflibercept was approved for the treatment of neovascular AMD by the FDA in 2011. Because its mechanism of action is slightly different than those of the drugs listed above (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) and it was introduced after the protocol for this review was written, we have not evaluated aflibercept in this review.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-19 16:23:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Angiogenesis is a complex process whereby interactions between stimulatory and inhibitory factors result in new blood vessel formation. These factors have been identified in CNV formation in animal models and human tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Aiello-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiello 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kvanta-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvanta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1996</LINK>). Antiangiogenic therapies work either by blocking stimulatory factors or by promoting inhibitory factors, thus disrupting the formation of new vessels. Agents that block the activity of VEGF (anti-VEGFs), a polypeptide with mitogenic effects on endothelial blood vessels, form one type of antiangiogenic therapy. VEGF antagonists have been shown to inhibit CNV in animal models.</P>
<P>In the past, the primary goal of both laser photocoagulation and PDT was to prevent or delay further loss of visual acuity in the treated eye. With the development of agents to counteract VEGF, together known as anti-VEGF agents, the primary goal of the intravitreal injection of these agents is to retain or improve visual acuity. Currently, anti-VEGF agents are administered most commonly via monthly intravitreal injections or as needed after three consecutive monthly injections.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-19 18:17:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The previous version of this Cochrane review documented the effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents in halting the loss of visual acuity in a substantial fraction of treated eyes (<LINK REF="REF-Vedula-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vedula 2008</LINK>). Further, intravitreal injections with ranibizumab led to improvements in vision not previously observed with other AMD treatments. Since this Cochrane review was first published in 2008, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of various anti-VEGF agents, treatment modalities, and combination therapies for the treatment of neovascular AMD (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This review is restricted to: (1) primary RCTs of anti-VEGF agents versus no anti-VEGF treatment; and (2) head-to-head (comparative effectiveness) RCTs of one anti-VEGF agent versus another. Studies of dosage, different treatment strategies, and the combination of anti-VEGF agents with other treatments are outside the scope of this review. The emphasis of this updated review is the stabilization of or improvement in visual acuity with treatment.</P>

<P>Data analysis was guided by Chapter 9 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). The primary outcome and some secondary outcomes for this review related to BCVA in the study eye. We analyzed visual acuity, measured on LogMAR charts, as both dichotomous and continuous outcomes. We calculated the risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. Dichotomous visual acuity outcomes included: proportion of participants who gained 15 letters or more (same as a gain of 3 lines or more) of visual acuity; proportion of participants who lost fewer than 15 letters (same as fewer than 3 lines) of visual acuity; proportion of participants who lost fewer than 30 letters (same as fewer than 6 lines) of visual acuity; proportion of participants not blind (defined as visual acuity better than 20/200); and proportion of participants maintaining visual acuity (same as gain of 0 letters or more). We calculated the mean difference (MD) in mean change of visual acuity from baseline as a continuous visual acuity outcome.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relating to visual function and morphology of CNV also included both dichotomous and continuous outcomes. We calculated RRs with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes and MDs with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Contrast sensitivity outcomes, measured by Pelli-Robson charts, were reported both dichotomously (proportion of participants with a gain of 15 letters or more of contrast sensitivity) and continuously (mean number of letters of contrast sensitivity). We calculated MDs with 95% CIs for near visual acuity and reading speed outcomes when sufficient data were available.</P>
<P>Continuous morphological outcomes included mean change in size of CNV, mean change in size of lesion, and mean change in CRT. We included one dichotomous morphological outcome, which was the resolution of subretinal or intraretinal fluid based on OCT evaluation.</P>
<P>We analyzed quality-of-life scores as continuous outcomes. Because the trials that reported quality-of-life outcomes included in meta-analyses used the same scale, we did not need to calculate standardized mean differences.</P>

Acronyms used to refer to the studies in this review are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two concurrent, randomized trials that used individual participant data meta-analyses under the acronym VISION were identified (<LINK REF="REF-Gragoudas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gragoudas 2004</LINK>), an international trial (<LINK REF="REF-EOP-1003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EOP 1003</LINK>) and a North American trial (<LINK REF="REF-EOP-1004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EOP 1004</LINK>). In the first published version of this review, we assessed the data from these two trials separately and analyzed them according to the original protocol of the review. We obtained the data for the primary and secondary outcomes for the two trials from the information available on the FDA website and by contacting the authors. For this update we considered the two trials as one study, <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>, and collected new data from published articles as available.

<P>For this update, we also refined the eligibility criteria to exclude studies in which anti-VEGF treatment was given in combination with other AMD treatments and to include trials in which two anti-VEGF agents had been compared (i.e., head-to-head trials). Combination therapies for AMD will be covered in a separate Cochrane review. Thus, we did not include the <LINK REF="STD-FOCUS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">FOCUS 2006</LINK> trial, which compared ranibizumab with PDT versus PDT alone and was included in the first version of this review, in this update of the review.</P>
<P>We conducted updated electronic searches in September 2008, April 2011, February 2013, and March 2014. Because we modified the eligibility criteria and new authors joined the review team, we combined all search results and assessed the records as a new review. In all, there were 4827 unique records from electronic searches of bibliographic databases, 403 clinical trial registrations, and 19 additional records identified by the handsearching of conference abstracts (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). From the bibliographic databases, we identified 153 records for full-text review. Of these 153 records, we included 12 RCTs (reported in 108 records) and excluded 39 studies (reported in 45 records).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>This review included a total of 5496 participants from 12 RCTs; the number of participants per trial ranged from 28 to 1208. In all 12 trials, one eye per participant was randomized. The countries in which the trials were conducted spanned the globe: two studies were international (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>), four were conducted in the United States only (<LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>), two each in Austria (<LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>) and the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>), and one each in France (<LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>) and India (<LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>). The 12 trials were similar in that they all enrolled both men and women 50 years of age or older who had subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. Among the included trials, there were variations in the types of eligible neovascular lesions (e.g., predominantly classic CNV, minimally classic CNV, or occult CNV), lesion sizes, and baseline visual acuities of participants. Although the majority of participants in most trials were women, all but one of the enrollees in one trial were men (<LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials predefined visual acuity eligibility criteria for the study eye of each participant. The most common criterion was a BCVA of 20/40 to 20/320 (Snellen equivalent) in the study eye, which was specified in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>). BCVA eligibility ranges included participants with somewhat better visual acuity in the <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK> (20/25 to 20/320), <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK> (20/32 to 20/320), and <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK> (20/320 or better) trials, but potentially worse visual acuity in the <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK> (20/40 to 20/800) and <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK> (20/400 or better) studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>, participants with a BCVA between 35 and 70 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters were eligible; however, the test distance was not reported.</P>
<P>Five trials included only participants with no previous treatment for CNV or AMD (<LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>). The remaining seven trials allowed participants to have received previous therapy for AMD, with certain restrictions as to the type (e.g., verteporfin PDT, intravitreal injections, or surgery), location, and time interval since last treatment. Five trials enrolled participants with either primary or recurrent CNV in the study eye (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>) and one enrolled participants with primary CNV only (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the six studies that reported the type of neovascular lesion, the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> study had the highest proportion of participants with predominantly classic CNV (410/423, 97%). The other five studies had fewer participants with predominantly classic CNV. In the <LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK> study, 25% of 131 participants had predominantly classic CNV; the remaining 75% had either minimally classic or occult CNV. In the <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK> study, 26% of 1208 participants had predominantly classic CNV, 36% had minimally classic CNV, and 38% had occult CNV. The <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> study had similar proportions as the <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK> study, with 19% of 184 participants having predominantly classic CNV, 38% having minimally classic CNV, and 43% having occult CNV at baseline. Forty-four percent of 120 participants had occult CNV in <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>.The <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK> study was limited to participants with only minimally classic or occult CNV and, thus, had the greatest proportion of participants with occult CNV (451/716, 63%).</P>
<P>Two studies that did not report neovascular lesion type described the subfoveal component of the CNV lesion in the study population. In the <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK> study (1208 participants), 58% had CNV in the foveal center, 27% had fluid in the foveal center, 8% had hemorrhage in the foveal center, and 6% had other foveal center involvement. The distribution was similar in the <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK> study (628 participants) in which 54% participants had CNV in the foveal center, 29% had hemorrhage in the foveal center, and 13% had other foveal center involvement. The two smallest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>), with 28 participants in each, and the <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK> (501 participants) and <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK> (321 participants) studies did not describe the type of neovascularization or subfoveal component of the CNV lesion in the study population.</P>
<P>Five trials specified size of the lesion as an inclusion criterion. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>) included participants with lesions of 12 disc areas (DA) or smaller (1 DA = 2.54 mm<SUP>2</SUP>, i.e., standard DA) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>) set 4 DAs as the maximum lesion size.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Comparisons of interventions evaluated in the trials included in this review are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and are summarized here. Among the 12 trials, there were four comparisons of interventions: one study evaluated three doses of pegaptanib versus sham injection (<LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>), three studies compared two doses of ranibizumab with sham injections or PDT (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>), two studies compared bevacizumab with other treatments for AMD (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>), and six studies were head-to-head trials of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab (<LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK> investigators compared sham injections with intravitreal injection of pegaptanib at dosages of 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, or 3.0 mg given every 6 weeks over a 48-week period.</P>
<P>Two different doses of ranibizumab (0.3 mg and 0.5 mg) were evaluated in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>). The control groups and the dosing schedule for ranibizumab differed among the three trials. Monthly intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (for 12 months) was compared with sham intravitreal injections in <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>. For participants assigned to receive sham intravitreal injections in <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>, verteporfin PDT was allowed whenever the CNV lesion in their eyes became predominantly classic CNV. Monthly injection of ranibizumab combined with sham PDT (for 24 months) was compared with verteporfin PDT and sham intravitreal ranibizumab injections in <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>. A regimen of monthly injection of ranibizumab for three months followed by an injection every three months was compared with sham intravitreal injections in <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>Bevacizumab was evaluated in eight trials. In the <LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK> trial, a 1.25 mg dose of bevacizumab was compared with standard therapy. Standard therapy was determined by clinical evaluation and included 0.3 mg pegaptanib, verteporfin PDT, or sham injection. In the small <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK> trial, a 1 mg dose of bevacizumab was compared with verteporfin PDT combined with intravitreal triamcinolone. In six trials, bevacizumab was compared for non-inferiority with ranibizumab. In both <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>, in addition to the primary comparison of the two agents, monthly injections of the anti-VEGF agents were compared with an 'as needed' regimen following three initial injections of the assigned agent. The latter treatment regimen, using a 0.5 mg dose of ranibizumab and a 1.25 mg dose of bevacizumab, was used to compare the two anti-VEGF agents in the <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK> trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of outcome measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>BCVA was the basis of the primary outcome for all the included studies. The primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants who gained 15 letters or more of BCVA at one year of follow up, was the primary outcome for one study (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>) and a secondary outcome for the remaining 11 studies. The proportion of participants losing fewer than 15 letters at one year was the primary outcome for the three earliest studies (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>) and a secondary outcome for the remaining nine studies. The primary outcome was mean change in visual acuity at one year for six studies (<LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>), and the mean change in visual acuity at 18 months for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>). The remaining five studies reported mean change in visual acuity as a secondary outcome. The primary outcome for one study (<LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>) was best-corrected distance visual acuity at two years of follow up; BCVA (as opposed to mean change from baseline) was not an outcome considered in this review.</P>
<P>Other visual acuity outcomes relevant to this review were also reported by some of the included studies. Loss of fewer than 30 letters of visual acuity was reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>); BCVA better than 20/200 was reported for eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>); and maintenance of visual acuity (defined as a gain of 0 letters or more) was reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>). Investigators of included studies reported a number of other visual acuity outcomes that we did not consider in this review.</P>
<P>In all studies, visual acuity was measured using the ETDRS chart, which has a LogMAR scale. Each line on the ETDRS chart consists of 5 letters; thus, a change of 15 letters approximates a 3-line change in visual acuity. The outcome for visual acuity of 20/200 or better was reported as the Snellen equivalent.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Visual function</HEADING>
<P>Visual function outcomes were assessed in five studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK> trial, contrast sensitivity and reading ability were specified as secondary outcomes. In the <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK> trial, contrast sensitivity, near visual acuity, and reading index outcomes were specified as secondary outcomes. We identified one conference abstract in which contrast sensitivity outcomes were reported for the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> trials.</P>
<P>Visual function outcomes were not reported by six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Morphological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All studies included at least one measure relating to the morphological characteristics of neovascular lesions in study eyes. In many cases, sufficient data were not available in publications or conference abstracts to analyze these outcomes informatively. Whenever possible we used data provided by primary investigators or asked primary investigators to confirm data extracted from graphs. We have not reported data derived from graphs in study reports unless confirmation of the data was received from study investigators.</P>
<P>All studies used fluorescein angiography. Fundus photography also was used in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>) and ICG angiography was used in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>). Mean change in the size of CNV was evaluated by fluorescein angiography in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>) and mean change in the size of neovascular lesions was evaluated by fluorescein angiography in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>OCT for the assessment of subretinal characteristics of eyes with neovascular AMD was not used in the earliest study included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>). The next three studies conducted chronologically (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>) used OCT to assess a subset of study participants. In the eight studies most recently conducted (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>), OCT was used in all study participants and at least one OCT measure was specified as a primary or secondary outcome. Mean change in CRT was assessed in the 11 studies that used OCT. We considered central macular thickness, central foveal thickness, and center point thickness to be interchangeable terms for CRT.</P>
<P>Other morphological outcomes, such as area of CNV leakage and subretinal fluid, were reported by individual studies, but we did not include these outcomes in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality-of-life outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Vision-specific quality of life was evaluated in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>) using the 25-item National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). The NEI-VFQ, administered by an interviewer, relies on patient-reported responses to specific visual function questions in order to calculate overall and subscale scores, which can range from 0 to 100, with higher values representing better visual function.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>) evaluated general quality of life using the EuroQoL health-related quality of life assessment (EQ-5D). For the EQ-5D, participant responses to specific health questions are converted to scales of 1 to 3, where 1 represents no health problems, 2 represents moderate health problems, and 3 represents extreme health problems. The scores for each of the five subscale domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) are then summarized into a single index score ranging from -0.59 to 1.00, with 1.00 representing no health problems. Both the NEI-VFQ and EQ-5D are validated tools by which to assess quality-of-life outcomes.</P>
<P>Quality-of-life outcomes were been reported by seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Overall the included studies were at low risk of selection bias. Reports from 11 of the 12 studies described methods of random sequence generation that we judged to confer a low risk of bias; the method used in the <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK> trial was not described in sufficient detail for us to assess its risk of bias. The most common method used for random sequence generation was dynamic randomization, used in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>). Three studies used permuted block randomization designs (<LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>), two studies used random number tables or lists (<LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>), and one study only reported using a computer-randomized schema (<LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Investigators of 10 of the 12 trials reported adequate allocation concealment. In <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>, it was unclear whether the randomization sequence, determined by random number tables generated prior to study enrollment, was concealed or made available to the study investigators.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Masking (performance bias and detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>Most of the included studies we judged to be at low risk of performance bias and detection bias. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>) was an open-label study in which no form of masking was employed. Participants in the <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK> study initially were masked to the drug (not to the dosing schedule), but may have become aware of the treatment assignments due to billing records. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK> did not report whether study participants were masked. In both the <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK> studies, personnel and outcome assessors were masked. In the remaining nine studies, study participants, personnel (other than personnel directly administering treatment), and outcome assessors were masked; thus, we assessed these studies as being at low risk of performance bias and detection bias. The most common method used to mask participants in studies in which intravitreal injections were compared to no injections was the use of sham injections when participants were not assigned or did not require an injection. In the head-to-head studies of ranibizumab versus bevacizumab, participants were masked as to which treatment group they were assigned. To minimize detection bias, study investigators who were involved with assessing outcomes were separate from the treating physicians and masked to treatment groups, with the exception of the <LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK> study in which no masking was done.</P>

<P>In all 12 trials, few participants missed the follow-up examination specified as the primary time for assessing the study's primary outcome or were not treated in accord with the randomized treatment assignment. In nine trials, the rates of loss to follow up at the primary follow-up visits were less than 15%; the <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK> studies had 19%, 23%, and 21% missing data, respectively. Losses to follow up were evenly balanced across treatment groups among the included studies.</P>
<P>Seven trials included in this review analyzed the data using methods designed to overcome, in part, loss of information due to missed follow-up examinations. Six of these seven trials used the last-observation-carried-forward method to impute missing data (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MANTA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MANTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>) and the seventh trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sacu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sacu 2009</LINK>) did not report the method for imputing data for one participant with missing data. The remaining five trials reported the available-case data in which only participants with data were included in the analyses: 91.5% in <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK>, 81% in <LINK REF="STD-GEFAL-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GEFAL 2013</LINK>, 89% in <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK>, 87% in <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2011</LINK>, and 79% in <LINK REF="STD-Subramanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramanian 2010</LINK>. The investigators of all trials reported that they had analyzed data for participants by the treatment arms to which they had been assigned. However, analyses using single imputation methods or available-case data assume that participants are lost to follow up at random and may introduce bias if this assumption is not true.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pegaptanib versus sham</HEADING>
<P>One study, comprising two individual RCTs, compared three doses of intravitreal pegaptanib (0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, and 3.0 mg) with a sham injection control group (<LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK>). The study was conducted at 117 international centers and enrolled 1208 adult participants (50 years of age or older) with subfoveal CNV lesions secondary to AMD. Findings from the two trials were combined in study reports. There were 904 participants in the pegaptanib groups and 304 in the sham injection group. At one year of follow up, 1186 (98%) participants were included in the primary analyses and 1053 (87%) remained in the study and were re-randomized according to their original treatment assignment. Participants in the pegaptanib groups were re-randomized to continue current treatment or discontinue treatment and participants in the sham group were re-randomized to continue with sham injections, discontinue sham injections, or receive one of the three study doses of pegaptanib. Study follow up continued for one year after the re-randomization and participants were analyzed in three cohorts: those who continued with their original assignments, those who discontinued treatment, and those who received sham injections during the first year then pegaptanib during the second year. In total, 1053 (87%) participants were included in the two-year analysis; however, we did not analyze the two-year data since results were reported for changes from year 1 to year 2 rather than from baseline to year 2.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-VISION-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VISION 2004</LINK> study, sponsored by Eyetech Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer, was assessed as having a low risk of bias in most domains. The study had high retention rate (90% of participants followed for one year and 85% for two years).</P>

<P>More participants in the combined pegaptanib groups than in the sham group had a gain of 15 letters or more of visual acuity at year 1. Since gaining vision is a positive outcome, an RR greater than 1 favors treatment with pegaptanib. The RR for the combined pegaptanib versus sham groups was 2.83 (95% CI 1.23 to 6.52); that is, eyes treated with pegaptanib were 2.83 times more likely to gain 15 letters or more of vision than eyes treated with sham injections (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">(f) Mean change in visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>The study investigators provided us with the data required to analyze the mean change in visual acuity at one year of follow up. Visual acuity was measured using the ETDRS chart placed at 2 m from the participant. The mean change from baseline in number of letters read on the ETDRS chart was measured. The final mean visual acuity in the three active treatment groups was consistently greater than in the sham group.</P>
<P>The MD in mean change in visual acuity from baseline between the combined pegaptanib groups versus the sham group was 6.72 letters (95% CI 4.43 to 9.01), meaning that eyes treated with pegaptanib lost on average 6.72 letters fewer than eyes in the sham-treated group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). On the logMAR scale, 0.10 logMAR units correspond to 1 line (5 letters) on the visual acuity chart. Thus, the MD between the pegaptanib and sham groups was equivalent to 0.13 logMAR units; that is, the mean change in visual acuity was less in the pegaptanib groups than in the sham group by 0.13 logMAR units.</P>

At one year, data were available for 569 (98%) of the 578 study participants who completed the questionnaire at baseline.

Results for the most frequent adverse events are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Although uncommon, 12 eyes treated with pegaptanib injections for one year developed endophthalmitis, compared to no cases in control eyes.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ranibizumab versus control</HEADING>
<P>Three studies comprising a total of 1323 participants compared two doses of intravitreal ranibizumab (0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) with sham or control treatment. In the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> study, 280 participants received ranibizumab and 143 participants received verteporfin PDT therapy. Injections were administered monthly and verteporfin PDT therapy was administered on day 0 and as needed at visits at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. In the <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK> study, 478 participants received ranibizumab and 238 participants received sham injections. All injections were administered on a monthly basis. In the <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> study, 121 participants received ranibizumab and 63 participants received sham injections. Injections were administered monthly for the first three months, then every three months. During the second year of the <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> study, participants in the 0.3 mg ranibizumab and sham-treated groups crossed over to receive 0.5 mg ranibizumab.</P>
<P>Overall, we rated the risk of bias as low among the three studies. Participant masking in all studies was achieved by the use of sham injections and by sham PDT therapy in the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> study. Although the clinicians administering treatment were not masked, those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment groups. At one year of follow up, two participants, one participant in the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> study and one in the <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> study, were excluded from the analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Visual acuity</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(a) Gain of 15 letters or more of visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>At one year of follow up, we observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in the effect of ranibizumab compared with sham therapy for a gain of 15 letters or more of visual acuity; the I² statistic was 80% and the Chi² test for heterogeneity was statistically significant (P value &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Therefore, we did not combine study results in meta-analysis. The RR for a gain of 15 letters or more of visual acuity comparing the combined ranibizumab groups with sham control was 6.79 (95% CI 3.41 to 13.54) in <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>, 5.81 (95% CI 3.29 to 10.26) in <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK>, and 1.30 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.19) in <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>. Although the direction of treatment effect in all three trials included in this analysis favored ranibizumab, the magnitude of effect observed in <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> was smaller and not statistically significant compared with that observed in <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK>. This difference may have been attributable to differences among the studies with respect to dosing schedules (monthly injections in <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK> versus injections monthly for the first three months, then every three months in <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>At two years of follow up, there was less statistical heterogeneity for this outcome, as indicated by the I² statistic (30%) and the Chi² test for heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), although the <LINK REF="STD-PIER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PIER 2008</LINK> findings still deviated somewhat from those of the other two trials. The proportion of participants who were treated with ranibizumab and gained 15 letters or more at two years was 5.77 times the proportion of participants treated with control interventions who gained 15 letters or more (RR 5.77; 95% CI 3.38 to 9.84) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

<P>A greater proportion of participants treated with ranibizumab lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at one year of follow up compared with those treated with sham or control therapy. Participants were 1.53 times more likely to not lose 15 letters or more of visual acuity when treated with ranibizumab compared with sham or control therapy (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.41 to 1.64) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).

<P>At two-year follow-up, the beneficial effect of ranibizumab persisted at a similar magnitude and was statistically significant when compared with sham or control therapy.

This difference between the two trials may be because participants in the control group of the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> study received an active treatment, verteporfin PDT therapy. Subscale domains of the NEI-VFQ questionnaire in which participants in ranibizumab groups showed greater improvement at one-year of follow up than participants in control groups included near-vision activities, distance-vision activities, vision-related dependency, driving ability, general health, role difficulties, mental health, general vision, social functioning, color vision, and peripheral vision (<LINK REF="CMP-002.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.15</LINK>). The I² statistic for subscale analyses ranged from 0 to 91%, which may have been due to differences in control groups.

<P>At two years, overall vision-related quality of life improved more often among participants in ranibizumab groups compared with participants in control groups (MD 8.63; 95% CI 3.31 to 13.95).

Subscale domains of the NEI-VFQ questionnaire in which participants in ranibizumab groups showed greater improvement at two years of follow up compared with participants in control groups were consistent with those identified at one-year (<LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>). The I² statistic for subscale analyses ranged from 0 to 87%, reflecting greater comparative differences between the treatment and sham control groups in the <LINK REF="STD-MARINA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MARINA 2006</LINK> study than between the treatment and active control groups in the <LINK REF="STD-ANCHOR-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ANCHOR 2006</LINK> study.

At both the one- and two-year follow ups, there were small numbers of participants who experienced ocular adverse events, such as endophthalmitis, uveitis, retinal detachment, and retinal or vitreous hemorrhage, and non-ocular adverse events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and death (&lt; 1% of total participants). Because of the small number of events, risk estimates for these adverse events are imprecise.</P>
<P>With respect to ocular adverse events, eyes treated with ranibizumab more often developed cataracts compared with eyes in the control groups at both the one year (RR 1.48; 95% CI 0.83 to 2.66) and two year follow ups (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.66).

Participants in the as-needed dosing groups received the first three injections monthly; they then received an injection whenever treatment was needed based on monthly examinations. After one year of treatment, participants in the groups treated monthly were re-randomized to continue treatment on a monthly basis or to change to treatment as needed. Participants in the as-needed dosing groups remained on their original assignments and all participants were followed for another year. The <LINK REF="STD-IVAN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">IVAN 2013</LINK> study, with 628 participants, had four treatment groups similar to those in the CATT study: 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab monthly, 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab monthly, 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab as needed, and 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab as needed. Participants in the as-needed dosing groups received the first three injections monthly; they then received three consecutive monthly treatments whenever treatment was needed.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-19 16:56:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All twelve trials included in this systematic review were of good methodological quality and demonstrated the beneficial effect of anti-VEGF therapy on visual acuity in the management of neovascular AMD. Participants treated with any one of the anti-VEGF agents featured in these trials, pegaptanib (one trial), ranibizumab (three trials), or bevacizumab (two trials), more often maintained visual acuity at one year and less often lost visual acuity, compared with participants who received no anti-VEGF agent. Stability of visual acuity at one year was more often achieved in an anti-VEGF treatment group than in a control group not treated with anti-VEGFs. The safety profile of anti-VEGFs was acceptable based on the information reported in the included studies.</P>
<P>Functional outcomes (e.g., visual acuity) correlated with quality-of-life outcomes, when reported, and anatomic outcomes (e.g., lesion size and retinal thickening) across trials. Participants treated with pegaptanib showed a decrease in size of the choroidal neovascular complex with less leakage observed on fluorescein angiograms compared with participants treated with sham injections. In bevacizumab-treated participants, there was a reduction in CRT on OCT compared with participants in the control groups.</P>
<P>Improvement in vision-specific quality of life was reported more often in the anti-VEGF-treated groups compared to the control groups. Improved scores on the NEI-VFQ scale were reported with both pegaptanib and ranibizumab compared to controls. Cost utility analysis, based on data from one trial and with standardized utilities of degree of visual loss, which compared ranibizumab with pegaptanib found ranibizumab to be associated with a better quality of life when compared with pegaptanib (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2008</LINK>). Data on visual function (e.g., contrast sensitivity) costs were sparse in these trials.</P>
<P>We found no trial in which pegaptanib had been compared with another anti-VEGF agent head-to-head. Six head-to-head trials compared bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. At one and two years of follow up, differences between bevacizumab and ranibizumab for visual acuity outcomes were comparable clinically and statistically, although CIs for some outcomes reported by individual studies indicate some uncertainty in the true effects. In terms of visual function, one trial showed better near LogMAR visual acuity among participants in the ranibizumab groups than among participants in the bevacizumab groups at one-year follow up; this effect had diminished at two-years follow up. At one and two years of follow up, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the reduction of CRT between bevacizumab-treated participants and ranibizumab-treated participants. Participant responses to quality-of-life questionnaires were comparable between the two treatment groups. A small number of ocular adverse events were reported for both bevacizumab or ranibizumab (fewer than 1%) across all trials. However, endophthalmitis rates were higher with injection of anti-VEGF agents than with intravitreal surgery unless estimates were based on number of injections given rather than number of eyes treated. It is important that individuals with AMD and their ophthalmologists be aware of this small, but serious risk. At both one and two-year follow ups, fewer participants in the ranibizumab groups experienced any serious systemic adverse event compared with participants in the bevacizumab groups.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-19 16:02:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate both the effects and quality of life associated with intravitreally injected anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of neovascular AMD when compared to either sham treatment or a different anti-VEGF treatment administered at comparable dosages and regimens. Only RCTs were included in this review, each with a minimum follow up of one year. The primary outcome for this review was the proportion of participants who gained 15 letters or more of BCVA by the one-year follow-up examination. Secondary outcomes included other visual acuity outcomes at one and two years of follow up, visual function outcomes, morphological characteristics assessed by fluorescein angiography or OCT, ocular and systemic adverse outcomes, cost outcomes, and quality-of-life measures. Multiple sources were used to identify relevant data for this review, not only journal publications, but also conference abstracts, FDA documents, and clinical trial registries. When data were unclear or missing, study investigators were contacted for clarification or information.</P>
<P>This review ultimately included representative and applicable outcomes data on 5496 participants from 12 trials conducted in various countries that included both men and women aged 50 years or older with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. Approximately half of the trials reported the type of neovascular lesion, with all lesion types (predominantly classic CNV, minimally classic CNV, and occult CNV only) represented among these trials. All studies included at least one measure related to the morphological characteristics of study eyes, with fluorescein angiography used in all studies and OCT used in all but the earliest of these 12 RCTs.</P>
<P>The initial RCTs of anti-VEGF agents incorporated in this review, both individually and collectively, established a new paradigm for the management of neovascular AMD, particularly for lesions under or near the central fovea, and validated the administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy in affected individuals with clinical profiles similar to those of the participants enrolled in these trials. Reported outcomes related to visual acuity gains, the stability of visual acuity at one year, the decreased risk of significant visual acuity loss, and the low rates of ocular and systemic adverse events are mirrored in real-life clinical encounters when anti-VEGF agents are used to manage neovascular AMD in the retina specialist's office (<LINK REF="REF-Carneiro-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carneiro 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 2014</LINK>). As observed in the clinical trials incorporated into this review, morphologic changes in the CNV lesion complex, with regard to decreased size on fluorescein angiography, decreased leakage on fluorescein angiography, and decreased CRT on OCT, are also observed to occur in-office in individuals receiving anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Carneiro-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carneiro 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>With completion of head-to-head trials of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab, and the finding of little or no difference in outcomes between the two drugs, a major challenge for the ophthalmologist and individual with AMD has been the choice of anti-VEGF agent. Issues considered have been costs, availability, and quality control of the preparation of bevacizumab for intravitreal injection. Issues as yet unresolved are the optimal frequency with which anti-VEGF agents should be injected in most affected eyes, the length of calendar time over which anti-VEGF agents must be injected to maintain the benefits seen with two-year outcomes, and the long-term ocular and systemic effects of these treatments.</P>

<P>In addition to the inclusion of only RCTs in this review, two review authors assessed potential sources of bias in these trials according to methods established by The Cochrane Collaboration. Parameters considered included selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias; each potential source of bias was graded as low risk, unclear risk, or high risk. Overall, the included studies were found to be at low risk for all categories of bias. In all 12 trials, few participants missed the primary outcome visit or were not treated per-protocol assignment. In nine trials, the rates of loss to follow up at the primary follow-up visits were less than 15%. Athough not the best method to account for missing data, six trials used the last-observation-carried&#8211;forward method to impute missing data. Protocols or clinical trial registrations were identified for 11 of the 12 included studies. Seven of these 11 trials were judged to be free of reporting bias based on the consistency between study outcomes defined in the protocols and clinical trial registers and those reported in study publications to date.</P>
<P>Various other aspects of trial design, reporting, and financial support were considered as potential sources of bias. Four of 12 trials, one study of pegaptanib and three studies comparing ranibizumab with controls, were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that marketed the study drugs under investigation. In addition, the pharmaceutical company sponsors had important roles in the design, analysis, and reporting of these trials and some of the investigators reported that they had financial relationships with the company that manufactured the study drug.</P>

<P>Whether assessed by systematic, comprehensive reviews, like this one, or by more traditional, clinical reviews, treatments for neovascular AMD with anti-VEGF compounds appear to be efficacious and safe (<LINK REF="REF-Ip-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ip 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmucker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmucker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmucker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmucker 2012</LINK>). Beneficial effects with pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab are evident in terms of the proportion of participants with stabilization or small losses of BCVA. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab additionally resulted in a greater proportion of participants with improved BCVA after one and two years of injections. In independent studies and comprehensive reviews, visual acuity effects have been consistent with morphologic changes in the size and composition of the CNV lesion complex as well as with the observed change in CRT on OCT following treatment with these agents. In general, considerations of costs were limited in the trials included in this systematic review; additional analyses indicating a favorable cost utility ratio for anti-VEGF agents versus control or no treatment were cited in research using RCT and observational data (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez_x002d_Pastor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez-Pastor 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javitt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Javitt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolowacz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wolowacz 2007</LINK>). Economic analyses have documented the lower cost of bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab to achieve the same benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Raftery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2014</LINK>). A separate Cochrane review specifically evaluating the systemic safety of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab also concluded no significant differences between intravitreal injection of the two drugs after two years of follow up with respect to deaths or overall serious systemic adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Moja-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moja 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review indicate effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) in terms of the stability or improvement in visual acuity after one and two years of treatment. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab have resulted in improved visual acuity in a sizable fraction of treated eyes. The beneficial effects of these anti-VEGF agents with respect to visual acuity are consistent with their effects on changes in lesion size evaluated on fluorescein angiograms and by OCT. The available information on adverse effects with each medication does not suggest a higher incidence of potentially vision-threatening complications with intravitreal injection compared with control interventions; however, clinical trial data may not be sufficiently powered to detect rare safety outcomes. We found no trials that had compared pegaptanib directly with either ranibizumab or bevacizumab.</P>
<P>At the time of this review, bevacizumab remains an off-label therapy for neovascular AMD. The manufacturer (Genentech) that produces both bevacizumab and ranibizumab has not submitted bevacizumab for approval as a treatment for AMD. As bevacizumab is a significantly less expensive treatment option, it perhaps would compete with the company's more costly and FDA-approved ophthalmic anti-VEGF agent, ranibizumab. Thus, trials comparing functional, anatomic, vision-specific quality of life, and cost utility outcomes between bevacizumab and ranibizumab ultimately may have no effect on the treatment of individuals with neovascular AMD if off-label therapy with bevacizumab is proscribed. The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) and other national health agencies currently cover bevacizumab for ophthalmic use in hospital outpatient settings; however, other national health agencies do not include off-label use bevacizumab in their coverage (<LINK REF="REF-CMS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMS 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2014</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-19 16:59:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the use of anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of AMD becomes part of standard clinical practice, certain issues regarding their use remain. Several factors encourage evaluation of the efficacy of alternative and less-frequent dosing regimens with anti-VEGF compounds. Some of these include concerns about ocular and systemic toxicity, the convenience to individuals with AMD and their physicians of fewer intravitreal injections, and the costs of treatment. Research evaluating the long-term use of anti-VEGF agents should consider both the effects of the drugs on vision and the long-term effects of multiple injections over time. It is unclear how best to evaluate these effects as RCTs to identify rare events during long follow-up periods are difficult to conduct and finance. Data for up to seven years of follow up have been reported for some RCTs included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Rofagha-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rofagha 2013</LINK>); however, these follow-up data are observational, were not part of the trial protocols, and include only a subset of originally enrolled participants. The <LINK REF="STD-CATT-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CATT 2011</LINK> trial has received funding from the US National Eye Institute to continue follow up of participants enrolled in that trial in order to document long-term positive and negative effects of anti-VEGF treatment.</P>
<P>The use of anti-VEGF agents in combination with other neovascular AMD treatments, such at PDT or intravitreal steroids, is an important and active area of research since the acceptance of anti-VEGF therapy may make it unethical to conduct trials without providing this treatment to all participants with neovascular AMD. The goal of combination treatments would be to improve vision and quality of life even further than what is achievable with anti-VEGF agents alone, and perhaps reduce the number of intravitreal injections needed. Research also is needed to evaluate methods of delivering the agents other than intravitreally. Possibilities already under development are implants and refillable reservoirs (<LINK REF="REF-de-Juan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Juan 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The inclusion criteria were modified between the 2008 publication and this update to the review. In the 2008 publication, all trials that investigated anti-VEGF agents, alone or in conjunction with other treatments, were eligible for inclusion in the review. For this update of the review, we did not include studies in which anti-VEGF treatment was given in combination with other AMD treatments. These combination therapies for AMD will be covered in a separate Cochrane review. Thus, the <LINK REF="STD-FOCUS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">FOCUS 2006</LINK> trial, which was included in the 2008 publication, was not included in this update of the review.</P>
<P>The primary outcome for this update was changed from 'loss of 15 letters or more of visual acuity at one year to 'gain of 15 letters or more of visual acuity at one year'. The primary outcome was changed from the protocol and 2008 publication to reflect advancements in the treatment of AMD, which now provide the potential to improve vision. We swapped the number of events with non-events for negative outcomes in order to maintain the same direction of the treatment effect across outcomes.</P>

<B>Study design comment</B>: following primary analyses of the study at one year and with recommendation of the data monitoring committee, the study protocol was amended to offer treatment with 0.5 mg ranibizumab to participants still being followed in the sham control group. The study protocol was amended four months into the study to allow photodynamic therapy for active minimally classic or occult with no classic lesions that were no larger than 4 disc areas in size and accompanied by a 20-letter or greater loss from baseline visual acuity confirmed at consecutive study visits. When photodynamic therapy was used, the scheduled study treatment was postponed until the next scheduled monthly study visit.<BR/>
