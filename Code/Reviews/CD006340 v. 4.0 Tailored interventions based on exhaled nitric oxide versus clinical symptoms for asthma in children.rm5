This is my version 7! I hope it reflects your intentions in the original. I have revised some of the categories in the GradePRO file and all outcomes are now from moderate to low. Some of this is inevitably subjective but I think this may be the best we can do for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you happy for this to be published tomorrow please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Anne and Helen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well done&lt;/b&gt;, we are nearly there. Please send me the GradePRO file that you have used. We are all on a learning curve here and I would like to take out the combined adult and children outcomes as these do not help clinicians (in my view). Also I need to downgrade the high result as it is not statistically significant and the confidence interval includes possible harm and benefit. I have taken out the pooled diamonds for adults and children in the metaview plots and have also taken out the NNT results and changed to natural frequencies (using the caption from the Cates plots). I will prune some of the double lines out of the SoF as well (where two baselines are used that are very similar). I take the reviewer's point about random effects for heterogeneity in ICS dose and Geometric Mean of FeNO level and reported these alongside the fixed effects results for these outcomes, removing the line in sensitivity analysis about random effects making no difference to statistical significance as this is not true for ICS!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you trust me to tidy up the SoF tables? If I can do it tomorrow early I can send you the revised version pronto to see if we can squeeze in for the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have copy-edited the results so they are all written in the same style (using Format and insert results from RevMan for safety) and trimmed what's new to make the update one event!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris, Please find my comments and responses to peer (mine in italics). My biggest concern was the SOF tables. Anne and I are new to these so I have followed the information on the Cochrane website and the help files on GradePro. If they need to be changed, I will have to do it from my files. GradePro is good how it imports the data but I still found it very repetitive from ROB table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry it has taken so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer Review Comments June 30th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC_ My actions are included in square brackets and are shown in text as tracked changes for authors approval. Please respond to the questions in &lt;b&gt;BOLD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;!To me, this is a very well written and easy to read review.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 2, data collection and analysis: Data was analysed as &amp;quot;intervention received&amp;quot; and sensitivity analyses performed.. To me (and I assume to other readers as well) the label &amp;#8220;intervention received&amp;#8221; is not clear. Either deleted or describe what you mean. The last part of this sentence seems to be incomplete. [I have deleted] &lt;i&gt;Thanks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 2, last sentence in main results: the abbreviation ICS should be written out full. Is this an accepted abbreviation in asthma research? To me, this is a somewhat odd abbreviation (CS = Cortico Steroids?) and CS is also used in the rest of the text for Clinical Symptoms arm. You may wish to avoid this abbreviation in the whole document. [Written in full here and ICS is fine to use but I agree that CS is confusing and have removed the latter] &lt;i&gt;Again thanks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 2, PLS: replace the somewhat impolite label &amp;#8220;subjects&amp;#8221; into &amp;#8220;persons&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;participants with asthma&amp;#8221;. [Done]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 3, types of outcome measures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The outcome is not &amp;#8220;Number of participants who had asthma exacerbations during follow-up&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;Asthma exacerbations during follow-up&amp;#8221;. Analogously, not &amp;#8220;Mean difference in asthma related outcome measures&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;Asthma related outcome measures&amp;#8221;, etc. [&lt;b&gt;See comment below on possible problem with rates or exacerbation.&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Changed to &amp;quot;Asthma exacerbations during follow-up&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;Dose of inhaled corticosteroid used was also described as a post-hoc analysis&amp;#8221;: I&amp;#8217;m afraid that I don&amp;#8217;t understand this sentence. Here the methods are presented. How can you know that you will analyse these data &amp;#8216;post-hoc&amp;#8221;? Am I missing the clue? [Also added as change from protocol]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 4, Assessment of risk of bias: this section must be new for this update. I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether the authors have followed the handbook here. E.g. item 3 &amp;#8220;Bllinding&amp;#8221;: shouldn&amp;#8217;t a distinction be made between objective outcomes and subjective outcomes (so two RoB items for blinding)? Why haven&amp;#8217;t the authors included the very important item &amp;#8220;Incomplete outcome data addressed&amp;#8221;, including a distinction between primary and secondary outcomes? And what about the item &amp;#8220;Free of selective reporting&amp;#8221;?&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-06-30 11:14:00 +0100&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;[&lt;b&gt;What do you think?&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ROB table has been completed in full. Unsure of the &amp;quot;blinding between objective and subjective outcoms&amp;quot; - I have followed the Handbook on ROB and specifically section 8.13 on blinding. I cannot see in the handbook about 2 items for blinding???&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is taking only data from the first arm in the meta analysis according to the advise of the Handbook (and not advocated in Elbourne 2002)? If I remember correctly, this is used only when it&amp;#8217;s not appropriate to conduct a cross-over study or if there&amp;#8217;s a significant carry-over effect. In all other situations taking only the first period may introduce bias (see Handbook, chapter 16). [I have removed this sentence]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Page 6, effects of interventions:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please use exactly the same headings / labels and sequence as mentioned in the methods section. The presentation is now somewhat confusing to me.[&lt;b&gt;What do you think? The text matches the Data and analyses so could we adjust the methods section to match better?&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;I have changed the methods section to reflect the data and analyses.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shouldn&amp;#8217;t a more clear distinction be made between short-term and long-term effects? It would be helpful if the authors consequently present this distinction (because it then will become crystal clear where results are missing). [&lt;b&gt;What do you think?&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;Due to the intervention (FeNO) I don't think this is relevant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it really possible to calculate NNTBs and NNTHs when an effect is not significant? To me, this is very confusing: the NNTB of 13 is the lower limit; it will rise to infinity, and then the NNTH appears as upper limit. Is this really valid? [This is a fair point but the SoF tables use this approach, see mention of this below. &lt;b&gt;We could just use the natural frequencies and not report NNTs as statistical significance is not achieved. What do you think about this as a compromise?&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;We had discussed this previously but agreed to leave in but I am unsure what you mean by using the natural frequencies. Could you please adjust or explain?&lt;b&gt;CJC has changed to natural frequencies to match SoF tables.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.2.1 Exacerbation rates: the results here are (correctly) presented as average number of exacerbations and MDs. Isn&amp;#8217;t the label &amp;#8220;Mean number of exacerbations per X weeks/months&amp;#8221; better? [&lt;b&gt;What do you think? The three studies are all around a year&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;Changed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s vast heterogeneity between studies: are all those meta-analyses possible / sensible? Can studies of children and adults safely be pooled together (in some forest plots: see also later)? In some forest plots the I-square is very high and a fixed effect method has been applied. Are you sure that this is feasible? [&lt;b&gt;What do you think?&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;We had previously discussed this and agreed not to pool together. I don't think it feasible to pool adults and children. &lt;b&gt;CJC has also added random effects to outcomes with high I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 16, ongoing studies: details of the studies labeled Anon and Roberts are not filled in. Anon is included in ClinTrials.gov (NB: if no usable data are available on that site, this would be a disgrace for ClinTrials.gov!) [&lt;b&gt;Can you add anything for the ongoing studies?] &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My mistake, I have removed Anon as it was Szefler's paper. As for Roberts, I know no more. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 17: a Summary of Findings Table is lacking. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be very useful to the end-user if a SoF Table + GRADE profile would be added (although I like Cates&amp;#8217; system very much as well)? The Table will be very empty, indicating the amount of uncertainty that we have? [&lt;b&gt;Should we add an SoF table? Actually I think figures 3 and 4 do the same job but do not include the GRADE profiles! We would need a fuller Risk of Bias table to do this properly&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;I have added SOF tables. I used GradePro which imported all data into 2 tables, I hope this is correct. SOF tables are new for both Anne and I so have just followed what I could from internet and GradePro's help menu.&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;Figures 3 and 4 are the Cates plots, which by previous comments the reviewer wanted removed. I have left them in but if you wish to remove them and include &amp;quot;natural frequencies&amp;quot; please feel free.&lt;b&gt;CJC left pictures but swapped NNT for SoF style natural frequencies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page 27-29: the labels are incorrect. Comparison = NO vs CS (both written out in full). Outcome = one or more asthma exacerbation, etc.[ &lt;b&gt;I have relabelled the caption for figures 3 and 4 - is it correct to say &amp;quot;symptom control&amp;quot; for the control arms or is this an oversimplification?] &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;No I think this is fine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC May 18th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see changes in green. Not sure where SMD came from in terms of adult ICS dose, I have changed this back to match figure 10. In view of higher overall ICS use in SHAW I have deleted the potential benefit in adults on high doses of ICS. The jury is still out until we sort out how on earth to use the FeNO results in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it may be ok to use NNT when not significant, as we do this with Summary of Findings tables. Let's see what the Peer Reviewers think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Feb 24th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Comparison One added in which adults and children/adolescents are shown in separate subgroups. I have left the other data for now for cross-checking but would remove other comparisons before publication. I think a table indicating the cut level of FeNO in each study and the additional safety measures on ICS dose might be useful? FENO and Symptoms both set to SMD in view of different scales used. Also the definition of exacerbation used from each paper might be helpful (as this is not uniform in the study designs or in the data extraction, sometimes we have used patients with one or more courses of oral steroids, and sometimes the paper definition of exacerbations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think ICS results reflect study design rather than a genuine difference between adults and children - what do you both think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See what you think,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Helen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sending the data to me at this point. I notice that the mean age in de Jongste is eleven and a half and in Szefler is it fourteen and a half. This being the case I think it is rather odd to place them in different age-group categories. Since Fritsch and Pijnenburg are both mean age of twelve, both the two new studies should go with these! If Anne agrees this will need some restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added some notes to the data tables where you have added the new study data. Some of the comments will not apply necessarily if you move Szefler, but the data extraction in general looks fine. I have added FeNO data for de Jongste. If the scales are different SMD must be used. Also we cannot combine % symptom free days with a change in mean symptom score as they are totally different types of scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you discuss with Anne please? Are you going to be in Darwin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Jan 30&lt;br&gt;Thanks Anne. I agree that a single cut off is problematic. The discussion in its revised form makes this much clearer. I do not think any more changes are needed so: Green light for publication!&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Chris- what we were trying to express that a single cut-off for everyone irrespective of atopy status and height status etc, is not reasonable as eNO is dependent on atopy (plus presence of a cold, season, exercise, BMI etc) as the single most predictive factor of eNO level. The studies used this (although at different cut-offs) a single cut off was still used. My guess is that the reviewer is pro eNO. People without asthma but with atopy can have high eNO and people with neutrophilic asthma but have atopy can have high eNO. I have just been through the SIGN process with the BTS asthma group for diagnosis and we also went through this exercise. I thus disagree with the reviewer on issue of atopy. I guess it leaves for us to better express it in the text (as I have tried to do and add in the relevant references.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3.1&lt;br&gt;CJC Jan 29th&lt;br&gt;Peer review comments have come back about the danger of overgeneralising the results (the papers tested titration of ICS only, not any possible use of FeNO) and advised removing the comments on atopy.&lt;br&gt;I have made some changes in red to emphasis that ICS titration is the subject of all four papers.&lt;br&gt;I have altered the emphasis in the direction of the fact that the studies used different thresholds and algorithms, and having read all the papers quite careful, it is not clear to me how FeNO should be used in clinical practice. The final ICS dose should not be overinterpreted in the light of the overall usage in Shaw, and the scatter plot illustrates the problem of poor correlation with eosinophils in this paper. Also Smith had to use a safety net sputum eosinophil measurement for those on high dose ICS whose FeNO did not come down.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This review thus suggest that the benefits of FeNO based strategy for the management of asthma is limited.&amp;quot; I have removed this from the discussion as the Peer reviewer felt this was much broader than the results justify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not know how to respond to the following Peer Reviewer response:&lt;br&gt;'The authors attempt to explain why it might be that FeNO measurements do not provide benefit in terms of ICS dose adjustment. But in doing so the arguments are either poorly thought out or do not have their origins in the problems contained in the four papers.&lt;br&gt;The second paragraph on page 9 deals with the issue of atopy. The authors are quite mistaken in their view that the outcomes of the four studies may have been influenced by the presence or absence of atopy. If a subject had non-atopic asthma, then this would lead to consistently low FeNO levels, and hence a reduction in the inhaled corticosteroid dose. This is entirely appropriate given that non-atopic asthma is usually not steroid responsive. Conversely, if the patient had atopic asthma with variable or high FeNO levels, then when levels rise above the designated cut points, inhaled corticosteroid therapy would be appropriately increased. Thus irrespective of the atopic status, FeNO levels have a role.'&lt;br&gt;(The Peer Reviewer also suggested removing atopy from the suggested subgroups for future research.)&lt;br&gt;If the point is that atopic individuals can still have high FeNO on large doses of ICS, as correlation with eosinophils is poor, then this needs to be stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do however have a problem with the logic of the paragraph about atopy and height. What is the precise point in relation to atopy and height (for example do you think a cut-off that reflects one of both of these could work better)? This would be conjecture but needs stating more clearly.&lt;br&gt;My main reservations are different cut-offs, different aims (prevent exacerbations or reduce ICS load), hence different algorithms. All of these would make application very difficult. Moreover the need to have a safety bronchoscopy at high dose to cut down on unnecessary steroids is a serious drawback this is currently not mentioned here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you revisit the discussion please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3.1&lt;br&gt;CJC Jan 21st&lt;br&gt;Thanks Anne,&lt;br&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br&gt;I have cut the following sentence as I do not think it is safe to use subgroups in advocating who benefits from FeNO. The trials are too clinically different and the match between FeNO and eosinophils is not too good as shown in the scatter plot from Shaw. We do not yet now exactly how to use FeNO! &amp;quot;It may have a role only in adults on moderate to high inhaled corticosteroid doses.&amp;quot; Similar modification to conclusions in the abstract.&lt;br&gt;Description of studies:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In Smith et al's study, medications were based on maintaining FeNO less than 15ppb at a flow rate of 250 ml per second, which the authors found to be equivalent to 35 ppb at a flow rate of 50 ml per second.&amp;quot; Flow rate information added in red.&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;Clarification added to overall ICS use in Shaw paper: the FeNO group used 11% more ICS overall than the control group, although the difference was non significant (95% CI: -15% to 37%).&lt;br&gt;I could not see any addition figure for 2#5 so have reworded the text to Forest plot.&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Its utilisation, if any, is likely limited to adults who are on high doses of ICS. However as the studies did not stratify the subjects or analyse the data based on ICS doses, even this finding is limited. &amp;quot; I have removed this and added the caveat from the Shaw paper about Feno correlation to Eosinophils and upper limit test.&lt;br&gt;I am happy to send this out for Peer Review if you are OK with this version. If you can send us the figure we will attach it and add the appropriate links.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;===============================&lt;br&gt;CJC Jan 19th&lt;br&gt;Thanks for revisiting this. I will send you the spreadsheets back with comments but they are also below; Action needed where marked.&lt;br&gt;Dear Anne (re spreadsheet for P values)&lt;br&gt;For the Pijenberg symptoms scores these are changes from baseline as described on page 834&lt;br&gt;The correct SD for each group is 2,68 as shown on the previous page.&lt;br&gt;This calculation above not correct because the P value refers to the difference between arms not the spread of each arm&lt;br&gt;The sheet is from Julian Higgins and very useful and I have put it at the front of your spread sheet.&lt;br&gt;I have amended the data table for this but not the text of the results *** Please change in the text*****&lt;br&gt;Dear Anne (re CI spreadsheet)&lt;br&gt;Pijenburg seems to have FEV and Feno reversed above. The correct FEV1 data is calculated on the preceeding spreadsheet and I have entered this into the Data tables but not changed the text.&lt;br&gt;Pijenburg Feno is much more complex and I have done this using GIV (see last page but sit down first and do not try this one at home)!&lt;br&gt;I agree with your calculations for SMITH exacerbations. It does not match the paper but I think this is because they have used ratios not difference, but this is fine.&lt;br&gt;Smith ICS doses are correct from the paper but I note that they do not take baseline imbalance of 80 mcg into account! Worth a mention in discussion perhaps, this may be why the paper shows 0.003 for this data and RevMan 0.0005 (found by turning off Shaw and P value for Smith is shown). This study shows where skew makes mean and median different.&lt;br&gt;Smith FEV1 looks fine.&lt;br&gt;Smith symptoms fine but again baseline imbalance&lt;br&gt;Smith FeNO looks fine too&lt;br&gt;Again please update the text for the new Pijenberg data.&lt;br&gt;Phew! What about the combinations of data. Well, I have checked the Fritsch ICS data and it is all medians so best not put in RevMAn. I think you should just quote the 0.2mg higher ICS use in the FeNO arm of the model.&lt;br&gt;I have removed the combinations for adults and children except number exacerbating and final ICS levels. As before I feel there are two many other differences to try to draw out much from children v adult comparisons.&lt;br&gt;Can you check what I have done and adjust the text before I try to do any more editing please!&lt;br&gt;We are getting there!!!!!&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;============================&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Jan 15th&lt;br&gt;Dear Anne and Helen&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the raw data sheets. I have gone through all the data that has been entered and would make the following suggestions:&lt;br&gt;1. Comparison 1#2 is wrong because LOG rates have been entered instead of LN (natural logs). However I would not use GIV at all for this outcome as Smith and Shaw both given mean and SD for exacerbation rates and this is more informative to the reader. Please use WMD for this analysis of exacerbation rates in adults.&lt;br&gt;2. Comparison 1#3 uses the data for final dose of ICS in the two adult studies. It needs to be relabelled as such and the results and discussion must also add that the overall dose of ICS in the Shaw study was higher with FeNO (the final dose was the only lower dose!)/&lt;br&gt;3. Comparison 1#6 data for Shaw seems to come from Figure 3 and my ruler indicates 1.1 as a final score not 0.98 for the control group. Where did 0.98 come from? Would you like to change this?&lt;br&gt;4. Comparison 2#1 leaves me puzzled as to the derivation of 4 and 5 for the Fritsch patients with at least one exacerbation. I could not see these in the paper.&lt;br&gt;5. Comparison 2#2 is wrong and needs to be removed. Whilst Pijnenburg is a reasonable approximation, the Fritsch data in Table 2 are not in separate patients so cannot be added together. Since adults are changing to WMD for exacerbation rates, this outcome is not available in the two kids studies and cannot be compared across ages.&lt;br&gt;6. Comparison 2#3 is the average daily dose in Fritsch but not Pij, I am not sure if this is end of study ICS doses from the graph. Anyway the two measures are separate and cannot go into one outcome. You could relabel this as final dose and add a new average outcome, but each would only have one study.&lt;br&gt;7. Comparisons 3#2 needs to come out in view of the above, and 3#3 needs relabel and removal of Fritsch.&lt;br&gt;Please could you attend to the above and revisit the results/discussion/conclusions accordingly. FeNO is used in different ways in all these studies so care with interpretation is needed. By the way Smith mentions on p 2165 that their 15 ppb threshold is equivalent to 35 ppb at a slower 50ml/sec flow rate. This could be worth pointing out.&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Review Editing CJC Jan 7th&lt;br&gt;I have read through all the included studies with some care, and would suggest that the review needs a rethink.&lt;br&gt;1. I am concerned about the data extraction as the exacerbation rate reduction in the forest plot for Smith &amp;amp; Shaw do not agree with the results in the paper. Please could you send me the data and calculations that you used for this outcome in adults and children.&lt;br&gt;2. I am also concerned that you may have entered medians and IQR instead of means for the ICS doses so could you clarify where you derived these from as well.&lt;br&gt;3. There is considerable clinical heterogeneity between the studies and I do not think it is wise to try to attribute any differences in outcomes to single parameters (adults and children for example).&lt;br&gt;4. ICS dose was not in your protocol so this is a post hoc analysis and needs to be reported with much more caution. As I read the papers Shaw found an increase in overall ICS use and it only fell at the last measurement. Smith showed ICS reduction in a very complex design and at the expense of increased numbers of patients exacerbating. Fritch chose FEV1 as the primary outcome and Pijnenburg cumulative steroid dose, whilst Shaw and Smith used exacerbations as primary outcome. This matters because FeNO was used in different ways in all the algorithms.&lt;br&gt;Please can we untangle the data entry first and then decide where to go on the reporting of the results. The conclusions at present are misleading as they are based on one of many possible interpretations of the data. I think the bottom line needs changing to reflect that so far it has not been possible to demonstrate reductions in exacerbations using FeNO. For ICS only Smitn has shown a reduction using a complex run-in design. The jury is still out in terms of benefits in practice in my view.&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Protocol Editing by CJC Nov 14th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers Contributions: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: checked by Susan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &amp;quot;The proportions of participants and the mean clinical improvement will be determined using the following hierarchy of assessment measures (ie. where two or more assessment measures are reported in the same study, the outcome measure that is listed first in the hierarchy will be used); &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I am not sure what your intentions are for the full review. I would not advocate a global definition of exacerbations and then include hospitalisations from one review and increased use of Beta-agonists from another (but I guess you are not planning to do this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: I am not quite sure how you will define 'classical' asthma - clinical definition or according to guidelines? Also I think that technically some of the sensitivity analyses are actually sub-group analyses, but this is not crucial for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - Good protocol.

<TITLE>Tailoring asthma interventions based on exhaled nitric oxide</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 00:15:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>In this review involving 1010 adults and children with asthma, we found that tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide (compared to clinical symptoms with or without spirometry/peak flow) was beneficial in reducing the final (but not the overall) daily inhaled corticosteroid doses in adults. However in children inhaled corticosteroid dose was increased when exhaled nitric oxide guided strategy was used. There was no difference between groups in other asthma outcomes (exacerbations, spirometry, FeNO or symptom control). Thus tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide cannot be routinely advocated.</P>

<P>The measurement of severity and control of asthma in both children and adults can be based on subjective or objective measures. It has been advocated that fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) can be used to monitor airway inflammation as it correlates with some markers of asthma.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 22:23:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Two studies have been added for this update, which now includes six (2 adults and 4 children/adolescent) studies; these studies differed in a variety of ways including definition of asthma exacerbations, FeNO cut off levels, the way in which FeNO was used to adjust therapy and duration of study. Of 1053 participants randomised, 1010 completed the trials. In the meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of asthma exacerbations or for other outcomes (clinical symptoms, FeNO level and spirometry). In post-hoc analysis, a significant reduction in mean final daily dose inhaled corticosteroid per adult was found in the group where treatment was based on FeNO in comparison to clinical symptoms, (mean difference -450 mcg; 95% CI -677 to -223 mcg budesonide equivalent/day). However, the total amount of inhaled corticosteroid used in one of the adult studies was 11% greater in the FeNO arm. In contrast, in the paediatric studies, there was a significant increase in inhaled corticosteroid dose in the FeNO strategy arm (mean difference of 140 mcg; 95% CI 29 to 251, mcg budesonide equivalent/day).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-30 19:39:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide in comparison to clinical symptoms was carried out in different ways in the six studies and found only modest benefit at best and potentially higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids in children. The role of utilising exhaled nitric oxide to tailor the dose of inhaled corticosteroids cannot be routinely recommended for clinical practice at this stage and remains uncertain.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 00:56:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-11 00:56:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The severity and control of asthma in both children and adults can be based on subjective or objective measures. Subjective measures usually involve a series of questions used for clinical assessment, diary cards and quality of life questionnaires. Traditional objective measures include peak flow monitoring, spirometry and degree of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) (<LINK REF="STD-Zacharasiewicz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zacharasiewicz 2005</LINK>). Based on current data on airway inflammation and asthma, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is advocated as a monitoring marker for asthma control in adults and children. Some have suggested use of an algorithm that is based on FeNO to tailor asthma medications (<LINK REF="REF-Szefler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szefler 2005</LINK>) instead of the traditional use of clinical symptoms and simple spirometry.</P>
<P>In asthma, inflammation can be eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic (<LINK REF="REF-Douwes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douwes 2002</LINK>). Corticosteroids which targets eosinophilic inflammation is a key medication in the management of asthma. Assessing airway inflammation by quantitative measurements of eosinophilic inflammation, instead of subjective data, potentially allows the physician to tailor personal asthma interventions. In patients with eosinophilic inflammation the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), reduces exacerbations and improves symptoms and asthma control. Eosinophilic inflammation can be measured by cell count in sputum or FeNO level. FeNO correlates with other markers of asthma e.g.. eosinophilia in induced sputum (<LINK REF="REF-Jatakanon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jatakanon 1998</LINK>) and bronchial reactivity in non-steroid treated subjects (<LINK REF="REF-Dupont-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dupont 1998</LINK>). However, induced sputum and sputum analysis is labour intensive and not widely available in non-research laboratories. Hypertonic saline, used to induce sputum may also temporarily increase asthma symptoms. Measures of FeNO thus confer some advantage over measurements of sputum eosinophils. However it does not provide any data on non-eosinophilic inflammation and the equipment required to measure FeNO is relatively expensive.</P>
<P>A systematic review evaluating the efficacy of tailoring asthma interventions based on exhaled nitric oxide in comparison with the traditional reliance upon clinical symptoms of asthma (with or without spirometry/peak flow) will be useful to guide clinical practice.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-05-19 01:12:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria were reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible subjects), inclusion and exclusion criteria, other symptoms, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of intervention, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data was extracted on the outcomes described previously and data from included studies was double entered into RevMan 5.0 for meta-analysis. Initial attempts to contact the corresponding authors were not successful, but further information was made available by one author from a new paper <LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK> for this update.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-05-13 08:29:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen L Petsky">
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, relative and absolute risk reductions were calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis when the outcome event is a beneficial event. When the event is non-beneficial event (such as exacerbation), "treatment received" analysis was utilised. A modified intention-to-treat analysis assumes that participants not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies examined whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This took into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 00:15:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest were included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) were calculated (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan 5.0). For Rate Ratios of common events whereby one subject may have more than one event, GIV was utilised. The Rate Ratios were taken from the published papers and the standard errors were calculated from confidence intervals or P values published in the papers. It was planned for cross-over studies, mean treatment differences would be calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as fixed effects generic inverse variance (GIV) outcome, to provide summary weighted differences and 95% confidence intervals. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). The outcome indices were assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes could be estimated (weighted mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference was estimated. Any heterogeneity between the study results was described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test. The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random effects model was included whenever there are concerns about statistical heterogeneity. Heterogeneity is considered significant when the P value is &lt;0.10 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>In all studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK>) asthma management were based on either clinical strategy/symptoms (control arm) or exhaled nitric oxide, with or without taking the symptoms into account (intervention arm). The management of the control arm in the studies differed. In <LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK> treatment was based on symptom score which was sent by electronic diary every 3 weeks. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK> based their treatment decision on symptoms, use of short acting beta-2-agonists and lung function. <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2005</LINK> used symptom scores from diary cards to guide their decision on treatment; it was a cumulative score for the 2 weeks prior to each visit. <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK>, used the British Thoracic Society asthma guidelines to base their treatment decisions which included traditional assessment of symptoms (using validated Juniper asthma control questionnaire). <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK> used asthma symptoms, nighttime waking, bronchodilator use, variation in peak expiratory flow rate in previous 7 days and FEV<SUB>1</SUB>. Subjects had their asthma management based on standard treatment as per the guidelines of National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) in <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The intervention arm in all 6 studies, although primarily based on FeNO level, differed in the cut off for FeNO for change in therapy. In de Jongste et al's study and Fritsch et al's study, anti-inflammatory treatment was based on keeping FeNO below 20 ppb. In Pijnenburg et al's study, medication was adjusted to keep FeNO less than 30 ppb. Shaw et al's study aimed at keeping FeNO below 26 ppb with a minimum dose of anti-inflammatory treatment. In Smith et al's study, medications were based on maintaining FeNO less than 15 ppb at a flow rate of 250 ml per second, which the authors found to be equivalent to 35 ppb at a flow rate of 50 ml per second. Szefler et al used a combination of different levels of FeNO and symptoms with control level of no anti-inflammatory treatment changes if FeNo was less than 20 ppb. All other studies utilised a single cut off for FeNO and none of the studies took into account the presence of atopy.</P>
<P>The measurement of FeNO was different among studies. All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK>) was a hospital based FeNO measurement. De Jongste used a portable at home exhaled nitric oxide analyser. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK>) were performed in accordance to ATS/ERS guidelines for measuring FeNO (flow rate 50mL/s). Smith et al used a flow rate of 250mL/s.</P>
<P>The follow up of the six studies also differed: one of the studies <LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK> had a duration of 30 weeks with treatment potentially being altered every 3 weeks; (<LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK>) ran for 6 months with the participants being assessed in 6 week intervals; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2005</LINK> ran for twelve month duration with three monthly visits; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK> had a study duration of twelve months with participants being assessed 10 times;<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK> had a study duration for a maximum of 2 years, with phase 1 running between 3 and 12 months and phase 2 having 6 visits in 12 months; and <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK> ran for 46 weeks with scheduled visits every 6 to 8 weeks</P>
<P>Exacerbations were defined differently in each included study. An exacerbation was defined as: emergency visit, hospitalization or prednisolone course in <LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK> study asthma exacerbations were defined by 4 parameters: oral steroid courses, and/or off-scheduled visit because of asthma symptoms over the past 4 weeks, and/or increase of asthma symptoms from a symptom score 0 or 1 to a symptom score 2 and/or decline of FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>(L) more than 10% compared to the previous visit. <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2005</LINK> defined an exacerbation as a deterioration in symptoms requiring oral prednisone course. Shaw 2007 also used a definition of an increase in symptoms requiring oral steroids or antibiotics. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK> defined exacerbations as minor or major; a minor exacerbation was defined as a daily asthma score of 2 or more on 2 or more consecutive days, whereas a major exacerbation was a daily asthma score of 3 or more on 2 or more consecutive days. <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK> combined admissions to hospital, unscheduled visits and oral prednisone use to define an exacerbation in their study.</P>
<P>Two studies were in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK>) and four children/adult studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK>). We classified studies into children/adolescent studies based on the mean age reported as opposed to the entry criteria. Thus although <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK> study's entry criteria included young adults (up to 20 years), the mean age of the participants were 144 years (IQR 13&#8211;16) and hence included in the children/adolescent analysis.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-06-30 19:39:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>This meta-analysis based on six studies in 1053 adults and children (with 1010 completed), has showed that tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in comparison with usual traditional methods (based primarily on clinical symptoms) did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or asthma symptoms. In children/adolescents there was a trend favouring the FeNO strategy in number of participants with one or more exacerbation, but this was at the expense of higher levels of inhaled corticosteroids. In adults, the FeNO based strategy enabled a reduction in the final (but not the overall) daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids .</P>
<P>Tailoring medications based on FeNO has been advocated in editorials (<LINK REF="REF-Szefler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szefler 2005</LINK>). This Cochrane review has shown that the benefits of utilising this strategy (as opposed to standard strategy based on clinical symptoms and simple tests like FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) is at best modest and could potentially be harmful with increased ICS use in children. There was no significant difference between the two strategies in both adult and paediatric studies in the primary outcome of exacerbation, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FeNO levels or symptom control scores. The only significant beneficial difference found between groups was the final daily dose of ICS in adults. However this finding is limited as this was a post-hoc analysis. Even though the final ICS dose was lower at final visit, <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2007</LINK> reported overall higher doses of ICS in the FeNO based strategy through the duration of study and was only lower on final visit. They related this to a proportion of patients who showed an elevated FeNO that was associated with a normal eosinophil count (identified by sputum eosinophil testing as a safety measure when the dose of ICS reached 2000 mcg/day). Furthermore in children where high ICS doses are of more concern due to potential adverse events, there was a significant increase in ICS dose in the FeNO strategy arm (mean difference of 140 ug (95% CI 29 to 251) of budesonide equivalent/day). In a previous systematic review we found that there was no significant difference in doses of ICS when asthma treatment was based on sputum eosinophils, as opposed to clinical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Petsky-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petsky 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this review need to be considered in light of several issues. Firstly, all the studies except <LINK REF="STD-Szefler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szefler 2008</LINK> used a single but different cut-off level of FeNO to adjust ICS in the entire cohort, yet studies have demonstrated that FeNO is significantly influenced by atopic status (with a dose response) (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 2003</LINK>). In some studies, use of FeNO levels do not differentiate between children with and without asthma once atopy is taken into account (<LINK REF="REF-Malmberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2006</LINK>) as atopic subjects have elevated exhaled nitric oxide levels (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2006</LINK>). Other studies have shown that FeNO is independently influenced by allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Nordvall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordvall 2005</LINK>) and a 40% coefficient of variation between morning and evening FeNO with no change in symptoms has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Pijnenburg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijnenburg 2006</LINK>). None of the six included studies considered presence or severity of atopy in their algorithm of management although some but not all subjects were atopic. Shaw and colleagues reported that some of their participants were atopic (62% in FeNO group, 70% in control group). Smith et al did not describe whether their subjects were atopic or not. 'Atopic asthma' was an inclusion criteria for Pijnenburg et al as defined as RAST class 2 or higher for at least 1 airborne allergan ever. Similarly all children in Fritsch et al had an inclusion criteria of positive skin prick test or radioallergosorbent test.</P>
<P>Secondly FeNO levels are also influenced by age and height (<LINK REF="REF-Malmberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmberg 2006</LINK>) and are elevated even in well non-asthmatic adults with a acute respiratory viral infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2004</LINK>). Thus arguably one single cut-off for the entire cohort irrespective of significant biological influences of FeNO (such as atopy (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2006</LINK>) and age (<LINK REF="REF-Strunk--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strunk 2003</LINK>) would not be appropriate. However, how FeNO levels should be adjusted for these factors is currently unknown.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the cut offs of FeNO utilised for stepping up or down therapy was different between studies (ranging from 15 to 30 ppb). Pijnenburg et al (paediatric study) subjects had the highest mean daily dose of ICS and subjects in this study also had quite high FeNO at the final visit. Disconcertingly, use of FeNO strategy did not result in a lower FeNO level at the end of trial. Smith et al mentioned that their 15 ppb threshold is equivalent to 35 ppb at a slower 50 ml/second flow rate.</P>
<P>Fourthly, tailoring interventions based on exhaled nitric oxide requires a nitric oxide analyzer that needs calibration and maintenance. Nitric oxide analysers are relatively expensive and adding FeNO as a monitoring tool adds not only cost but also another layer of complexity in asthma care. Analysers have only been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration for clinical monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>). As reported in Risk of Bias table (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) obtaining accurate FeNO measurements each visit could not be obtained, either due to a faulty analyzer (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jongste-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Jongste 2009</LINK>) or technical issues (<LINK REF="STD-Fritsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsch 2006</LINK>). Also, many aspects need to be considered when analysing exhaled nitric oxide; this includes the timing of spirometry (transiently reduces FeNO), food and beverage, circadian rhythm, smoking history, ambient NO and exercise (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although tests for FeNO are non-invasive and relatively easy to obtain measurements in children (when compared with obtaining and analysing sputum), it is not clear how to tailor the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide in comparison to clinical symptoms. This is in contrast to tailoring asthma interventions based on sputum eosinophils where it is beneficial in reducing the frequency of asthma exacerbations in adults with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Petsky-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petsky 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of review</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review is limited to six studies with only 1010 subjects completing the trials. While the studies share some common issues, there are also significant differences, notably, the definition of asthma exacerbation, the cut off levels for FeNO were different, the control strategy and the steps for tailoring medications.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-06-30 19:39:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The studies included in this review highlight the difficulties involved in tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide, instead of primarily on clinical symptoms. At present this approach cannot be advocated as routine clinical practice. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-06-30 19:39:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Further RCT's in both adults and children with groups with other significant influences of FeNO taken into account (such as atopy) are required. A-priori pragmatic issues of clinical practice such as high vs low doses of ICS and to a lesser extent eosinophilic vs non-eosinophilic asthma should be considered with costs analysis for each sub-group. The design of future RCT's should preferably be parallel multi-centre studies and include outcomes of exacerbations, subjective measures (such as scores for asthma control and quality of life) as well as objective measures (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> etc). Analysis of costs and possible adverse events of inhaled and oral corticosteroids would also provide additional important information.</P>
