<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-15 10:16:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormonal contraceptives have been related to bone changes in women. Whether such changes lead to more bone fractures later in life is not clear. However, bone health is a major public health concern. Bone density declines with age, and the change increases the risk of fracture. Due to concern about bone health, health care providers may not suggest hormonal contraceptives and women may not want to use them.</P>
<P>Through April 2014, we did computer searches for studies of birth control methods containing hormones and risk of fractures. Outcomes could also be bone mineral density or markers of bone changes. Birth control pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. Also included were implants and injectables with only progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in any language that had at least three treatment cycles. The studies had to compare two types of birth control or one type of birth control or a supplement with a placebo or 'dummy' method.</P>
<P>We found 19 trials. Fifteen studies compared one birth control method with another hormone method. Two trials used a placebo or 'dummy.' One compared a hormone method to a method without hormones. None had fractures as an outcome and most looked at bone density. Birth control methods with both estrogen and progestin did not appear to affect bone health. However, 'depo,' which is injected and has only progestin, was related to lower bone density. The two depo trials with placebos showed increased bone density when some estrogen was given to women on depo. Bone density decreased in women who got a 'dummy' with the depo. Whether this decrease is important to the woman's health is not known. For implants, an etonogestrel implant with one rod showed a greater decrease in bone density than a two-rod levonorgestrel implant. However, other implants studied did not show the same pattern.</P>
<P>The studies had data of moderate quality. Whether hormonal contraceptives affect fracture risk cannot be judged from current information. These contraceptive methods work well for birth control. Health-care providers and women should think about the costs and benefits. For instance, injectable use can occur without a partner's knowledge, and is simpler than taking pills every day. Also, progestin-only methods are suggested for some women with health problems who should avoid estrogen.</P>

<P>Steroidal contraceptive use has been associated with changes in bone mineral density in women. Whether such changes increase the risk of fractures later in life is not clear. Osteoporosis is a major public health concern. Age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of fracture, especially of the spine, hip, and wrist. Concern about bone health influences the recommendation and use of these effective contraceptives globally.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-02-19 16:00:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our aim was to evaluate the effect of using hormonal contraceptives before menopause on the risk of fracture in women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-05-15 10:16:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Through April 2014, we searched for studies of fracture or bone health and hormonal contraceptives in MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of relevant articles for other trials. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-19 16:02:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered if they examined fractures, bone mineral density (BMD), or bone turnover markers in women with hormonal contraceptive use prior to menopause. Eligible interventions included comparisons of a hormonal contraceptive with a placebo or with another hormonal contraceptive that differed in terms of drug, dosage, or regimen. They also included providing a supplement to one group.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-20 14:11:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed all titles and abstracts identified through the literature searches. Mean differences were computed using the inverse variance approach. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Both included the 95% confidence interval (CI) and used a fixed-effect model. Due to differing interventions, no trials could be combined for meta-analysis. We applied principles from GRADE to assess the evidence quality and address confidence in the effect estimates. In addition, a sensitivity analysis included trials that provided sufficient data for this review and evidence of at least moderate quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-03 14:41:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We found 19 RCTs that met our eligibility criteria. Eleven trials compared different combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or regimens of COCs; five examined an injectable versus another injectable, implant, or IUD; two studied implants, and one compared the transdermal patch versus the vaginal ring. No trial had fracture as an outcome. BMD was measured in 17 studies and 12 trials assessed biochemical markers of bone turnover. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) was associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD). The placebo-controlled trials showed BMD increases for DMPA plus estrogen supplement and decreases for DMPA plus placebo supplement. COCs did not appear to negatively affect BMD, and some formulations had more positive effects than others. However, no COC trial was placebo-controlled. Where studies showed differences between groups in bone turnover markers, the results were generally consistent with those for BMD. For implants, the single-rod etonogestrel group showed a greater BMD decrease versus the two-rod levonorgestrel group but results were not consistent across all implant comparisons.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis included 11 trials providing evidence of moderate or high quality. Four trials involving DMPA showed some positive effects of an estrogen supplement on BMD, a negative effect of DMPA-subcutaneous on lumbar spine BMD, and a negative effect of DMPA on a bone formation marker. Of the three COC trials, one had a BMD decrease for the group with gestodene plus EE 15 &#956;g. Another indicated less bone resorption in the group with gestodene plus EE 30 &#956;g versus EE 20 &#956;g.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-25 10:26:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. The evidence quality was considered moderate overall, largely due to the trials of DMPA, implants, and the patch versus ring. The COC evidence varied in quality but was low overall. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. For example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. Progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-19 12:23:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Steroidal contraceptives, particularly injectable contraceptives and combined oral contraceptives (COCs), have been associated with changes in bone mineral density in women. Whether such changes increase the risk of fractures later in life is not clear. However, osteoporosis is a major public health concern. Age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of fracture, especially of the spine, hip, and wrist (<LINK REF="REF-Howe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rachner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachner 2011</LINK>). The costs of osteoporosis-related fractures can be substantial for the individual due to disability and to society for health and social care (<LINK REF="REF-Howe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howe 2011</LINK>). Concern about bone health influences the recommendation and use of these effective contraceptives globally.</P>
<P>Skeletal fragility results from suboptimal formation of bone mass and strength, as well as excess bone resorption (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raisz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raisz 2005</LINK>). Bone loss during contraceptive use may be temporary like that which occurs during pregnancy or breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Gourlay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourlay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2008</LINK>). Risk of future fractures after contraceptive use depends on whether the bone mass is restored. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)</HEADING>
<P>DMPA is an effective contraceptive and the most widely-used injectable (<LINK REF="REF-Bartz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartz 2011</LINK>). Data from developing countries showed median failure rates of 2.4% for injectables versus 10.3% for condoms and 6.5% for pills (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2004</LINK>). First-year failure rates for DMPA in the USA have been estimated at 0.2% for perfect use and 6% for typical use (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>). If injectable use were limited due to concerns about effects on bone health, women might switch to less effective methods or use nothing, which could lead to increased pregnancy rates.</P>
<P>Of the injectable contraceptives, DMPA has attracted the most attention regarding bone health. DMPA may reduce bone mineral density (BMD), which is a potential concern for younger women who have not yet achieved peak bone mass. Early research indicated more bone loss among women who used DMPA before 20 years of age and those who used it for longer periods (<LINK REF="REF-Cundy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cundy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholes 1999</LINK>). More recently, two case-control studies reported increased fracture risk for longer current use of DMPA (<LINK REF="REF-Vestergaard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vestergaard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 2010</LINK>), although past users had little evidence of increased risk (<LINK REF="REF-Meier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the US, the Food and Drug Administration requires a warning on DMPA labeling (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK>). It refers to BMD loss among DMPA users, especially younger women. The warning is based on limited evidence and may limit long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2011</LINK>). Major health organizations have recommended not restricting DMPA use among women 18 to 45 years old (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guilbert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilbert 2009</LINK>). In guidance about medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, DMPA is category 1 (no restriction) for women aged 18 to 45 years (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). For women outside that age range, DMPA is category 2, meaning the advantages generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.</P>

Failure rates for oral contraceptives in the USA (combined and progestin-only) are estimated at 0.3% for perfect use and 9% for typical use in the first year (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few associations have been noted between OC use and fracture risk in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2012</LINK>). A cohort study found OC ever-users had increased risk for all fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1993</LINK>). However, a case-control study, with later data from a subset, reported no association except for those with 10 years or more since use (<LINK REF="REF-Memon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Memon 2011</LINK>). Another case-control study reported increased risk, but only for those who had 10 or more prescriptions (<LINK REF="REF-Meier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 2010</LINK>). A cohort study of postmenopausal women found no increased fracture risk for OC use after excluding women with prior fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Barad-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barad 2005</LINK>). Two other studies found little evidence of association between OC use and fracture risk. A cohort study noted increased risk for subgroups, such as those with longer use or specific intervals since use (<LINK REF="REF-Vessey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vessey 1998</LINK>). A case-control study reported increased risk for any fracture only among young women with less than average use (<LINK REF="REF-Vestergaard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vestergaard 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>COCs may have little effect on BMD among healthy adult women. Prospective studies have indicated that ultra-low dose COCs, containing 20 &#956;g ethinyl estradiol, may affect bone development in young women (<LINK REF="REF-Cromer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cromer 2003</LINK>). On the other hand, COCs with 30 to 40 &#956;g ethinyl estradiol may have no negative effect and may even protect against bone loss, at least among women 30 years of age or more (<LINK REF="REF-Cromer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cromer 2003</LINK>). Evidence from studies of varying designs indicates that BMD may be affected by COC use in adolescent and young women but not in adult premenopausal or postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Martins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warholm-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warholm 2012</LINK>). However, COC use may have a negative effect on bone turnover markers, although the clinical significance of such change is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-19 12:19:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormonal contraceptives are among the most effective and most widely-used contraceptives. Concern about fractures may limit the use of these effective contraceptives. Women might switch to less effective methods or use nothing, potentially leading to increased rates of unintended pregnancy. The question about an association between steroidal contraceptives and fractures is important to examine systematically with the available evidence. Since our initial review in 2006, we also examined evidence of actual fracture risk in observational studies of hormonal contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2012</LINK>). In this update, we further examine the effect of using steroidal contraceptives before menopause on general bone health, based on evidence from randomized controlled trials.</P>

<P>We summarized the results by contraceptive method and composition (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Two studies of DMPA plus a supplement were placebo-controlled, and one study compared a combination injectable to a non-hormonal IUD. Since the estrogen preparations and routes of administration differed for the DMPA trials, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Nonetheless, the two trials showed BMD increases for the women who received DMPA plus estrogen supplement and decreases for those who had DMPA plus placebo supplement. In the combination injectable study, BMD changes were modest but the losses were too high for results to be informative.</P>
<P>Most trials compared two different hormonal contraceptives. Combination oral contraceptives did not appear to negatively affect bone density, and some formulations had more positive effects than others. However, none were placebo-controlled. Where trials showed differences between groups in biochemical markers of bone formation, the results were generally consistent with those for bone mineral density. For the progestin-only implants, two trials studied different implants, used different sites for measuring BMD, and had varying durations. One study showed a greater decrease in BMD for the etonogestrel-implant group than the two-rod levonorgestrel group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence, as discussed below (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Our sensitivity analysis had 11 trials that provided sufficient data for the outcome and evidence of moderate or high quality (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). These included the four DMPA studies, the two implant trials, the combination injectable and patch versus study, but only 3 of the 11 COC trials. The results were similar to those for the review overall. Of the four DMPA-IM trials, two showed a positive effect of an estrogen supplement on BMD, one had a negative effect of DMPA-SC on lumbar spine BMD, and the fourth indicated a negative effect of DMPA-IM on a bone formation marker. The two implant studies each had one significant difference in BMD out of several measures. Of the three COC trials, two examined BMD, of which one showed a decrease for the group with gestodene plus EE 15 &#956;g. Of the two that used biochemical measures, one indicated less bone resorption in the group with gestodene plus EE 30 &#956;g versus EE 20 &#956;g. No significant differences were noted in the trials of the combination injectable or the patch versus ring.</P>

<P>None of the studies included fracture as an outcome. Longer follow up would be needed for meaningful assessment of fracture. Since fragility fractures are rare in young people, fracture is not usually an outcome in studies of premenopausal bone health (<LINK REF="REF-Gourlay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourlay 2004</LINK>). Researchers and clinicians may have to rely on bone mineral density and biochemical measures of bone health. BMD correlates with fracture but is not a valid surrogate endpoint for fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2010</LINK>). BMD is considered useful in screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, its validity in assessing risk is still unclear for premenopausal women, including those using steroidal contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>). International organizations have recommended using bone turnover markers rather than BMD for monitoring treatment of osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Vasikaran-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasikaran 2011a</LINK>). In this review, markers of bone formation included serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and type I procollagen; bone resorption indicators included serum calcium and C-telopeptide as well as urinary pyridinoline and N-telopeptides. Recommended reference markers are serum procollagen type I N propeptide, s-PINP (bone formation); and serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen, s-CTX (bone resorption) (<LINK REF="REF-Vasikaran-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasikaran 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasikaran-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasikaran 2011b</LINK>). Decreases in these markers correlate better than others with reduction in fracture risk. However, the relationship of hormonal contraceptive use and bone health is less well understood (<LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methodological differences limited the analysis and interpretation of the data. Due to the differing interventions studied, no trials were combined for meta-analysis. Studies compared COCs with different formulations, two types of implants, injectables with other methods, and the skin patch with the vaginal ring. Such differences in treatments limit the conclusions about any one contraceptive method.</P>
<P>Of 19 studies, only 3 were limited to adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Cromer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cromer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gai-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gai 2012</LINK>); a fourth focused on young women (<LINK REF="STD-Hartard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hartard 2006</LINK>). Three of those four trials showed some differences between study groups in BMD or bone turnover markers, compared to 7 of the 15 studies with older women. Adolescents are rapidly acquiring bone mass (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>). Whether COCs affect the development of peak bone mass is unclear, though COCs with less than 30 &#956;g EE may be a concern (<LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>). DMPA may affect BMD in adolescents, but some studies have indicated a return to baseline after discontinuation (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>). More studies focused on adolescents and younger women would be useful. However, placebo-controlled trials in contraception are limited for ethical reasons, especially among a population at high risk for unplanned pregnancy.</P>

<P>As noted earlier, we refined our criteria to identify the specific risk of bias issues in 2014 (<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). For this review, the evidence quality was considered moderate overall (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The DMPA studies provided moderate quality evidence. The quality of the COC evidence varied widely, but was considered low overall. The quality was moderate to high for the studies of implants, combination injectable, and patch versus ring.</P>
<P>Limitations of these studies include incomplete or no description of sequence generation and allocation concealment, lack of blinding, and high losses. Some reports did not have sufficient data for assessment; outcomes were presented in tables without absolute numbers. For losses, we could not always distinguish between losses to follow up or discontinuation. Therefore, we included all losses in our assessment. About half of the trials had high losses, so the results may not represent randomized comparisons. As noted earlier, losses greater than 20% can bias the results and threaten trial validity (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>). At least three trials lost more than half the participants and some had differential losses between the comparison groups.</P>

<P>A review of observational studies did not indicate an overall association between OC use and fracture risk, except for some increased risk among specific user subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2012</LINK>).

BMD in adolescent and young women may be affected by the use of COCs with lower estrogen doses, i.e., 20 &#956;g (<LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>).

<P>Of progestin-only methods, DMPA has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (<LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>). However, no published RCT has linked DMPA use with fracture later in life. A review of observational studies had two case-control studies in the sensitivity analysis that examined DMPA (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2012</LINK>). One of the studies reported increased fracture risk for DMPA ever-use, more than four years of use, and women over 50 years of age. The other noted increased risk for any past DMPA use and for current use of 3 or more prescriptions. A loss of BMD during adolescence may be recovered after discontinuing DMPA (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nappi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nappi 2012</LINK>).

<P>Whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. Combination contraceptives do not appear to negatively affect bone mineral density or bone turnover markers. Of progestin-only methods, DMPA may alter bone mineral density. Whether DMPA affects fracture risk cannot be determined, as no randomized trial assessed fracture. Health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. The advantages of DMPA outweigh concerns about fracture risk for adolescents and for women over 45 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Injectable contraceptives may be appropriate for women who want long-term birth control without a daily regimen. Other candidates for progestin-only contraceptives are women with contraindications to estrogen use.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-20 08:03:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional trials of estrogen supplementation with progestin-only contraceptives would provide more evidence regarding any effect on bone health. Many trials had limitations for interpretation, including small numbers of participants and large losses. Stronger evidence is needed to make recommendations for clinical practice. Trials of longer duration could provide information on whether there was any reversal of earlier decreases in BMD. Studies could focus on adolescents, who have not yet reached peak bone mass, and on perimenopausal women, who may be losing bone mass. Results of such trials could help determine if these two groups are at greater risk of adverse outcomes due to the effects of progestin.</P>
