<TITLE>Over-the-counter medications to help reduce cough for children and adults on antibiotics for acute pneumonia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-28 14:27:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many causes of acute cough, one of which is pneumonia. Cough is burdensome and impairs quality of life. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are commonly purchased and used by patients, and are recommended by healthcare staff as additional medications in the treatment of pneumonia. There are many classes of OTC medications for cough, such as mucolytics (medications that can reduce the thickness of mucus) and antitussives (medications that suppress cough). This review aims to balance the possible benefits of these agents with their potential risks.</P>
<P>In this review we found four studies with a total of 224 participants that were suitable for inclusion; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. However, data could only be obtained from two studies; both studies used mucolytics (ambroxol and bromhexine) in conjunction with antibiotics. Combining these two studies, the rate of cure or improvement in cough of people who received mucolytics was similar to those who did not. However, in the secondary analysis, children who received a mucolytic were more likely to be cured of cough (the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) at day 10 was 5 for children and 4 for adults). There were no reported increased adverse events in the treatment group.</P>
<P>The range of possible adverse events associated with OTC medications for cough is wide and includes minimal adverse events (such as with the use of honey) to serious adverse events, such as altered heart rate patterns, drowsiness and death in young children. The studies included in this review did not report any detectable increase in adverse events. There were no obvious biases in the studies.</P>
<P>This review has substantial limitations due to the unavailability of data from studies. Also there are no studies of other common OTC medications used for cough, such as antihistamines and antitussives. </P>
<P>Thus, there is insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions on the role of OTC medications taken as an additional treatment for cough associated with acute pneumonia. Mucolytics may be beneficial but the lack of consistent evidence precludes recommending the routine use of mucolytics as an addition in the treatment of troublesome cough associated with pneumonia in children or adults. The evidence is current to January 2014.</P>

<P>Cough is often distressing for patients with pneumonia. Accordingly they often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications (mucolytics or cough suppressants). These might provide relief in reducing cough severity, but suppression of the cough mechanism might impede airway clearance and cause harm.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-28 14:25:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no new trials to include in this review update. Previously, four studies with a total of 224 participants were included; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. One using an antitussive had no extractable pneumonia-specific data. Three different mucolytics (bromhexine, ambroxol, neltenexine) were used in the remaining studies, of which only two had extractable data. They demonstrated no significant difference for the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' for mucolytics. A secondary outcome of 'not cured' was reduced (odds ratio (OR) for children 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.77; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) at day 10 = 5 (95% CI 3 to 16) and OR 0.32 for adults (95% CI 0.13 to 0.75); NNTB at day 10 = 5 (95% CI 3 to 19)). In a post hoc analysis combining data for children and adults, again there was no difference in the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.80) although mucolytics reduced the secondary outcome 'not cured' (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 8). The risk of bias was low or unclear.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-31 10:52:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to decide whether OTC medications for cough associated with acute pneumonia are beneficial. Mucolytics may be beneficial but there is insufficient evidence to recommend them as an adjunctive treatment for acute pneumonia. This leaves only theoretical recommendations that OTC medications containing codeine and antihistamines should not be used in young children.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-10 15:12:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-06 23:25:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to general practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2003</LINK>). Acute cough (duration less than two weeks) (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006</LINK>) has multiple causes, including pneumonia. Whatever the cause, attempting to reduce the impact of the symptom of cough is reflected in the billions spent on over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications. Cough impairs quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-French-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2002</LINK>) and causes significant anxiety to the parents of children (<LINK REF="REF-Cornford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornford 1993</LINK>). Accordingly, patients with pneumonia sometimes self medicate with over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications in ambulatory settings, or ask for them in hospital.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-28 14:40:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane review showed that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestion combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children with the common cold but not in young children (<LINK REF="REF-de-Sutter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Sutter 2012</LINK>). In the management of acute cough, in the ambulatory setting, a Cochrane review found no good evidence for or against the use of OTC medications (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>). There is no clear benefit of antihistamines (either singly or in combination) in young children for relieving acute cough (<LINK REF="REF-de-Sutter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Sutter 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>). Moreover, they are associated with potentially significant adverse events including altered consciousness, arrhythmia and death (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>). None of these reviews included patients with pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>). There are also Cochrane reviews on chronic non-specific cough but this is unrelated to this review, which focuses on acute cough associated with pneumonia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-10 15:12:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cough is usually divided into acute or chronic according to its duration and age group. It is defined as chronic if over eight weeks duration in adults, and over three to four weeks in children (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2005</LINK>). This reflects the different conditions causing chronic cough in different age groups. In contrast, in this review we examined the efficacy of OTC medication for acute cough in acute pneumonia, where the pathophysiological processes (albeit poorly understood) are likely to be the same in children and adults. Methods for determining cough outcomes are similar in adults and children, although these methods remain poorly standardised. Objective measurements of cough include cough frequency and cough sensitivity outcomes, whilst subjective measurements of cough may broadly encompass quality-of-life and outcomes based on diaries etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Birring-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birring 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-01 11:20:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although OTC cough medications might provide some relief by reducing the severity of the cough, they might also be harmful in prolonging pneumonia (by suppressing the cough reflex, which might cause retention of airway debris). Thus, a systematic review of their benefits or harms is useful to help guide clinical practice.</P>

<P>In the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2007</LINK>), the search identified 238 potentially relevant titles. After reviewing the abstracts, we obtained 21 full-text papers, included four studies and excluded 17 papers (details are in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table). Most were non-randomised studies or performed without a placebo. A review article was identified in this search (<LINK REF="STD-Ida-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ida 1997</LINK>) which described three studies of dimemorfan (a dextromethorphan analogue) not identified using the original search strategy. One of these three studies was described as a placebo-controlled trial. Unfortunately we were not able to obtain this and there was insufficient details provided in the review article (<LINK REF="STD-Ida-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ida 1997</LINK>). Another review paper (<LINK REF="STD-Mancini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mancini 1996</LINK>) described three studies, of which one appeared to include patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection (specified as acute bronchitis or bronchoalveolitis but which may have included patients with pneumonia). We attempted to contact the trial authors but were not able to extract data on the subgroup of patients with pneumonia, and thus we excluded the study from further analysis.</P>
<P>In the 2009 update (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2010</LINK>), we identified two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Balli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Balli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Titti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Titti 2000</LINK>) on erdosteine (a mucolytic agent) but these were excluded as this is not readily accessible over the counter (details added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table). In the 2011 and 2013 updates, we identified 32 and 49 potential studies respectively but none fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of note, a study which examined the role of zinc supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Basnet-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Basnet 2012</LINK>) was excluded as this is not an OTC drug for cough suppression and cough was not an outcome measure (details added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, thus totalling to 20 excluded studies in this current update).</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2014-02-06 23:42:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies were included, as described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table; all were available in English. However, data specific for pneumonia were only available in two papers (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>). Authors of three papers did not respond to our correspondence requesting for further pneumonia-specific data.</P>
<P>Of the included studies, one study was exclusively in children (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>), two were exclusively in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Aquilina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aquilina 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK>) and one included adolescents and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>One study utilised an antitussive (Dimyril) (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK>) and three of the studies examined the efficacy of different formulations of mucolytics (bromhexine (<LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>), neltenexine (<LINK REF="STD-Aquilina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aquilina 2001</LINK>) and ambroxol (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>)). In two of these studies, the concomitant antibiotics used were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Two studies were multicentre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>), for which the funding was unspecified. Two studies were single-centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aquilina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aquilina 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK>). One study was a controlled non-placebo study (<LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>) and the rest utilised a randomised placebo-controlled design (<LINK REF="STD-Aquilina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aquilina 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>). All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK>) used a parallel design. </P>
<P>The inclusion and exclusion criteria (that is, including the definition of pneumonia) varied between the studies; only one study was exclusively in patients with pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>, bacterial pneumonia was defined as the presence of recent productive phlegm, fever or leucocytosis (&gt; 10,000 mm<SUP>3</SUP>) and pulmonary infiltrates on radiographic examination. In <LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>, inclusion required either a positive blood culture for a well-defined bacterium or a chest X-ray showing lobar or sub lobar involvement together with raised inflammatory markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate &#8805; 30 mm/h and C-reactive protein &#8805; 25 &#956;g/mL. The two smaller papers (<LINK REF="STD-Aquilina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aquilina 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK>) which contributed rather fewer numbers to the analysis did not clearly define pneumonia.</P>
<P>The outcomes of the studies also varied and none utilised a validated scale for cough. The larger trials were performed and published 12 and 21 years ago, respectively, and so were not methodologically as robust as one would expect of current-day trials (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK> trial evaluated clinical response, bacteriological response and each clinical symptom using a visual analogue scale. Both clinical and bacteriological responses had clearly defined definitions; they defined cure as complete disappearance of pretreatment signs and symptoms, and improvement as an improvement on the visual analogue scale but less than cure. <LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK> evaluated clinical and radiological signs and used absolute numbers and severity scores to evaluate clinical symptoms and signs, including cough. The <LINK REF="STD-Aquilina-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aquilina 2001</LINK> trial used severity scores on prespecified examination days and at the end of therapy; the investigator expressed an overall assessment of the therapeutic efficacy. The <LINK REF="STD-Azzopardi-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Azzopardi 1964</LINK> trial was more obviously subjective in its evaluation.</P>

<P>In previous reviews, the agreement between the review authors for the scores was good: the weighted Kappa score for the quality assessment scale was 0.63. In the updated 2011 version we completed a 'Risk of bias' table (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Generally, there were no glaring biases in the included studies - the majority of parameters were assessed as low-risk or unclear risk. There were no high-risk biases identified. Specifically the method used for sequence generation and whether allocation was concealed were not clear in all the studies. However the blinding of participants and outcomes seemed reasonable.</P>

For <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK> ('not improved'), the non-significant difference was also unaltered but the OR changed to 0.72 (95% CI 0.21 to 2.29). For <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK> ('not cured'), the significant difference between groups was also preserved and there was no difference in the OR or 95% CI (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60), NNTB 4 (95% CI 3 to 8), favouring those on a mucolytic.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-02-06 23:25:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only a few studies have examined over-the-counter (OTC) medications for cough related to pneumonia.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-06 23:25:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although four studies were included in this review, only data from two studies could be used (<LINK REF="STD-Principi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roa 1995</LINK>). Both of these studies examined the efficacy of a mucolytic as an adjunct in the management of pneumonia and used cough as the principal outcome. For the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved', there was no difference between groups when we considered children and adults separately, or when we combined data in a post hoc analysis. However, for one of the secondary outcomes ('not cured') the use of a mucolytic increased the cure rate similarly in both children and adults (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 5). Therefore, we cannot be confident of its efficacy. Nevertheless, based on <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, if a mucolytic is tried then the time to response (that is, the "expected timeframe to which a significant improvement is seen" (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006</LINK>)), is three days. However, these data come from only a single study.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-02-06 23:25:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>OTC medications for cough consist of a variety of drugs used as sole agents or in combination. These drugs include antitussives (such as codeine derivatives), antihistamines and non-pharmaceutical medications (for example, menthol) (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2002</LINK>). However, it is also possible that non-pharmaceutical additives used (such as sugar, alcohol) may have a therapeutic effect, such that the placebo effect of medications for cough has been reported to be as high as 85% (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2002</LINK>). Thus, it is not surprising that although the total sample size for the combined studies was not small (N = 224), there was no effect seen for the primary outcome. Given that there was a significant difference between groups, further evaluation of mucolytics using more robust outcomes (as outlined in the '<LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>') is certainly warranted.</P>
<P>Although adverse events were uncommon in the clinical trials identified in this study, there are case reports of severe adverse events, including severe morbidity and even death (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-02-06 23:25:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the lack of evidence, the routine use of over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications in treating children or adults with troublesome cough associated with pneumonia cannot be recommended. Of those tested, mucolytics are the only type of OTC medication that have been shown to be possibly efficacious. The 'time to response' (subjective cough severity) is three days when used as an adjunct to an appropriate antibiotic. In current practice it is recommended that young children are not given OTC cough medications containing codeine derivatives and antihistamines because of the known adverse events of these medications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-12-14 23:20:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of OTC medications to determine their effectiveness in treating cough associated with pneumonia are clearly needed. Current guidelines advocate that studies of antitussives should take place in patients with a clearly defined clinical entity, such as pneumonia. Trials should be parallel studies and double-blinded, given the known problems in studying cough, specifically the large placebo and time period effects. Clinical, radiological and bacteriological responses should be objectively evaluated. Based on the above data, a short trial of seven days would suffice. Outcome measures for the clinical studies on cough should be clearly defined using validated subjective data and supported by objective data, if possible.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>In addition to antibiotics, people with pneumonia often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications when at home or request OTC cough medications when in hospital to suppress an annoying cough. There is a question as to whether suppressing cough may prolong pneumonia. Over-the-counter cough medications can include antitussives, expectorants, antihistamine-decongestants, antihistamines and mucolytics (such as bromhexine, ambroxol and neltenexine).</P>
