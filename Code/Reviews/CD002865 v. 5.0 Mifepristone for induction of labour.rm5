<P>Not enough evidence on the effects of mifepristone (RU 486) to induce labour.</P>
<P>The female sex hormone, progesterone stops the uterus contracting during pregnancy. Drugs such as mifepristone have been used to stop the action of this hormone, either to induce labour or to allow the pregnancy to be terminated. The review of ten trials (1108 women) found there is not enough evidence to support the use of mifepristone to induce labour. There is little information about adverse effects for the mother or baby. However, there is evidence that mifepristone can reduce the need for a caesarean so further research is needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-08 12:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Ten trials (1108 women) are included. Compared to placebo, mifepristone treated women were more likely to be in labour or to have a favourable cervix at 48 hours (risk ratio (RR) 2.41, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.70 to 3.42) and this effect persisted at 96 hours (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.96 to 5.92). They were less likely to need augmentation with oxytocin (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). Mifepristone treated women were less likely to undergo caesarean section (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92) but more likely to have an instrumental delivery (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.96). Women receiving mifepristone were less likely to undergo a caesarean section as a result of failure to induce labour (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.80). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular dose but a single dose of 200 mg mifepristone appears to be the lowest effective dose for cervical ripening (increased likelihood of cervical ripening at 72 hours (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.97). Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns were more common after mifepristone treatment (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.93), but there was no evidence of differences in other neonatal outcomes. There is insufficient information on the occurrence of uterine rupture/dehiscence in the reviewed studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-08 12:44:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>There is insufficient information available from clinical trials to support the use of mifepristone to induce labour. However, the studies suggest that mifepristone is better than placebo in reducing the likelihood of caesarean sections being performed for failed induction of labour; therefore, this may justify future trials comparing mifepristone with the routine cervical ripening agents currently in use. There is little information on effects on the baby.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-13 14:33:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:03:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The female steroid sex hormone, progesterone, inhibits contractility of the uterus. A new class of pharmacological agents (antiprogestins) has been developed to antagonise the action of progesterone. Of these, mifepristone (also called RU 486) is best known. Mifepristone is a 19 nor-steroid which has greater affinity for progesterone receptors than does progesterone itself. It thus blocks the action of progesterone at the cellular level. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone are characterised by rapid absorption and a long half-life of 25 to 30 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Heikinheimo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikinheimo 1997</LINK>). Key metabolites also have high affinity to progesterone receptors.</P>
<P>Mifepristone now has an established role in termination of pregnancy (in combination with prostaglandins) during the early first, and the second trimesters (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Look-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Look 1995</LINK>). Mifepristone is also being investigated as a possible contraceptive agent (both for planned and emergency contraception) (<LINK REF="REF-Hapangama-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hapangama 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mifepristone has potential also as a method of inducing labour in late pregnancy through its actions in antagonising progesterone, thus increasing uterine contractility and by increasing the sensitivity of the uterus to the actions of prostaglandins. Mifepristone has been shown to induce labour in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Fang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fang 1997</LINK>), through opposition to progesterone-induced suppression of oxytocin receptors, and enhanced synthesis of prostaglandins. Mifepristone has also been shown to induce preterm birth in mice, associated with a rise in prostaglandins and cyokines (<LINK REF="REF-Dudley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudley 1996</LINK>). A randomised-controlled trial in beef heifers found a mean time to delivery of 43 hours after mifepristone administration, compared to 182 hours in placebo treated controls (<LINK REF="REF-Dlamini-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dlamini 1995</LINK>); interestingly, retained placenta was a problem in the experimental group. In a primate model (the macaque), mifepristone administration induced prostaglandin F2alpha production by decidua, but not prostaglandin E2 production by amnion (<LINK REF="REF-Haluska-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haluska 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In women, mifepristone combined with subsequent prostaglandins is also being commonly used for labour induction after fetal death in later pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Fairley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairley 2005</LINK>). The data from women undergoing termination of early pregnancy have shown that mifepristone is more effective in nulliparous women (<LINK REF="REF-Bartley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartley 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is, thus, reason to anticipate from animal studies and termination studies in human pregnancies that mifepristone might prove an effective method of inducing labour in late human pregnancy.</P>
<P>This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the published generic protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003b</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-05-08 12:51:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Subgroup analyses were limited to the primary outcomes:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components will be explored as secondary outcomes (<I>see</I> below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without fetal heart rate changes;<BR/>(9) uterine dehiscence/rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium-stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score less than seven at five minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side effects;<BR/>(19) nausea;<BR/>(20) vomiting;<BR/>(21) diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In these reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (&gt; 5 contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability).</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis if: reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias, and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-13 14:33:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, in many different subgroups with particular characteristics such as nulliparous women, or those with ruptured membranes. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged by category of woman, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We therefore developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction was carried out in a series of reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. For the methods used when assessing the trials identified in the previous version of this review,<I> see</I> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 27. Each primary review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 27) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, this review of mifepristone will include only comparisons with interventions 1 to 14 (placebo - oral prostaglandins). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>

<P>Details of the studies are listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Doses of mifepristone varied in different trials. Most studies compared mifepristone with placebo.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-05-08 11:07:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials, that recruited 1108 women, are included. Eight trials compared mifepristone with placebo, one compared mifepristone with no treatment, and another compared mifepristone with oxytocin.</P>
<P>There is evidence, from the trials, that mifepristone does induce both ripening of the cervix, and labour. Compared to placebo, mifepristone treated women were more likely to be in labour or to have a favourable cervix at 48 hours (risk ratio (RR) 2.41, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.70 to 3.42) and this effect was persisted at 72 (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.40) and 96 hours (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.96 to 5.92). They were less likely to need augmentation with oxytocin (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). There are data on caesarean section rates from all ten included trials. Mifepristone treated women were less likely to undergo caesarean section (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92) but more likely to have an instrumental delivery (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.96). It was of further interest that women receiving mifepristone were less likely to undergo a caesarean section as a result of failure to induce labour (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.80). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular dose but a single dose of 200 mg mifepristone appears to be the lowest effective dose for cervical ripening (increased likelihood of cervical ripening at 72 hours (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.97). Not all studies reported on fetal outcome, although abnormal fetal heart rate patterns were more common after mifepristone treatment (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.93), although there was no evidence of differences in admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.71) or of neonates having Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.24 to1.74). There was no evidence that neonatal hypoglycaemia might be more common after exposure to mifepristone (it antagonises the action of glucocorticoids as well as progesterone), (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.57). The incidence of all reported adverse events was higher in women receiving mifepristone than placebo (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.15) however, these seem to be mainly minor gastro-intestinal upsets (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting). A further study (Wing 2003) has compared the use of mifepristone to oxytocin in inducing labour in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks with prelabour rupture of membranes and women after mifepristone were less likely to have a vaginal delivery within 24 hours (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88) and their babies had an increased likelihood of neonatal adverse outcomes with more NICU admissions (RR 4.83, 95% CI 1.20 to 19.44), and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns (RR 5.63, 95% CI 1.11 to 28.52). There is insufficient information on the occurrence of uterine rupture/dehiscence particularly when used in women who had previously undergone a caesarean section in the reviewed studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-07 14:49:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>However, available data do show that mifepristone is better than placebo at ripening the cervix or inducing labour. There is evidence of a possible reduction in the incidence of caesarean section following mifepristone treatment (compared to placebo) that would justify further trials. There are no trial data that we have found (except for the one trial comparing mifepristone to oxytocin which did not show an advantage of mifepristone over oxytocin) that compare mifepristone with other methods of suitable cervical ripening/labour induction, e.g. prostaglandins. Any such comparison should assess formally the views of women recruited. If, for example, mifepristone were to produce less rapid onset of labour, but a process more akin to natural labour, then that might generate either frustration or satisfaction.</P>
<P>Theoretically, mifepristone has appeal as a method of inducing labour in women with previous caesarean section (if that is deemed important) as it does not involve administering exogenous oxytocic drugs that have the potential to over-stimulate, and even rupture, the uterus. More work is this area may be justified. A single-dose therapy of 200 mg is likely to be the preferred dose for such trial.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2009-05-08 13:00:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">Methods used to assess trials included in the previous version of this review</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-08 13:01:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Information is extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process is completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examines the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These are then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias is examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials, i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels is sought.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data are included in the analysis if they meet the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data are processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Collaboration Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials are analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis is performed if possible). Where data are missing, clarification is sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data are excluded from the analysis. This decision rests with the authors of primary reviews and is clearly documented. Once missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data are extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting is poor, methodological issues are reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction is not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors is therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data have been extracted, they are distributed to individual authors for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals are calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results are pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis include all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.<BR/>
<BR/>Primary analysis is limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these are analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>
