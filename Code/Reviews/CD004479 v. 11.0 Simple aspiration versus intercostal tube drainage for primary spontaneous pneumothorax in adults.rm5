<P>
<B>Why is this comparison important?</B>
</P>
<P>Air that collects between the lung and the chest wall (the pleural space) is described as a pneumothorax. A pneumothorax may be caused by trauma or lung disease, but sometimes it happens spontaneously and has no obvious cause. When this happens, the lungs cannot expand properly, making it difficult to breathe effectively. The person can become breathless and may have chest pain. It is important to treat the pneumothorax by removing collected air and allowing healing of the pleura - a thin membrane that covers the lungs and acts as a lining for them within the chest. For initial management when medical intervention is needed, air can be removed by drawing it out through a thin tube (simple aspiration), or by inserting a much larger chest tube into the space between the ribs (intercostal tube drainage).</P>
<P>
<B>How did we gather evidence for this comparison?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature (January 2017) and identified seven studies that met the inclusion criteria; one study was ongoing and six studies were eligible for inclusion in the updated review.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>The six included studies comprised a total of 435 participants with primary spontaneous pneumothorax; 208 of these underwent simple aspiration and 227 underwent intercostal tube drainage. Study results show that tube drainage produced a better rate of immediate treatment success when compared with simple aspiration for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, simple aspiration was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization and may have led to fewer adverse events. Researchers noted no significant differences between the two treatments with regard to hospitalization rate, early failure rate, one-year success rate, or patient satisfaction. However, the quality of evidence presented in this review ranged between very low and moderate, making it difficult for review authors to come to definitive conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Results of this review indicate that tube drainage has a better immediate success rate than simple aspiration for treating people with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, simple aspiration results in a shorter hospital stay and, although the evidence presented for this outcome is of low quality, may lead to fewer adverse events than are reported with tube drainage. The overall quality of evidence ranges from very low to moderate, and future research is needed to strengthen the evidence presented in this review.</P>

<P>For management of pneumothorax that occurs without underlying lung disease, also referred to as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, simple aspiration is technically easier to perform than intercostal tube drainage.

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017); and Embase (1980 to January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry for ongoing trials (January 2017). We checked the reference lists of included trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-26 01:47:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of 2332 publications obtained through the search strategy, seven studies met the inclusion criteria; one study was ongoing and six studies of 435 participants were eligible for inclusion in the updated review. Data show a significant difference in immediate success rates of procedures favouring tube drainage over simple aspiration for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.89; 435 participants, 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Duration of hospitalization however was significantly less for patients treated by simple aspiration (mean difference (MD) -1.66, 95% CI -2.28 to -1.04; 387 participants, 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence). A narrative synthesis of evidence revealed that simple aspiration led to fewer adverse events (245 participants, 3 studies; low-quality evidence), but data suggest no differences between groups in terms of one-year success rate (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.18; 318 participants, 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence), hospitalization rate (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.47; 245 participants, 3 studies; very low-quality evidence), and patient satisfaction (median between-group difference of 0.5 on a scale from 1 to 10; 48 participants, 1 study; low-quality evidence). No studies provided data on cost-effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-26 01:31:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available trials showed low to moderate-quality evidence that intercostal tube drainage produced higher rates of immediate success, while simple aspiration resulted in a shorter duration of hospitalization. Although adverse events were reported more commonly for patients treated with tube drainage, the low quality of the evidence warrants caution in interpreting these findings. Similarly, although this review observed no differences between groups when early failure rate, one-year success rate, or hospital admission rate was evaluated, this too needs to be put into the perspective of the quality of evidence, specifically, for evidence of very low and low quality for hospitalization rate and patient satisfaction, respectively. Future adequately powered research is needed to strengthen the evidence presented in this review.</P>

<P>Pneumothorax is defined as trapping of air or gas in the space between the lung and the chest wall (the pleural space) (<LINK REF="REF-Light-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noppen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noppen 2010</LINK>). Spontaneous pneumothoraces may have no identifiable cause (e.g. trauma), making this a topic of ongoing debate among healthcare professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Sahn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tschopp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschopp 2015</LINK>). Two main types of spontaneous pneumothoraces may occur: primary and secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a pneumothorax that occurs in a patient with clinically unapparent lung disease. Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces occur in patients with underlying lung disease, most often chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Currie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Light-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1994</LINK>). Although their exact cause remains unknown, PSPs are believed to be associated with diffuse, often bilateral, abnormalities (including but not limited to subpleural blebs or bullae) within the pleura (<LINK REF="REF-Grundy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noppen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noppen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is a significant global problem, with a reported incidence of 18 to 28 per 100,000 men per year and 1.2 to 6 per 100,000 women per year (<LINK REF="REF-Grundy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1979</LINK>). Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is more prevalent among individuals who smoke (<LINK REF="REF-Bense-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bense 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grundy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundy 2012</LINK>). Combined global hospital admission rates for primary and secondary pneumothoraces have been reported at 16.7 per 100,000 men per year and 5.8 per 100,000 women per year (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK>). The United Kingdom (UK) has reported mortality rates of 1.26 per million men per year and 0.62 per million women per year (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK>). Meanwhile, in the USA, PSP affects more than 20,000 individuals per year (<LINK REF="REF-Melton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1979</LINK>) and accounts for nearly USD130,000,000 in annual healthcare expenditures (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-26 01:38:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with small PSPs may require only observation with supplemental oxygen. However, recommendations often call for active intervention for a large pneumothorax, with an apex-to-cupola distance &#8805; 3 cm or measuring &#8805; 15%/20% on the Light Index (<LINK REF="REF-Noppen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noppen 2001</LINK>), or for one that causes substantial dyspnoea, chest pain, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Noppen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noppen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pasquier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasquier 2013</LINK>). Percutaneous needle aspiration, hereafter referred to as simple aspiration, is performed by placing an intravenous catheter into the pleural space at the intersection of the midclavicular line and the second or third intercostal space, then using a large syringe to withdraw air or gas from the pleural space. This procedure can be performed in the emergency department (ED) without the need for hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alternatively, intercostal tube drainage (hereafter referred to as tube drainage) involves insertion of a small-bore catheter that is attached to a one-way flutter valve into the pleural space. Most suction devices employ a water-filled chamber, through which air removed from the pleural space bubbles, allowing easy identification of a persistent air leak (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ 2016</LINK>). After insertion, patients can be discharged from the ED with the catheter in situ, as long as the flutter valve is functioning properly (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ 2016</LINK>). In some instances, patients require negative-pressure suction to resolve the pneumothorax and hospitalization may be necessary.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-26 01:39:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For initial management of PSP requiring medical intervention, an air evacuation technique is required, specifically, simple aspiration (thoracocentesis) or insertion of a chest tube (tube thoracostomy), as described above (<LINK REF="REF-Noppen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noppen 2003</LINK>). Goals of pneumothorax treatment include the following: to eliminate the intrapleural air collection, to facilitate pleural healing, and to attempt to prevent recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grundy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundy 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-26 01:39:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two clinical trials conducted in the 1960s led to opposing recommendations for initial management of PSP (<LINK REF="REF-Ruckley-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruckley 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stradling-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stradling 1966</LINK>); since that time, debate has continued, and current guidelines provide contradictory recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bintcliffe-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bintcliffe 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDuff-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDuff 2010</LINK>). The guideline consensus process of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) revealed that simple aspiration is rarely appropriate in any clinical circumstance (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 2001</LINK>). In contrast, current British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for management of PSP recommend simple aspiration as first-line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention (<LINK REF="REF-MacDuff-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDuff 2010</LINK>). More recently, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force recommended aspiration for the first episode of PSP among symptomatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Tschopp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschopp 2015</LINK>). Despite publication of these specific but contradictory guidelines, management of PSP continues to be characterized by empiricism rather than by evidence-based practices (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selby-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selby 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soulsby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soulsby 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeoh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeoh 2000</LINK>). This variability is due in part to the paucity of high-quality evidence and to variable management recommendations within different sets of guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Bintcliffe-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bintcliffe 2015</LINK>). Thus, compliance with guideline recommendations remains poor (<LINK REF="REF-Grundy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundy 2012</LINK>). This review aims to consolidate available evidence for management of PSP by simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage, and to determine the best treatment approach as suggested by current evidence.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-26 02:00:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we found five new studies, complementing the data obtained from the single study identified in the first review (<LINK REF="REF-Wakai-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakai 2007</LINK>) comparing simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) in adults. We therefore included a total of six studies in this updated review. Furthermore, we identified one ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-Desmettre-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Desmettre 2011</LINK>) that can be taken into account in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>The six included trials demonstrated significant improvement in the immediate success rate for tube drainage compared with simple aspiration. Simple aspiration on the contrary led to fewer adverse events and a shorter duration of hospitalization. Furthermore, results show no differences in early failure rate, one-year success rate, patient satisfaction, or hospitalization between simple aspiration and tube drainage. No studies reported directly on cost-effectiveness, but the shorter duration of hospitalization and the fact that simple aspiration is technically easier to perform might indirectly indicate potential benefit in cost-effectiveness for the use of simple aspiration to treat individuals with PSP. These results must be placed in the context of the quality of evidence provided, which ranged from very low to moderate.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-26 02:00:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review update, we identified five additional studies examining whether simple aspiration or chest tube drainage should be preferred as initial treatment for PSP. This review provides information on several relevant outcomes, specifically, immediate treatment success, long-term treatment success, and hospital utilization, for which simple aspiration was performed in an equal or superior way to tube drainage, with the exception of immediate success rate, which was greater in patients treated by tube drainage. Although review authors identified a total of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adequate quality, the total number of participants involved in the combined studies was low. Furthermore, absence of clear-cut data for some of the secondary outcome measures (cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, dyspnoea, and even adequate description of adverse events in some trials) specified in the protocol limits the robustness of conclusions presented in this review.</P>
<P>Although none of the included studies measured cost-effectiveness directly, the shorter duration of hospitalization associated with simple aspiration compared with tube drainage hints towards favourable cost-effectiveness of simple aspiration resulting from the considerable costs associated with hospitalization. This finding is supported by some early studies on the costs of pneumothorax treatment, which show a large proportion of costs going towards hospitalization when video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was compared with tube drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Schramel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schramel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tschopp-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschopp 2002</LINK>), and when inpatient care was compared with outpatient care (<LINK REF="REF-Bense-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bense 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurley 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK>) reported patient satisfaction, making adequate judgement regarding this outcome difficult. Satisfaction is expected to be higher among patients who do not require hospitalization and is expected to be lower when treatment attempts fail (and therefore have to be repeated). Therefore, it will be useful for researchers to take this assessment into account in future studies. Dyspnoea is not always present and is generally mild in PSP, but it plays a more prominent role in secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Noppen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noppen 2010</LINK>). Therefore, it is not completely surprising that none of the included RCTs reported on dyspnoea as an endpoint.</P>
<P>Although most studies reported on several adverse events, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Parlak-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Parlak 2012</LINK>) did not mention any associated complications. Investigators have reported potentially fatal penetration of major organs or blood vessels with both intercostal tube drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holden-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holden 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iberti-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberti 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Symbas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symbas 1989</LINK>) and simple aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Rawlins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawlins 2003</LINK>). Other reported complications of intercostal tube drainage include pleural cavity infection (empyema, with a reported incidence of 1%) (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1997</LINK>), surgical emphysema (<LINK REF="REF-Maunder-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maunder 1984</LINK>), and problems related to displacement or blockage of the tube (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Camuset-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camuset 2006</LINK> reported a transient vagal reaction due to needle aspiration during treatment of PSP as a complication associated with the procedure.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-26 02:01:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of studies included in this review and their risk of bias are adequate but can be considered an issue, as all studies had at least one source of high risk of bias and (multiple) sources of unclear risk. The biggest problem affecting the quality of the evidence is related to inability to perform blinding during treatment. Furthermore, the final participant number of 435 across six studies is not very high. These results led the review author team to downgrade the quality of evidence provided by these studies by one level for all outcomes.</P>
<P>We deemed that evidence on the two significant outcomes included in the meta-analyses - immediate success rate favouring tube drainage and hospitalization duration favouring simple aspiration - was of moderate quality. Downgrading of this evidence resulted from the overall one-level downgrade required by risk of bias of the included studies.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for the other (non-significant) outcomes, namely, one-year success rate, hospitalization rate, adverse events, and patient satisfaction, ranged from very low to moderate. We deemed evidence on hospitalization rate to be of very low quality as a result of very high heterogeneity (I² = 91%) and imprecision of results due to small numbers of events and large confidence intervals. We regarded the quality of evidence for adverse events and patient satisfaction as low. The quality of evidence on adverse events suffered from inconsistency between reported results and an overall lack of appropriate reporting of adverse events, and only one small study including 48 participants reported on patient satisfaction. We downgraded the quality of evidence on one-year success rate only as a result of the overall downgrade due to risk of bias, as reported above. As no trials reported on cost-effectiveness, we could assign no judgement on the quality of this evidence. </P>

However, our search has been executed by a trial specialist, and we have searched for extra studies by going through the reference lists of included studies and other reviews on the topic.

The authors of <LINK REF="REF-Aguinagalde-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aguinagalde 2010</LINK> reported that including <LINK REF="STD-Andrivet-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Andrivet 1995</LINK> in particular caused the risk ratio for the immediate success rate to favour tube drainage in their meta-analysis, but that this advantage disappeared after a week. The difference between these results and those reported in this review, as we review authors have noted ourselves, might be due to a more strict definition of treatment failure in simple aspiration than in tube drainage. We further noted that allowing multiple simple aspiration attempts (to match the longer 10-day interval of continuous aspiration in the tube drainage group) might lead to a better success rate for simple aspiration, which, for instance, was shown in <LINK REF="STD-Ayed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ayed 2006</LINK> (13 out of 25 second attempt simple aspirations were successful) but not in <LINK REF="STD-Noppen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Noppen 2002</LINK> (0 out of 6 were successful). The second difference noted in <LINK REF="REF-Aguinagalde-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aguinagalde 2010</LINK> lies in the definition of 'treatment success', which specifically affects an outcome that was not specified in the current review: one-week success. Study authors in <LINK REF="STD-Ayed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ayed 2006</LINK> and authors of the current review consider treatment in the simple aspiration group to have occurred even if the participant received tube drainage as a result of failed previous attempts at simple aspiration. <LINK REF="REF-Aguinagalde-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aguinagalde 2010</LINK> did not use this definition and accepted treatment success by simple aspiration only. As our review is based on intention-to-treat, we view success as belonging to the treatment to which participants were initially randomized, which can be considered a limitation owing to the specific protocols chosen by trial authors.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Zehtabchi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zehtabchi 2008</LINK> review included <LINK REF="STD-Ayed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ayed 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1994</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Noppen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Noppen 2002</LINK>, and the <LINK REF="REF-Devanand-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devanand 2004</LINK> review included <LINK REF="STD-Andrivet-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Andrivet 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1994</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Noppen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Noppen 2002</LINK>. Findings from both reviews as well as their evidence ratings are mostly in line with those of the current review. The discussion point of <LINK REF="REF-Zehtabchi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zehtabchi 2008</LINK> on limitations of RCTs versus expertise-based RCTs for non-pharmaceutical trials such as pneumothorax treatment (see <LINK REF="REF-Cook-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2015</LINK> for a review) is interesting and should be considered for investigation in future trials.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the current review found no advantage for hospitalization rate, although all three of the other reviews reported such an advantage. Inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK> led to significant heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis revealed that heterogeneity is likely due to admission of all patients for tube drainage in <LINK REF="STD-Ayed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ayed 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Noppen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Noppen 2002</LINK>, although <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK> did not automatically admit all patients who underwent a tube drainage procedure.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-26 02:03:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) in adults, trials show significant benefit for immediate success rate of the procedure with tube drainage and no differences between groups for early failure rate, one-year success rate, or hospital admission rate. However, researchers found that simple aspiration was associated with reduced duration of hospitalization and fewer adverse events when compared with intercostal tube drainage. The quality of evidence for this review ranged from very low to moderate, with downgrading due to risk of bias, low event numbers, inconsistent reporting, and substantial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Taken together with findings from prospective studies and other excluded trials, and given that simple aspiration is relatively easier to perform, simple aspiration seems to be an attractive first-line treatment option that can reduce the burden on the healthcare system by preventing hospital admissions when they are not needed. The main results of this review validate existing guidelines and consensus statements, which point to simple aspiration as first-line treatment for all individuals with PSP requiring intervention (<LINK REF="REF-MacDuff-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDuff 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tschopp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschopp 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>Well-powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of good methodological design are needed to further validate the primary findings of this review and to address the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Future trials should look into (or account for) the effect of tube drainage after failed simple aspiration attempts on future outcomes (e.g. one-year success rate).</LI>
<LI>Unaddressed topics of this review should be addressed, namely, cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction. A major limitation of currently available RCTs is that they do not consistently report complications associated with simple aspiration and intercostal tube drainage in the management of PSP; future clinical trials should address complications as an important outcome measure. Although the ongoing trial of <LINK REF="STD-Desmettre-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Desmettre 2011</LINK> might bolster participant numbers and thus the power of this review, outcomes specified on clinicaltrials.gov seem to focus only on success rate and size at different intervals, leaving some topics unexamined.</LI>
<LI>Future trials must consider adding a control group that receives only observation as treatment, as observation has been shown to be effective in treating patients with PSP (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Future studies need to look into the role of expertise of the treating clinician (i.e. by deploying an expertise-based design). Especially tube drainage is susceptible to complications due to technical error, and this can further add to morbidity and unnecessary hospital utilization.</LI>

<I>Aspiration description: </I>Simple aspiration was performed whilst participants were lying in a semi-supine position. The catheter was connected to a 1-bottle water seal vacuum system, regulated to generate a negative pressure of 10 to 15 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Aspiration was performed until cessation of air occurred in the water seal bottle or for a maximum of 30 minutes. Thereafter, the catheter was withdrawn and a chest radiograph was performed. If lung expansion was complete, or if only a small rim of apical pneumothorax was present, the participant was discharged. If no lung expansion or only partial expansion was attained, a second aspiration attempt through a newly inserted catheter, at the same skin site, was performed immediately. If a second attempt was successful, the participant was discharged. If a second attempt was unsuccessful, or if a continuous air leak was observed at the 1-bottle water seal vacuum system, a tube thoracostomy was performed. After discharge, participants were seen at 1 week; at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months; or when indicated.</P>
<P>
<I>Chest tube description: </I>A tube thoracostomy was performed with 20F plastic tubes (Argyle; Sherwood Medical, Argyle, New York). The chest tube was inserted under local anaesthesia at the fourth or fifth interspace at the midaxillary line, and was directed towards the apex. The drain was connected to an underwater seal suction with negative pressure of 20 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. When the air had stopped bubbling and a chest radiograph had confirmed lung expansion, the drain was left connected to the water seal for 24 additional hours. After a chest radiograph, the drain was removed and the participant was allowed home. Chest tube drainage was prolonged if the air leak persisted and incomplete lung expansion remained after 7 days. Thereafter, subsequent treatment (VATS) was performed. After discharge, participants were seen at 1 week; at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months; or earlier if indicated. Any recurrence was proved by a chest radiograph during a follow-up visit. Pethidine, an intramuscular analgesic, was administered every 4 to 6 hours, according to the participant's request, and oral analgesia (acetaminophen) was administered as needed.</P>

<I>Aspiration description: </I>Simple aspiration was performed as follows: Participants were seated in semi-supine position. After skin disinfection and field preparation, a small-calibre polyethane intravenous needle catheter (Intracath, ga; Becton Dickinson, Sandy, Utah) was introduced after local anaesthesia with 2% lidocaine in the second or third intercostal space, at the midclavicular line. After the needle had entered the pleural space (which was witnessed by bubbling of air in the lidocaine-filled syringe), the needle was directed apical and the catheter was advanced</P>
<P>into the pleural space 5 to 10 cm. While the catheter was held in place, the needle was withdrawn. The catheter was fixed to the skin with sterile adhesive tape and was connected via a 3-way valve to a 50-mL syringe. Air was manually aspirated until resistance was felt and air was no longer aspirated. Thereafter, a chest x-ray was performed with the catheter in place, or the catheter was immediately withdrawn and a chest x-ray was performed afterwards, depending on local logistical capacity. When lung expansion was complete, or when only a very small rim of apical air was present, the participant was discharged. If no lung expansion was attained, a second aspiration attempt through the original aspiration catheter when left in place or through a newly inserted catheter at the same skin site (in case of removal of the original catheter for participant transportation) was performed, or subsequent treatment was proposed at the discretion of the local pulmonologist. If a second attempt was successful, the participant was discharged. After discharge, a control chest x-ray was ordered within 48 hours and at 1 week. Thereafter, chest x-rays were ordered at 2, 6, and 12 months, or when indicated.</P>
<P>
<I>Chest tube description: </I>Chest tube drainage was performed with 16F or 20F plastic (Argyle; Sherwood Medical, Tullamore, Ireland) tubes. The chest tube was inserted under local anaesthesia, at the anterior midclavicular second interspace or at the fourth or fifth interspace, at the midaxillary line, and directed to the apex. The drain was connected to a 4-chamber system at water seal (0 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O) or slight aspiration (5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O). When air bubbling had stopped and a chest x-ray had confirmed complete lung expansion, the drain was left at water seal for 24 hours. After a control chest x-ray, the drain was removed at expiration, and the participant was allowed to leave the hospital. Chest drainage was prolonged as long as air leakage persisted and/or no complete lung expansion was attained for a maximum of 7 days. Thereafter, subsequent treatment (e.g. thoracoscopy, thoracotomy) was left to the discretion of the attending pulmonologist. After discharge, participants were seen at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months, or earlier when indicated.</P>

<I>Aspiration description: </I>An angio intravenous catheter with a diameter of 1.3 mm was introduced after local anaesthesia (lidocaine 1%). After fixation to the skin, the intravenous catheter was connected with a 3-way valve to a 50-mL syringe and air was manually aspirated until resistance was felt and no air was acquired any longer. In cases of success with an expanded lung at chest x-ray, the drainage system was disconnected and the participant was observed over 24 hours. If simple aspiration had failed, no second attempt was made and drainage was chosen. After the observation period, a new chest x-ray was taken for final evaluation. When the lung was still expanded at the chest x-ray, discharge followed. When no lung expansion was reached, or in cases of absorption of &gt; 2000 mL air (prolonged air leak), tube drainage was performed.</P>
<P>
<I>Chest tube description: </I>Chest tube drainage was initially performed in a manner similar to simple aspiration. The difference consisted of connection of a drain to a drainage system (tube thoracostomy with 2 reservoirs; Abbott Laboratories; Lake Bluff, Illinois) with negative pressure of 10 mmHg H<SUB>2</SUB>O. When airway leakage had ceased, expansion of the lung was radiologically evaluated. The drain was clipped for 4 hours when the lung had expanded. When expansion of the lung continued after 4 hours, the drain was removed and the participant was discharged. After discharge, participants were seen at day 7, and after 1 year at the outpatient clinic, with a chest x-ray performed to evaluate possible recurrence of the pneumothorax. Otherwise, participants with complaints were seen earlier.</P>
