What is the main outcome (that is important to patients and carers) that nurse led care might improve? This should be presented at the primary outcome and appear as the first one on the Metaview graphs. Hospital admissions or exacerbations spring to mind? I have taken out the fact that 2 reviewers selected the papers as this belongs in methods not objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Sharples, Levy, Levy 2000 and Wade are all missing part or all of their citations. BTS 1989 reference is missing, also NHS plan 2000, also Jones 1996.*** (Thanks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine. Which outcome did the authors regard as primary? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Please change group labels to Nurse and Physician and also graph labels for the last 3 outcomes. Please specify the units for exacerbations in the outcome title (is it per patient per year for example?). ****(Thanks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: &amp;quot;On the basis of limited trial data this review suggests that nurse specialist care for bronchiectatic patients is safe but may use more resources.&amp;quot; You have only one trial with wide confidence intervals so I do not think you can conclude that the treatment is 'safe'. Could you reword this as there is not enough data to make such a strong conclusion? ***(Reads better but you have not shown nurses are as effective as doctors so I have removed this)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Fine, but I am interested that you report first arm costs. See below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Changed to past tense throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;quot;Due to the methodological difficulties of analysing crossover data in a meta-analysis, which assumes that the two sample sizes are separate populations, data have been sought and entered in MetaView from the first arm of the trial. Narrative data are presented from the published paper.&amp;quot; I have changed this because to my mind the crossover design of this study is not suitable, and first arm data is free from carry over so it makes good sense just to use first arm results!&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Due to concerns about carry over in the second arm of this cross over trial, data have been sought and entered in MetaView from the first arm of the trial. Narrative data are presented from the published paper.&amp;quot; is now how this part reads!&lt;br&gt;Please make clear in the narrative results whether you are reporting first arm data or both arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The outcome measures relating to lung function, exercise testing, quality of life and infective exacerbation rate showed no difference between specialist nurse and doctor-led care. The only statistical difference related to increase in hospital admissions in nurse-led care. &amp;quot; I have made clear this is from the paired data.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Long term studies are required to establish whether the changes within the cost effectiveness analysis reflect a learning effect relating to the nurse, an alteration in the physicians' behaviour in the context of a clinical trial, or whether the absence of a wash out time after the first treatment had an effect on outcomes in the second year of treatment. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;The problem of carry-over would persist even with wash-out so I have amended this.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Long term studies are required to establish whether the changes within the cost effectiveness analysis reflect a learning effect relating to the nurse, an alteration in the physicians' behaviour in the context of a clinical trial, or whether carry over had an effect on outcomes in the second year of treatment. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues - In my view parallel design would be safer for future studies. Carry over worries me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked - to be done later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - back to Toby for authors comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21/3/3 (CJC)&lt;br&gt;Many thanks for sorting out most of the above issues. Ready for copy editing so sent back to Toby today. Consumer acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2_5_3&lt;br&gt;Feedback from Peer review has led to the following amendments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract : infective exacerbations added to outcomes.&lt;br&gt;Reviewers' conclusions (amended).&lt;br&gt;This review has found one trial that does not demonstrate significant differences in clinical outcomes between nurse led care and doctor led care within the setting of a specialist clinic is, but there may be increased cost implications. Further research is required to review whether nurse led care provides the same outcomes in the community or secondary care setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Results&lt;br&gt;The search yielded 4 references after duplicates were excluded and searches were current as of 12/06/02. Only one study met the inclusion criteria (Sharples 2002). Please see Characteristics of excluded studies for details of the remaining three studies. No meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis was possible as only a single study was identified.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &lt;br&gt;'Current evidence has not demonstrated a difference between nurse-led care and doctor-led care in the treatment of bronchiectasis, but more research is required as only a single RCT was identified in the search(Sharples 2002), and this was conducted by the authors of the review (JF and DB).' Initial sentence amended to reflect the review not just the RCT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for practice:&lt;br&gt;'Training and education of the nurse to an advanced practice level along with additional training in the specialist area of bronchiectasis was crucial to the success of this role. With appropriate support and expertise the nurse is able to practice autonomously to fulfill the needs of the patients within an outpatient clinic. The only included trial has demonstrated that, in the medium term, a trained nurse can be as effective as medical staff in managing mild and moderately severe bronchiectatics within a specialist clinic, but implications for practice for primary care settings are unknown.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: +Nurse specialist care for bronchiectasis&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-03 09:04:42 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="NUR-BRO" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.14" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease characterised by productive cough and recurrent chest infections. Untreated patients have a poor quality of life and may eventually develop respiratory failure. This review evaluates the process of care in this group of patients and compares nurse led care with the traditional model of physician directed treatment. Only one trial was found to be suitable for evaluation and this showed no significant difference between nurse and doctor led care in terms of lung function, infective flare ups, or quality of life but significantly increased costs in nurse led care due to hospital admissions and use of intravenous antibiotics. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-03 09:04:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition characterised by irreversible dilatation of the bronchi and frequently results in a continuous productive cough or recurrent respiratory infections. Bronchiectasis is not invariably a primary disease but can develop during the evolution of various disease processes (<LINK REF="REF-Katzenstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzenstein 1982</LINK>). Like all chronic respiratory illnesses the aims of care are symptom control , prevention of acute exacerbations and limitation of disease progression .By developing specialist skills nurses' roles have recently evolved to encompass areas previously in the domain of the physician and resulting in a blurring of professional boundaries. These initiatives have been welcomed not only by nurses but also by their medical colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>Within respiratory medicine the respiratory nurse specialist roles has evolved since the early 1980's with the support of the Royal College of Physicians (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 1981</LINK>). The role was initially developed to meet the needs of patients in terms of rehabilitation; ·supervising nebuliser therapy; and working in disease specific areas such as lung cancer patients, Cystic fibrosis, asthma, AIDS with respiratory opportunistic infection and occupational lung disease. The nurse specialists flexible approach to patients needs involved developing the patients and their carers understanding of the respiratory disorder. The role has developed further with nurses providing nurse led clinics in COPD and asthma along with nurses providing early supportive discharge and 'hospital at home' for patients with COPD. In the United Kingdom, government health policy is actively supporting the extension of nurses' skills into areas such as nurse prescribing and the development of nurse practitioner posts (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Plan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Plan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health</LINK>). Does care led and / or delivered by nurse specialists result in better outcomes for patients and is this change in health care delivery a cost effective one? This systematic review seeks to assess the available evidence from randomised controlled trials within the context of managing bronchiectasis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to ascertain effectiveness in terms of clinical outcomes such as lung function and number of exacerbations, patient satisfaction and cost , of nurse specialists managing and/or delivering care to patients suffering with bronchiectasis. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sharples-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sharples 2002</LINK> was a randomised crossover study conducted after initial education of a nurse practitioner in the theoretical and practical aspects of bronchiectasis management . Patients with severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted ) or with coexisting complex medical conditions were excluded .Eighty participants were randomised to receive doctor or nurse led care. Thirty-nine participants were allocated to nurse-led care in the first arm and 41 participants were allocated doctor-led care during the same treatment period. Following one year of doctor or nurse care the participants crossed over with no wash-out period. The second treatment arm was also of one year's duration . Data were obtained for 77 participants following two deaths and one participant unable to complete tests.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sharples-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sharples 2002</LINK> scored 3 on the Jadad scale and was rated A on the Cochrane Collaboration concealment score. The absence of blinding in the trial and the impossibility of blinding participants in this form of intervention renders the Jadad score unreliable in this instance. The sample size was calculated on the basis of establishing equivalence of nurse specialist / practitioner led care and doctor led care. The aim was to exclude differences in FEV1 of &gt; 5% predicted between the two methods of care delivery. The study assumed the standard deviation of 12.5%, at least 80% power, two tailed alpha of 5%, and 10-15% of patients dropping out of the study. Using standard methods (Jones 1996) the required sample size was 80 patients. </P>
<P>Extensive efforts were made to blind observers to allocation of care. Due to the cross over design with no wash out period, the presence of a carry over effect cannot be excluded. This may have an impact on the data pertaining to exacerbations in particular. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-03 06:39:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>No meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis was possible as only a single study was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Sharples-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sharples 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to concerns about carry over in the second arm of this cross over trial, data have been sought and entered in MetaView from the first arm of the trial. Narrative data are presented from the published paper.<BR/>
<BR/>i) Lung function and exercise capacity</P>
<P>There was no statistical difference in FEV1/FVC percent predicted or distance walked between nurse led and doctor led care in the two treatment periods (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). </P>
<P>ii) Infective exacerbations</P>
<P>The study reported on the number of infective exacerbations in each treatment period, reported by the patient, not verified by the physician or nurse. The number of infective exacerbations experienced by patients during nurse practitioner-led care was 262 in 79.4 patient-years of follow up, compared with 238 in 77.8 years during doctor led care. Thus, nurse practitioner-led care resulted in a relative rate of exacerbations of 1.09 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.30), p=0.34; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>iii) Hospital admissions</P>
<P>The study reported a statistically higher proportion of hospital admissions in nurse led care over the trial period. During doctor-led care there were 42 admissions to hospital compared with 66 during nurse-led care, a relative rate of 1.52 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.23), p=0.03. Of these, there were 23 and 43 readmissions respectively attributable to their bronchiectasis, a relative rate of 1.59 (95% CI 0.75 to 3.39), p=0.22; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>.</P>
<P>iv) Health related Quality of life</P>
<P>The study administered the St Georges Respiratory Disease questionnaire which showed no statistical differences in each of the scores for Symptoms, Control, Impact or total score.</P>
<P>v) Cost effectiveness</P>
<P>The study showed that nurse led care resulted in significantly higher costs per patient compared with doctor-led care, and this was largely due to the difference in the number of hospital admissions and intravenous and nebulised antibiotic costs. Three drugs accounted for over 80% of the difference in antibiotic utilisation, namely intravenous meropenem and ceftazidime and nebulised colistin. These were not prescribed frequently but the high unit cost of these drugs ensured that the slight increased use in patients being cared for by the nurse was economically important. Most of the intravenous antibiotics were prescribed for treatment of pseudomonas infection as per a well defined protocol. All hospital admissions were pre-authorised by medical staff and the length of stay of these patients were determined by the medical staff.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Current evidence has not demonstrated a difference between nurse-led care and doctor-led care in the treatment of bronchiectasis, but more research is required as only a single RCT was identified in the search (<LINK REF="STD-Sharples-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sharples 2002</LINK>), and this was conducted by the authors of the review (JF and DB). In this RCT the role of the nurse specialist/practitioner demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of this role compared to doctor led care. Eighty patients with stable bronchiectasis were randomised to receive one year periods of care from the nurse practitioner or a physician. The nurse specialist/practitioner had been trained to practice at an advanced level but required additional training in the specialist aspect of this disease prior to the study.</P>
<P>A crossover design had the advantage that each patient acted as their own control, fewer patients were required to assess outcome (because within-patient variability is less than between-patient variability), and it partially controlled for observer variation. The crossover design is particularly suitable for patients with a stable condition but it is recognised that there is the possibility of a carry-over effect (unless a " wash-out " period between treatments is incorporated into the trial design) with the danger that the effects of the earlier treatment is falsely attributed to the final experimental treatment. This order and time effect needs to be checked for within the analyses but it can rarely be excluded as potential biasing factors (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcome measures relating to lung function, exercise testing, quality of life and infective exacerbation rate showed no difference between specialist nurse and doctor-led care. The only statistical difference related to increase in hospital admissions in nurse-led care, when the paired data from both arms of the trial are considered. Cost-effectiveness was reported in the study which showed that there was a significant additional resource use in nurse led-care related to the hospital admissions, in the first year of the trial. However, the difference between nurse and doctor led care was substantially less in the second year. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Training and education of the nurse to an advanced practice level along with additional training in the specialist area of bronchiectasis was crucial to the success of this role. With appropriate support and expertise the nurse is able to practice autonomously to fulfill the needs of the patients within an outpatient clinic. The only included trial has demonstrated that, in the medium term, a trained nurse can be as effective as medical staff in managing mild and moderately severe bronchiectatics within a specialist clinic, but implications for practice for primary care settings are unknown.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Long term studies are required to establish whether the changes within the cost effectiveness analysis reflect a learning effect relating to the nurse, an alteration in the physicians' behaviour in the context of a clinical trial, or whether carry over had an effect on outcomes in the second year of treatment. Studies also need to be carried out in other settings.</P>
