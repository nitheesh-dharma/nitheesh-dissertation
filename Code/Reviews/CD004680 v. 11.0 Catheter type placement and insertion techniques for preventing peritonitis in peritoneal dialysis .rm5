<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No reduction in the incidence of peritonitis could be shown from catheter-related interventions for peritoneal dialysis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People with advanced kidney disease may be treated with peritoneal dialysis where a catheter is permanently inserted into the peritoneum (lining around abdominal contents) through the abdominal wall and sterile fluid is drained in and out a few times each day. The most common serious complication is infection of the peritoneum - peritonitis. This may be caused by bacteria accidentally being transferred from the catheter. This review of different catheter types, insertion or immobilisation techniques showed that they do not reduce the incidence of peritonitis.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-09-22 22:08:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>As many as 15-50% of end-stage kidney disease patients are on peritoneal dialysis (PD), but peritonitis limits its more widespread use. Several PD catheter-related interventions have been purported to reduce the risk of peritonitis in PD. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the use of catheter-related interventions for the prevention of peritonitis in PD. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (June 2004), The Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2 2004), MEDLINE (1966-April 2004), EMBASE (1988-April 2004) and reference lists were searched without language restriction</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials comparing different catheter insertion techniques, catheter types, use of immobilisation techniques or different break in periods were included. Trials of different PD sets were excluded.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 22:08:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen eligible trials (1089 patients) were identified, eight of surgical strategies of catheter insertion, eight of straight versus coiled catheters, one of single cuff versus double cuff catheters and one of an immobiliser device. The methodological quality was suboptimal. There were no significant differences with laparoscopy compared with laparotomy for peritonitis, the peritonitis rate, exit-site/tunnel infection or catheter removal/replacement. Standard insertion with resting but no subcutaneous burying of the catheter versus implantation and subcutaneous burying was not associated with a significant reduction in peritonitis rate, exit-site/tunnel infection rate or all-cause mortality. Midline compared to lateral insertion showed no significant difference in the risk of peritonitis or exit-site/tunnel infection. There was no significant difference in the risk of peritonitis, peritonitis rate, exit-site/tunnel infection, exit-site/tunnel infection rate or catheter removal/replacement between straight versus coiled intraperitoneal portion catheters. One trial compared single versus double cuffed catheters and showed no significant difference in the risk of peritonitis, exit-site/tunnel infection or catheter removal/replacement. One trial compared immobilisation versus no immobilisation of the PD catheter and showed no significant difference in the risk of peritonitis and exit-site/tunnel infection. No trials of different break-in periods were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No major advantages from any of the catheter-related interventions which have been purported to reduce the risk of PD peritonitis could be demonstrated in this review. The frequency and quality of available trials are suboptimal. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-22 22:08:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), a major cause of hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-CANUSA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CANUSA 1996</LINK>) and is associated with increased morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Luzar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzar 1990</LINK>) and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Digenis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Digenis 1990</LINK>). There is variability in the use of PD across countries. Fifteen percent of the United States end stage kidney disease (ESRD) population is on PD. In other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom (35%), New Zealand (55%) and Mexico (90%), the rates are higher but the major limitation to the broader uptake of PD is still an unacceptably high rate of peritonitis. The incidence of peritonitis depends on age, coexisting diseases (e.g. diabetes), PD modality and interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Yishak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yishak 2001</LINK>), catheter design and implantation technique, connection methodology and the presence of nasal reservoirs of <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Schaefer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaefer 2003</LINK>). Although there has been a dramatic decrease in the rates of peritonitis from the inception of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), rates above 0.5 episodes/patient/year are still common (<LINK REF="REF-Piraino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piraino 2002</LINK>). These values are even higher in the paediatric population (<LINK REF="REF-Oxton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salusky-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salusky 1997</LINK>). In addition, the rate of peritonitis relapse is approximately 0.5 episodes/patient/year (<LINK REF="REF-Vas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vas 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Risk factors identified for peritonitis in the absence of prophylactic antibiotic treatment at the time of catheter placement are <I>S. aureus</I> nasal carriage, the use of single cuffed (versus double-cuffed) catheters and the upward (versus downward) pointing of the tunnel (<LINK REF="REF-Piraino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piraino 2002</LINK>). Particular populations including the immunosuppressed patients, African-American and native American patients are also at increased risk (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piraino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piraino 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevention of PD peritonitis has primarily focused on anti-microbial prophylaxis. The evaluation of evidence which underlies the use of different anti-microbial strategies to prevent PD has been the subject of an another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK>). There has also been a systematic review on the use of Y-set compared to double bag systems (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 2001</LINK>) however the impact of catheter types (straight versus coiled, single versus double-cuffed), types of surgical insertion techniques (laparoscopy versus laparotomy, midline versus lateral insertion, subcutaneous buried versus standard insertion with resting but no subcutaneous burying of the catheter), different break-in periods and catheter immobilisation devices on preventing PD peritonitis have not been systematically assessed. </P>
<P>Many of these interventions are routinely used but guidelines on the topic are rare and indications relating to catheter types and insertion techniques are few. In general guidelines have focused on aspects of connection methodology rather than catheter type and insertion technique (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Published guidelines on catheter related interventions in peritoneal dialysis</I>).</P>
<P>In this review we focused on the effectiveness of different catheter types, placement and insertion techniques, break-in period and use of immobilisation devices for the prevention of infection in PD patients. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the evidence that supports the use of different catheter types and placement and insertion techniques, break in periods and immobilisation devices for the prevention of peritonitis in PD patients. </P>

<P>The review was undertaken by five reviewers (GFMS, AT, DJ, FPS, JC). The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that might be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by GFMS and AT, who discarded studies that were not applicable based on the inclusion criteria for this review; however studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on trials were retained initially and their full-text version was analysed. Reviewers GFMS and AT independently assessed retrieved abstracts and, if necessary, the full text of these studies to determine study eligibility. Data extraction was carried out independently by the same reviewers using standard data extraction forms. It was planned that studies reported in non-English language journals would be translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one trial existed, only the publication with the most complete data was included. Any further information or clarification required from the authors was requested by written or electronic correspondence and relevant information obtained in this manner was included in the review. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with DJ and JC.</P>

<P>Data from individual trials were analysed using the risk ratio (RR) measure and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis was planned to explore potential sources of variability in observed treatment effect where possible (paediatric versus adult population, diabetic versus non-diabetic, trial quality, timing of peritonitis or other outcome). Heterogeneity of treatment effects between studies was formally tested using the Q (heterogeneity &#967;²) and the I² statistics. When appropriate, summary estimators of treatment effects were calculated using a random effects model with RR and its 95% CI. Where data on the number of subjects with events (e.g. number of subjects with one or more episodes of peritonitis) were available, the RR was calculated as the ratio of the incidence of the event (one or more episodes) in the experimental treatment group over the incidence in the control group. Where data on the number of episodes were available, then the RR was calculated as the ratio of the rate of the outcome (e.g. the peritonitis rate) in the experimental treatment group (given by number of episodes of the outcome over total patient months on PD) over the rate in the control group. It was also planned that if sufficient RCTs were identified, an attempt would be made to assess for publication bias using a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Our systematic review of PD catheter-related interventions has found that no catheter-related interventions (including surgical catheter insertion technique, straight versus coiled catheters, single cuff versus double cuff, immobiliser devices) have any impact on the risk of peritonitis, exit-site and tunnel infection in PD. The use of straight catheters was found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to coiled catheters (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.99), although rates of peritonitis, exit site/tunnel infections and catheter removal/replacement were comparable between the two catheter types which makes the finding very likely to be spurious. </P>
<P>To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first of its kind in that it represents a comprehensive systematic review of the relative benefits and harms of different catheter-related interventions in PD patients. A previous systematic review of 12 RCTs (991 patients) only focused on the use of disconnect systems in PD (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 2001</LINK>). The analysis demonstrated that conventional spike systems were associated with significantly increased peritonitis rates compared with the disconnect systems. The most likely reason for this observation is a reduction of inadvertent peritoneal microbial contamination during connections with Y-set and twin bag systems as a result of the "flush before fill" manoeuvre (<LINK REF="REF-Bazzato-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bazzato 1993</LINK>). Our review demonstrates that no other catheter-related interventions have been proven to significantly impact on patient outcomes. The one exception was the analysis of straight versus coiled catheters (comparison 04.01 ) which demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality associated with straight catheters. This result was unexpected and largely unexplained, particularly in view of the similar rates of peritonitis, exit site/tunnel infections and catheter removal/replacement observed with the two catheter types. Causes of death were not reported to clarify further on this finding. Only one trial reported that three deaths were associated with complications of diabetes and one with amyloidosis (<LINK REF="STD-Eklund-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eklund 1995</LINK>). Potential alternate explanations include 1) a type 1 statistical error (most likely), or 2) inadequate randomizations, possibly due to sub-optimal allocation concealment. In any case, this result should be interpreted with caution. </P>
<P>An appreciable number of PD catheter implantation techniques have been proposed to reduce the risk of catheter-associated infections. These methods have been described in detail in the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis guidelines for peritoneal catheter management (<LINK REF="REF-Gokal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gokal 1998</LINK>). Our review identified eight RCTs of PD catheter insertion techniques (laparoscopy versus laparotomy or subcutaneous buried versus standard insertion or midline versus lateral placement), but found no evidence that any particular technique resulted in enhanced clinical outcomes. These findings support the recommendations of the CARI Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Bannister-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bannister 2003</LINK>), which state that no implantation technique has been definitively shown to be superior. On the contrary, no trials of break-in period were identified.</P>
<P>The strength of this investigation is that it represents a comprehensive systematic review based on a previous publication of a detailed protocol, rigid inclusion criteria for RCTs only and a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data extraction, data analysis and method quality assessment were performed by two independent investigators, and consistency was checked with an additional two reviewers. Furthermore, infectious outcomes were separately examined in terms of rates/patient-months and the number of patients affected in order to maximise statistical power and to verify the robustness of statistical analyses.</P>
<P>The main weakness of this study was the relative paucity of quality RCTs. The vast majority of studies evaluated failed to specify whether randomisation and allocation was concealed, outcome assessors were blinded or data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Many studies were small and often short in duration, so that the possibility of a type 2 statistical error for some of the less frequently observed outcome measures (e.g. catheter loss) could not be excluded. Moreover, evidence of trial heterogeneity was found in some analyses of peritonitis rates (such as for laparoscopy versus laparotomy), which most likely reflected significant inter-trial variation (e.g. durations of follow-up, type of catheter). These issues reduce the strength of the conclusions that have been drawn in this review. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review demonstrates that no clear benefit is observed for different catheter designs and implantation techniques for preventing PD peritonitis. Additionally, judging by the point estimates in our analyses, none of the interventions looked promising. A survival advantage was identified for straight catheters compared with coiled catheters, but these results should be interpreted with caution, since no clear differences were observed with respect to peritonitis, exit site/tunnel infections, catheter removal/replacement or technique survival, i.e. the inability to shown an intervention-related mechanism for reduction in mortality suggests this is a spurious finding. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In terms of clinical research, this review demonstrates that PD catheter-related interventions have been very poorly studied to date. There is an obvious need in this area for well-designed, RCTs, with clear descriptions of trial methodologies.</P>
