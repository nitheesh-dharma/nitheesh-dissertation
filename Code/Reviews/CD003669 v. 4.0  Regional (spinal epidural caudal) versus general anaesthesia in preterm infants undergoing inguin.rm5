<P>Lay title: Regional versus general anaesthesia in preterm infants undergoing inguinal hernia repair in early infancy</P>
<P>Review question: In preterm infants undergoing inguinal hernia repair, does the use of regional anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia reduce postoperative complications including apnoea, bradycardia and the use of assisted ventilation?</P>
<P>Background: babies born preterm (before 37 weeks) often have serious health problems and sometimes need surgery. Inguinal hernia (IH) (where the intestine protrudes through the abdominal wall) is the commonest condition where surgery is needed. General anaesthetics for surgery can disrupt breathing and cause other complications in preterm babies. Regional anaesthetics including spinal block (injection) might avoid complications such as pauses in breathing in the first 24 hours after surgery. Whether this improves outcomes for preterm babies having surgery is unclear because no trials have looked at the effects of anaesthetics on brain function in older children.</P>
<P>Study characteristics: seven small trials comparing spinal with general anaesthesia in the repair of IH were identified.</P>
<P>Results: there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of postoperative apnoea/bradycardia, postoperative oxygen desaturations, the use of postoperative analgesics, or postoperative respiratory support between infants receiving spinal or general anaesthesia. When infants who had received preoperative sedatives were excluded, the meta-analysis supported a reduction in the risk of postoperative apnoea in the spinal anaesthesia group. Infants with no history of apnoea in the preoperative period and receiving spinal anaesthesia (including a subset of infants who received sedatives) had a reduced risk of postoperative apnoea. Infants receiving spinal rather than general anaesthesia had a statistically significant increased risk of anaesthetic agent failure. Infants randomised to receive spinal anaesthesia had an increased risk of anaesthetic placement failure of borderline statistical significance.</P>
<P>Conclusions: there is some evidence to suggest that spinal anaesthesia without the addition of sedative drugs to assist in keeping the baby still and provide additional pain relief during the procedure may be safer than general anaesthesia for a former preterm baby having surgery for inguinal hernia. A recently completed but as yet unpublished large multicentre trial comparing general anaesthesia or awake spinal anaesthesia may help give more precise answers to this question.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-13 10:38:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With improvements in neonatal intensive care, more preterm infants are surviving the neonatal period and presenting for surgery in early infancy. Inguinal hernia is the most common condition requiring early surgery, appearing in 38% of infants whose birth weight is between 751 grams and 1000 grams. Approximately 20% to 30% of otherwise healthy preterm infants having general anaesthesia for inguinal hernia surgery at a postmature age have at least one apnoeic episode within the postoperative period. Research studies have failed to adequately distinguish the effects of apnoeic episodes from other complications of extreme preterm gestation on the risk of brain injury, or to investigate the potential impact of postoperative apnoea upon longer term neurodevelopment. In addition to episodes of apnoea, there are concerns that anaesthetic and sedative agents may have a direct toxic effect on the developing brain of preterm infants even after reaching postmature age. It is proposed that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of postoperative apnoea, avoid the risk of anaesthetic-related neurotoxicity and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants requiring surgery for inguinal hernia at a postmature age.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-22 09:42:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven small trials comparing spinal with general anaesthesia in the repair of inguinal hernia were identified. Two trial reports are listed as 'Studies awaiting classification' due to insufficient information on which to base an eligibility assessment. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of postoperative apnoea/bradycardia (typical RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.06; 4 studies, 138 infants), postoperative oxygen desaturation (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 2 studies, 48 infants), the use of postoperative analgesics (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.18; 1 study, 44 infants), or postoperative respiratory support (typical RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to1.64; 3 studies, 98 infants) between infants receiving spinal or general anaesthesia. When infants who had received preoperative sedatives were excluded, the meta-analysis supported a reduction in the risk of postoperative apnoea in the spinal anaesthesia group (typical RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.82; 4 studies, 129 infants). Infants with no history of apnoea in the preoperative period and receiving spinal anaesthesia (including a subset of infants who had received sedatives) had a reduced risk of postoperative apnoea and this reached statistical significance (typical RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.81; 4 studies, 134 infants). Infants receiving spinal rather than general anaesthesia had a statistically significant increased risk of anaesthetic agent failure (typical RR 7.83, 95% CI 1.51 to 40.58; 3 studies, 92 infants). Infants randomised to receive spinal anaesthesia had an increased risk of anaesthetic placement failure of borderline statistical significance (typical RR 7.38, 95% CI 0.98 to 55.52; typical RD 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.27; 3 studies, 90 infants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-13 10:38:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence to suggest that the administration of spinal in preference to general anaesthesia without pre- or intraoperative sedative administration may reduce the risk of postoperative apnoea by up to 47% in preterm infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy at a postmature age. For every four infants treated with spinal anaesthesia, one infant may be prevented from having an episode of postoperative apnoea (NNTB=4). In those infants without preoperative apnoea, there is low-quality evidence that spinal rather than general anaesthesia may reduce the risk of preoperative apnoea by up to 66%. There was no difference in the effect of spinal compared with general anaesthesia on the overall incidence of postoperative apnoea, bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, need for postoperative analgesics or respiratory support. Limitations on these results included varying use of sedative agents, or different anaesthetic agents, or combinations of these factors, in addition to trial quality aspects such as allocation concealment and inadequate blinding of intervention and outcome assessment. The meta-analyses may have inadequate power to detect a difference between groups for some outcomes, with estimates of effect based on a total population of fewer than 140 infants.</P>
<P>The effect of newer, rapidly acting, quickly metabolised general anaesthetic agents on safety with regard to the risk of postoperative apnoea and neurotoxic exposure has not so far been established in randomised trials. There is potential for harm from postoperative apnoea and direct brain toxicity from general anaesthetic agents superimposed upon pre-existing altered brain development in infants born at very to extreme preterm gestation. This highlights the clear need for the examination of neurodevelopmental outcomes in the context of large randomised controlled trials of general, compared with spinal, anaesthesia, in former preterm infants undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia.There is a particular need to examine the impact of the choice of spinal over general anaesthesia on respiratory and neurological outcomes in high-risk infant subgroups with severe respiratory disease and previous brain injury.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inguinal hernia in preterm infants</HEADING>
<P>With improved neonatal intensive care management protocols, more preterm infants are surviving the neonatal period. With this increase, more infants are presenting for surgery in early infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Welborn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welborn 1997</LINK>). Inguinal hernia (IH) is a common developmental problem in infants and children (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>). Patency of the processus vaginalis is the major factor in the development of IH in female infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>). By 32 weeks' gestation, the testes in males have normally entered the scrotum and contraction of the inguinal canal has begun. Contraction of the female inguinal canal normally occurs at a similar gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preterm gestation is the single most important predisposing factor for the development of IH (<LINK REF="REF-Grosfeld-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosfeld 1989</LINK>). The incidence increases with decreasing birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>); and appears in 38% of infants whose birth weight is between 751g and 1000g (<LINK REF="REF-Peevy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peevy 1986</LINK>); and in 16% of those whose birth weight is between 1001g and 1250g (<LINK REF="REF-Peevy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peevy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajput-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajput 1992</LINK>). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia has also been associated with an increased incidence of IH (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>). It has been proposed that increased intra-abdominal pressure resulting from chronic lung disease or gastrointestinal dysfunction could be a predisposing factor to the development of IH (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1986</LINK>). In addition, inadequate calorie or protein intake can lead to poor muscle and tissue growth (<LINK REF="REF-Georgieff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgieff 1986</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-13 10:38:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IH requires early surgical repair because of the risk of bowel incarceration and vascular compromise of bowel and gonadal tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Rescorla-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rescorla 1984</LINK>). The interventions to be evaluated in this review include the effect of different anaesthetic approaches (general versus spinal) on postoperative respiratory dysfunction and analgesic requirements.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Postoperative respiratory dysfunction</HEADING>
<P>A major concern in the management of the preterm infant undergoing surgery is the incidence of postoperative apnoea, with or without bradycardia, associated with general anaesthesia. Apnoea in preterm infants has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds; or one less than 20 seconds and associated with cyanosis, marked pallor, hypotonia or bradycardia (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1987</LINK>). It appears to be related to an immature respiratory central control mechanism and musculature, and is characterised by an unstable elastic rib cage, an upper airway that is prone to obstruction, a lower airway prone to collapse, plus a predisposition to hypothermia and anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1995</LINK>). Apnoea and bradycardia reduce cerebral blood flow in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cot_x00e9_-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coté 1995</LINK>); and have been associated with significant oxygen desaturations in former preterm infants recovering from anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Kurth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cot_x00e9_-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coté 1995</LINK>). Alterations in cerebral blood flow and tissue oxygenation increase the risk of brain ischaemia and intracranial bleeding and have the capacity to affect long-term brain development (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Earlier postoperative studies have demonstrated that approximately 10% to 30% of otherwise healthy preterm infants undergong inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anaesthesia at greater than term corrected (postmature) age will have one or more episodes of apnoea in the postoperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Gollin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gollin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sims-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>), a risk which is inversely proportional to postmenstrual age (PMA: gestational age plus postnatal age) (<LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gollin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gollin 1993</LINK>). More recent observational studies suggest that the risk of postoperative apnoea is much lower when newer anaesthetic agents (for example sevoflurane and desflurane) are used, occurring in fewer than 5% of infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2011</LINK>). Other specific risk factors for apnoea include anaemia (hematocrit less than 30%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia and ongoing apnoea at home (<LINK REF="REF-Cot_x00e9_-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coté 1995</LINK>).The risk period for apnoea, bradycardia or periodic breathing extends from the intraoperative period until many hours later. The peak period for onset of apnoea is within the first 12 hours after surgery, continuing until 48 hours, and up to 72 hours postsurgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sims-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anaesthetics produce dose-dependent and drug-specific changes in the mechanics and central control of the respiratory centre. Inhaled anaesthetics decrease muscle tone within the airways, chest wall and diaphragm, in addition to inhibiting central respiratory drive and responsiveness to ventilatory stimulants such as carbon dioxide. Intravenous anaesthetics may also alter respiratory function whilst opioids produce a dose-dependent depression of medullary respiratory centres, also resulting in decreased responsiveness to partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO&#8322;) (<LINK REF="REF-Welborn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welborn 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the high incidence of postoperative apnoea in former preterm infants undergoing anaesthesia, a number of investigators have postulated that a safe operating period does not commence until a postmenstrual age of greater than 44 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malviya-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malviya 1993</LINK>); or even greater than 60 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Kurth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurth 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Neurological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Experimental studies have indicated a link between the use of anaesthetic agents and brain cell destruction. Infants having undergone surgery demonstrated smaller brain grey matter volumes which may arise from thalamic susceptibility to brain cell apoptosis from exposure to sedative and anaesthetic agent combinations (<LINK REF="REF-Filan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filan 2012</LINK>). Infants undergoing IH surgery and receiving general anaesthetic agents performed worse on academic testing at 15 to 16 years of age compared to non-surgical infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2011</LINK>). However, the differences in mental development indices and test scores were no longer statistically significant between exposed and unexposed groups after adjusting for confounders commonly associated with mortality and poor neurosensory outcomes: gestational age, gender, birthweight, and severity of lung disease. It is possible that the lower scores reflected the greater overall risk of morbidity in the population of infants (greater proportion of low birth weight and chronic lung disease) requiring IH surgery. Another explanation is that the lack of difference in cognitive ability in later life between former preterm infants receiving regional, compared with general, anaesthesia for IH surgery in these studies may be related to the theoretical effect of neuroplasticity on the recovery of synaptic function (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2011</LINK>). In contrast, children undergoing IH surgery at less than three years of age and exposed to anaesthetic agents including ketamine were twice as likely to be diagnosed with a developmental disorder or behavioural disorder or both at follow-up (mean age of 30 months, range 12 to 48 months) compared with those unexposed to IH surgery (<LINK REF="REF-DiMaggio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiMaggio 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is an attendant 'small but potentially catastrophic risk' of spinal cord injury, the exact frequency of which is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Berde-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berde 2005</LINK>). However, existing studies imply low incidence for this complication (<LINK REF="REF-Giaufr_x00e9_-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giaufré 1996</LINK>). The benefit of regional anaesthesia may also be limited if placement or anaesthetic failure rates (or both) result in repeated attempts, increased operative time and the addition of a general anaesthetic. The ease of placement and effectiveness of caudal compared to spinal anaesthesia has been evaluated in case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Tobias-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobias 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geze-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geze 2011</LINK>); and small observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Geze-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geze 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>A large proportion of extremely low and very low birth weight infants develop inguinal hernias and these infants are at highest risk of postoperative apnoea and altered brain development. Anaesthetic and sedative agents are postulated to cause neurotoxic changes within the infant brain, and animal studies indicate increased vulnerability during periods of rapid brain growth and synaptogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Jevtovic_x002d_Todorovic-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jevtovic-Todorovic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fredriksson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredriksson 2007</LINK>).The developing brain of the preterm infant is at particular risk of neurotoxicity. Therefore it is important to determine whether avoiding a brief exposure to anaesthetic agents during surgery with the use of regional, in preference to general, anaesthesia improves long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in former preterm infants requiring inguinal herniorrhaphy. The potential benefit of this on longer term neurological outcomes needs to be balanced against the risk of incorrect needle placement, need for repeated attempts at placement and unsatisfactory depth of anaesthesia and analgesia in an awake infant. An increasing number of studies have evaluated the use of regional anaesthesia. This updated review contributes to current knowledge on the risks of postoperative respiratory dysfunction in former preterm infants with inguinal hernia who have received regional or general anaesthesia or both, to assist anaesthetists, neonatologists, paediatric surgeons and parents in making decisions on the best anaesthetic approach.</P>

The authors excluded significant chronic lung disease, known symptomatic congenital heart disease or symptomatic central nervous system disease. Preoperative respiratory function of the included infants was assessed by a 12 hour study of respiratory rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation and ECG in the infant's home. On the day of surgery 10 infants received a single shot of spinal anaesthetic with 0.6 mg/kg tetracaine hydrochloride made hyperbaric with an equal volume of 10% dextrose. Three infants in the spinal group who cried during surgical manipulation received brief mask blow-over of 50% nitrous oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O). In the general anaesthesia group, eight infants received balanced anaesthesia, with halothane and muscle relaxation. At the end of the surgery the ilioinguinal nerve was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine for pain relief. When necessary, at the conclusion of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was antagonised with neostigmine and atropine. One infant in the spinal anaesthetic group had inadequate spinal anaesthetic blockade and was then given a general anaesthetic in addition to a local nerve block. The outcome measures of postoperative apnoea (cessation of respiratory movement for more than 10 seconds), bradycardia and periodic breathing were reported to be equal in each group, but individual data were not supplied. Postoperative haemoglobin oxygen desaturation (a decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>) to less than 90% for 10 seconds or more), anaesthetic placement failure and anaesthetic agent failure were measured and reported for the two groups.

They did not exclude any infants on entry criteria but excluded from analysis those infants in whom failure to achieve spinal needle placement occurred. On the day of surgery, 20 infants received a spinal anaesthetic with isobaric bupivacaine 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg. A pacifier was used to soothe restless infants. In the general anaesthesia group 20 infants received thiopentone intravenous induction, 4 to 5 mg/kg, followed by balanced anaesthesia of halothane 0.5% to 1.5% and muscle relaxation with atracurium, 0.5 mg/kg. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed at the end of surgery with neostigmine and atropine. The outcome measures were postoperative apnoea (defined as a respiratory pause of 15 seconds or longer; or less than 15 seconds with bradycardia (defined as a heart rate of less than 100 beats/minute)); postoperative analgesia; postoperative respiratory support; average length of hospital stay; anaesthetic placement failure; and multiple spinal placement attempts. Six infants in the spinal anaesthesia group became restless despite successful spinal blockade and supplementary anaesthesia was administered to obtain sufficient motionlessness for completion of the operative procedure: four infants received inhaled halothane and two received intravenous propofol.

The authors excluded infants who had cardiac, neurological or metabolic disease and those who were receiving methylxanthines or caffeine. In the spinal anaesthesia group, during the early part of the study, nine infants received intramuscular ketamine for sedation prior to performance of lumbar puncture. These results were presented separately. As the authors gained experience the ketamine sedation was stopped due to the high incidence of side effects observed. The remaining 11 infants in the spinal group were comforted with sugar solution. In all infants the spinal anaesthesia was achieved by 1% tetracaine 0.4 to 0.6 mg/kg with an equal volume of 10% dextrose. The 16 infants in the general anaesthesia group received a balanced anaesthetic with halothane and neuromuscular blockade. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed at the end of surgery with neostigmine and atropine.

<P>Overall, the studies included in this review were of inadequate quality. Due to the nature of the intervention contrast, it was deemed impractical to blind the intervention in any of the studies. Three of the five studies attempted to account for this by using blinded assessment. Specific methodological issues of individual trials are discussed below:</P>

There was complete follow-up of all enrolled infants. One infant with a failed spinal anaesthetic who subsequently received a general anaesthetic was counted as a member of the general anaesthetic group.

<BR/>Randomisation in this study was inadequately described. Allocation concealment was not mentioned and there was no blinding of either intervention or outcome.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1990</LINK>
<BR/>Randomisation in this study was inadequately described. Allocation concealment was not mentioned and there was no blinding of intervention, but a pulmonologist unaware of treatment group assessed outcome. There was complete follow-up. Subgroup analyses were performed, with and without pre-anaesthetic ketamine sedation, in the spinal group, following initial concerns by study investigators that pre-anaesthetic sedation contributed to greater incidence of postoperative apnoea.

Randomisation in this study was inadequately described. There was no mention of allocation concealment, blinding of intervention or outcome assessment. Although the number analysed equalled those initially randomised, follow-up is assessed as incomplete due to the exclusion of an unspecified number of cases with inadequate block. Whether cases of inadequate block were excluded pre- or postrandomisation was not mentioned. Two cases in the spinal group requiring nitrous oxide via mask inhalation were analysed as intention to treat.</P>

<P>All five studies in this review reported on the impact of spinal versus general anaesthesia in preterm infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy. The five studies reported different postoperative outcomes. Where different studies reported similar outcomes there was no significant heterogeneity of treatment effect between the studies. However, due to the small number of studies and participants in a proportion of the meta-analyses, a complete lack of heterogeneity cannot be assumed.</P>

Although each study indicated a higher incidence of agent failure in the spinal group, none of these studies when considered separately reached statistical significance. In the meta-analysis, infants who received a spinal anaesthetic had a statistically significantly greater risk of failure of anaesthesia arising from the anaesthetic agent, compared to those receiving general anaesthesia (typical RR 7.83, 95% CI 1.51 to 40.58; 3 studies, 92 infants).

<P>The 2015 update identified two new randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Gohary-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El-Gohary 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Das-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Das 2005</LINK>), only one of which was eligible for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Gohary-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El-Gohary 2004</LINK>), bringing the total number of eligible studies in this review to five enrolling 152 infants in total (<LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krane-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Krane 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Somri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Gohary-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El-Gohary 2004</LINK>). Spinal anaesthesia was no more effective than general anaesthesia in reducing the overall incidence of postoperative morbidity. However, once infants receiving ketamine in the <LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1990</LINK> study were excluded from the analysis there was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of episodes of postoperative apnoea in the spinal anaesthetic group. For every four infants treated with spinal anaesthesia one infant was prevented from having an episode of postoperative apnoea. Infants with episodes of postoperative apnoea but no episodes of preoperative apnoea and receiving spinal rather than general anaesthesia had a similar reduction in episodes of postoperative apnoea.</P>
<P>Anaesthetic failure was analysed in three categories: anaesthetic placement failure; anaesthetic agent failure; and repeated attempts to achieve successful placement of anaesthesia. Overall, there were more technical failures in the spinal group. Accurate placement of the spinal needle occurred in one infant in every seven scheduled to receive a spinal anaesthetic. For every four infants having a spinal anaesthetic, one experienced an anaesthetic agent failure requiring additional anaesthetic agent. None of the studies addressed the issue of why there were so many technical failures and they did not describe the degree of training or pre-study experience of the anaesthetic staff involved in the placement of spinal catheters.</P>
<P>The potential benefits of a reduction in postoperative apnoea need to be considered alongside a one in seven likelihood of failing to achieve the accurate placement of a spinal needle and a one in four chance of anaesthetic agent failure associated with spinal anaesthesia.</P>

<P>The included studies reported both short and long episodes of postoperative apnoea. For the purpose of this systematic review, we concentrated on long episodes of postoperative apnoea. Three of the studies used a definition for apnoea as 'a cessation in breathing for 15 seconds, or less if associated with bradycardia'; and in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Krane-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Krane 1995</LINK>, a definition of '10 seconds, or less if associated with bradycardia' was used. None of these definitions fulfilled the <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1987</LINK> definition of apnoea or the criteria prespecified in this review.</P>
<P>Continuous outcome variables for length of surgery, average length of hospital stay and temperature on admission to recovery were reported as means. No standard deviations and confidence intervals were available, therefore our interpretation is based on the conclusions of the individual authors.</P>
<P>Neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported in any of the randomised trials included in this review. As discussed in the background of this review, the effect of general anaesthesia exposure on longer term brain development and function are of great importance in the preterm infant population.</P>
<P>Important outcomes to measure in future studies include neurosensory impairment and anaesthetic effectiveness (operator satisfaction, any anaesthetic failure) in order to better evaluate the effect of anaesthetic-sedative agents on the growing brain balanced with the practicalities and technical challenges of achieving adequate anaesthesia to allow sufficient infant immobility during surgery.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-25 04:24:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence that spinal anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of postoperative apnoea by up to 47% in ex-preterm infants not receiving additional sedative or analgesic agents whilst undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy. For every four infants treated, spinal anaesthesia may prevent one infant from having postoperative apnoea (NNTB=4). There was low-quality evidence of a reduction in postoperative apnoea by up to 66% in infants with no prior history of apnoea and receiving spinal rather than general anaesthetic. There was very low-quality evidence of greater risk of anaesthetic agent failure and anaesthetic placement failure when regional anaesthesia was used, with the latter being of borderline statistical significance. None of the trials located in this review reported on neurodevelopmental outcomes. There is currently no evidence from randomised trials to confirm or deny that brief exposure to general anaesthesia affects longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes in former preterm infants undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-22 09:45:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although observational studies indicate a potential for neurotoxicity and brain cell destruction in preterm infants receiving sedative and anaesthetic agents, this has not been examined in randomised trials of general, compared with regional, anaesthesia in former preterm infants. There is a clear need for randomised trials evaluating the risk of postoperative apnoea and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in ex-preterm infants in association with general anaesthesia. It is important for such trials to examine whether the risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes is higher in infants with a history of severe respiratory disease or previous brain injury or both compared to lower risk infants, and whether either or both groups of infants may benefit from reduced exposure to anaesthetic agents.</P>
<P>The relative safety of newer generation rapid onset and offset general anaesthetic agents requires further examination. Older generation inhalational anaesthetic agents have the potential to expose the lungs, heart and brain of former preterm infants to greater toxicity compared with newer generational agents but this has not been tested. Large randomised trials comparing contemporary general with spinal anaesthetic approaches without the co-administration of sedative agents are needed in order to evaluate this.</P>
<P>Inguinal hernia operations are associated with comparatively low requirement for postoperative analgesics and are traditionally treated with low-level analgesic agents such as paracetamol. Trials involving alternative types of neonatal surgery gastrointestinal approaches, such as <LINK REF="STD-Somri-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Somri 2011</LINK>, may provide a better comparison of postoperative analgesic effectiveness between general and spinal anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Randomised trials should provide complete descriptions of randomisation techniques, allocation concealment, and methods of blinding participants and assessors. Outcome definitions should be prespecified and consistently applied across all study centres. Anaesthetic staff responsible for placement of spinal anaesthetics and surgical staff involved in inguinal hernia repair surgery should receive training and assessment prior to study commencement. Follow-up outcomes should be analysed as intention to treat, with complete reporting on withdrawals or cross-over of treatments. All measured outcomes should be reported.</P>
<P>Larger studies are needed to identify the risk benefit ratio of spinal anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. To reduce the risk of postoperative apnoea between regional and general anaesthesia by at least 10% would require a total sample size of 155 infants (90% power and alpha = 0.05) . If apnoea incidence is truly as low as 5% with the newer inhalational anaesthetics, then at least 242 infants would be required to detect a statistically significant difference between regional and general anaesthesia. These sample sizes highlight the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial.</P>
<P>The GAS Study is a multi-centre trial that has recently completed recruitment of 722 infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy repair (<LINK REF="STD-NCT0075660" TYPE="STUDY">NCT0075660</LINK>). Infants were randomised to regional anaesthesia versus combined general and regional anaesthesia. In addition to neurosensory outcomes at two years corrected age, investigators intend to follow longer term intelligence quotients of study infants at five years corrected age.</P>

Depending on clinician preference, additional local anaesthetic techniques were used for postoperative analgesia. The infant's condition and behaviour was recorded regularly intra-operatively and in the early postoperative period up to discharge from hospital. Parents were also contacted about 5 days postoperatively and questioned regarding potential complications of the technique.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-04-07 21:45:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preliminary results: awake spinal anaesthesia was the predominant choice in the regional group with 339/355 infants receiving this technique; of these 109 also had an additional caudal block. For 279/339 (82%) cases the spinal (± caudal) anaesthesia was sufficient on its own for the completion of surgery; in 18/355 (5%) cases some form of additional sedation or brief exposure to sevoflurane was required; and in 42/355 (12%) cases the block was a complete failure and a full general anaesthetic was required.</P>
