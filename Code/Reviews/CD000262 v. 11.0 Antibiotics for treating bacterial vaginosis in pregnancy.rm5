<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-14 14:03:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bacteria are normally present in the birth canal and are useful in maintaining the health of the vagina. However, if the numbers of some of the bacteria increase, this is called bacterial vaginosis. For some women, there are no symptoms but for others it may cause an unpleasant discharge and may cause some babies to be born too early. These babies can suffer from problems related to their immaturity both in the weeks following birth such as breathing difficulty, infection and bleeding within the brain as well as problems when growing up such as poor growth, chronic lung disease and delayed development.</P>
<P>The review looked to see whether the use of antibiotics in women with bacterial vaginosis reduced the symptoms for women and reduced the incidence of babies being born too early.  We identified  21 trials, involving 7847 women.  We found that antibiotics given to pregnant women reduced this overgrowth of bacteria, but did not reduce the numbers of babies who were born too early. There were adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment or have the treatment changed when antibiotics were used and this needs further investigation. The effect of screening and treating women with abnormal flora needs to be studied in further trials and the effects of screening and treating proven vaginal infections is the subject of another Cochrane review.</P>

<P>Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Women may have symptoms of a characteristic vaginal discharge but are often asymptomatic.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-14 14:03:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 21 trials of good quality, involving 7847 women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.</P>
<P>Antibiotic therapy was shown to be effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials, 4403 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 91%). Antibiotic treatment also reduced the risk of late miscarriage (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76; two trials, 1270 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%).</P>
<P>Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 13 trials, 6491 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 48%), or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.84; two trials, 493 women). It did increase the risk of side-effects sufficient to stop or change treatment (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.68; four trials, 2323 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%).</P>
<P>In this updated review, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation did not reduce the risk of PTB less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; five trials, 4088 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 49%).</P>
<P>In women with a previous PTB, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent PTB (average RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.48; three trials, 421 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 72%).</P>
<P>In women with abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84; two trials, 894 women).</P>
<P>One small trial of 156 women compared metronidazole and clindamycin, both oral and vaginal, with no significant differences seen for any of the pre-specified primary outcomes. Statistically significant differences were seen for the outcomes of prolongation of gestational age (days) (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.74) and birthweight (grams) (MD 75.18; 95% CI 25.37 to 124.99) however these represent relatively small differences in the clinical setting.</P>
<P>Oral antibiotics versus vaginal antibiotics did not reduce the risk of PTB (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.52; two trials, 264 women). Oral antibiotics had some advantage over vaginal antibiotics (whether metronidazole or clindamycin) with respect to admission to neonatal unit (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.92, one trial, 156 women), prolongation of gestational age (days) (MD 9.00; 95% CI 8.20 to 9.80; one trial, 156 women) and birthweight (grams) (MD 342.13; 95% CI 293.04 to 391.22; one trial, 156 women).</P>
<P>Different frequency of dosing of antibiotics was assessed in one small trial and showed no significant difference for any outcome assessed.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-29 13:47:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. The overall risk of PTB was not significantly reduced. This review provides little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis will prevent PTB and its consequences. When screening criteria were broadened to include women with abnormal flora there was a 47% reduction in preterm birth, however this is limited to two included studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-14 14:28:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-14 14:03:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of vaginal flora caused by a reduction of the normal lactobacillary bacteria, and a heavy overgrowth of mixed anaerobic flora including <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>, <I>Mycoplasma hominis</I> and <I>Mobiluncus species</I>. Why these organisms multiply, many of which are normally present in small numbers in the vagina, while the usually prevalent lactobacilli decrease, is not clear. The role of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli appears to be important in preventing overgrowth of anaerobes in normal vaginal flora (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1993</LINK>). Bacterial vaginosis does not appear to be sexually transmitted but may be associated with sexual activity.</P>
<P>Bacterial vaginosis is often asymptomatic but may result in a vaginal discharge which can be grey in colour with a characteristic 'fishy' odour. It is not associated with vaginal mucosal inflammation and rarely causes vulval itch.</P>
<P>The classical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is confirmed by fulfilling three out of four criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Amsel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsel 1983</LINK>). These are (i) a vaginal pH greater than 4.7, (ii) the presence of 'clue cells' on a Gram stain or wet mount of the vaginal discharge, (iii) the presence of a thin homogenous discharge and (iv) the release of a fishy odour when potassium hydroxide is added to a sample of the discharge. The use of these criteria for diagnosis, however, is complex and time consuming in some settings. Use of a Gram stain of a vaginal swab with semi-quantification of the microbial flora has high sensitivity and specificity and is an accepted alternative method which has been used in many studies due to ease of standardisation, ability to be read at a later date and potential to be blinded (<LINK REF="REF-Nugent-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nugent 1991</LINK>). In the Nugent system, the numbers of different bacterial morphotypes in Gram stained smears are counted in high power fields using microscopy with a 1000x magnification. The points achieved from the number of different bacterial morphotypes are added together, with a total score of zero to three considered normal and a score of seven to 10 consistent with bacterial vaginosis. A score of four to six is classified as intermediate.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history in pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Bacterial vaginosis is present in up to 20% of women during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lamont-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 1993</LINK>). The majority of these cases will be asymptomatic. The natural history of bacterial vaginosis is such that it may spontaneously resolve without treatment although most women identified as having bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy are likely to have persistent infection later in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Association with adverse outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There is now a substantial body of evidence associating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy with poor perinatal outcome, in particular an increased risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurki-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurki 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1990</LINK>), with potential neonatal sequelae due to prematurity. A recent meta-analysis of adverse outcomes associated with bacterial vaginosis and including over 30,000 women from 32 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Leitich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 2007</LINK>) showed that bacterial vaginosis approximately doubled the risk of preterm delivery in asymptomatic patients (odds ratio (OR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 3.00) as well as significantly increased the risks of late miscarriage (OR 6.32, 95% CI 3.65 to 10.94) and maternal infection (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.08). There is also evidence associating intermediate flora with adverse pregnancy outcome<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Donders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donders 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leitich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 2007</LINK>). Although intra-amniotic infection has a clear causal relationship with preterm delivery mediated via pattern recognition receptors, chemokines or inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Lamont-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 2011b</LINK>), the exact mechanism by which by which the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis may effect the initiation of preterm labour remains unclear. It is also unclear why bacterial vaginosis is associated with preterm birth in some women but not in others with recent studies suggesting individual immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamont-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 2011a</LINK>) or specific gene polymorphisms (<LINK REF="REF-Annells-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annells 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Annells-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annells 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simhan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simhan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witkin 2003</LINK>) are responsible for individual susceptibility. Whilst a number of other genital micro-organisms such as <I>Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes</I> and <I>Viridans streptococci</I> may be involved in chorioamnionitis, carriage of these organisms during early to mid-pregnancy has not been associated with an increased risk of preterm labour. Although maternal carriage of group B S<I>treptococcus</I> increases the risk of neonatal sepsis due to this organism, there is conflicting evidence about whether carriage during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm birth. Infections during pregnancy for which there is good evidence of an increased risk of preterm birth and preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, include asymptomatic bacteriuria, <I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis</I> and bacterial vaginosis. The opportunity therefore exists to reduce the preterm birth rate by treatment of these infections during pregnancy.</P>

<P>Antibiotic treatment aims to reduce the overgrowth of the abnormal anaerobic bacteria, restore the balance of the protective lactobacillary bacteria and prevent the development of an inflammatory response and the initiation of preterm labour.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-13 22:15:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bacterial vaginosis is relatively common, even in populations of women at low risk of adverse events and it is amenable to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Burtin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burtin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischbach-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischbach 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1994</LINK>). Identification during pregnancy and treatment may present a rare opportunity to reduce the preterm birth rate, and resulting risk of prematurity to the newborn. Such treatment may also reduce other adverse perinatal outcomes such as postpartum infection. Much evidence exists to support the association of bacterial vaginosis with preterm birth, however, the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The results of randomised controlled trials of treatment are needed to provide more direct evidence of the role of bacterial vaginosis in preterm birth.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-27 10:43:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-one trials involving 13,209 women were included (of which 7847 women were bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora positive). Many of the prespecified outcomes for this review were not assessed by the included trials. The available evidence from these trials suggests that antibiotic treatment given to women with bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is highly effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials of 4403 women). There was significant heterogeneity between trials for many of the comparisons; therefore, random-effects analyses were used where necessary.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant decrease in the risk of preterm birth (PTB) at less than 37 weeks' gestation for any antibiotic treatment versus no treatment or placebo (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 13 trials, 6491 women). There was also no evidence of an effect on birth before 34 weeks (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.52 to 2.59; three trials of 515 women), nor for an effect on birth before 32 weeks (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.68; four trials of 3565 women). The effect of treatment on the incidence of low birthweight suggests no difference (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.2; seven trials of 4040 women). Antibiotics were not associated with a decrease in the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.84; two trials of 493 women).</P>
<P>In this updated review, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation did not reduce the risk of PTB less than 37 weeks and in women with a previous PTB, again, there was no reduction in the risk of subsequent PTB. However, in women with abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), the evidence from two trials suggests that treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks.</P>
<P>Very few perinatal deaths were reported and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-NICHD-MFMU-2000" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD MFMU 2000</LINK> unpublished) reported substantive measures of neonatal morbidity or economic outcomes such as health service utilisation. There was, however, a substantial reduction in late miscarriage with the use of antibiotics (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76; two trials with 1270 women), but also an increase in side-effects sufficient to stop treatment (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.68; four trials, 2235 women).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-14 14:09:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is now a substantial body of evidence that associates bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy with a poor perinatal outcome, in particular an increased risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Donders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donders 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurki-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurki 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamont-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leitich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1990</LINK>). This strong association between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth has led many researchers and clinicians to believe that bacterial vaginosis may be the cause of preterm birth in these women.</P>
<P>The results of trials that treat bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, however, are not encouraging. This updated review now includes six additional trials, one from this update (<LINK REF="STD-Moniri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moniri 2009</LINK>) and five from the previous update (<LINK REF="STD-Darwish-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Darwish 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giuffrida-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giuffrida 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shennan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shennan 2006</LINK>) and continues to show no significant reduction in preterm birth from 13 trials involving 6491 women. The review has been restructured to make it clearer to see the differences between trials in terms of antibiotic used, frequency and route and whether compared with placebo or another treatment. Subgroup analyses have also been re-done for the subgroups of women with previous preterm birth, intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis or treatment prior to 20 weeks' gestation. The evidence does not now suggest any differential effect between subgroups of women with a previous/no previous preterm birth or treatment before 20 weeks's gestation/after 20 weeks' gestation for the outcomes examined. There is some suggestion that in women identified as having abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks; however, this result comes from only two studies of 894 women.</P>
<P>Interestingly, there is a benefit from antibiotics in terms of an 80% reduction in late miscarriage. This result is from only two trials but does involve 1270 women. Both studies used clindamycin. This finding may be consistent with the increasing evidence that for treatment to be effective it needs to be started early.</P>
<P>In this update however, for the subgroup of women treated before 20 weeks' gestation, there was no evidence of an effect for any of the outcomes examined (preterm delivery less than 37 weeks; low birthweight; side-effects not sufficient to stop treatment; late miscarriage). As there have been no head-to-head comparisons of early versus late treatment, trials in this area are warranted. The only trial large enough to stratify their results by early or later treatment failed to show any difference in effect when comparing earlier versus later treatment, although it could be argued that even in the early group, treatment was not started early enough. A recent meta-analysis of clindamycin treatment of bacterial vaginosis prior to 22 weeks' gestation included five of the studies assessed in this review and demonstrated a significantly reduced risk of preterm birth and late miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Lamont-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 2011b</LINK>). Their results remained significant when sensitivity analysis was performed including two further studies.</P>
<P>The two trials of women with abnormal vaginal flora, i.e. intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis (<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ugwumadu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ugwumadu 2003</LINK>), showed significantly decreased rates of preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation with treatment,<I> </I>which the authors postulate may be due to the earlier gestation of treatment in both these studies (13 to 20 weeks for <LINK REF="STD-Lamont-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 2003</LINK> and 12 to 22 weeks (mean 15.6) (for <LINK REF="STD-Ugwumadu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ugwumadu 2003</LINK>). When analysed as a separate category, antibiotic treatment of abnormal flora resulted in a significant decrease in preterm birth. However, their inclusion in meta-analysis of all the trials has not made a substantial difference to the overall picture.</P>
<P>Additional information on neonatal sepsis from the large NICHD MFMU trial is included in the analysis but provides no evidence of a reduction in neonatal sepsis.</P>
<P>Significant heterogeneity was found in several analyses; in the 'failure of test of cure' analysis this is probably due to differences in the timing of the test of cure and the method for determining test of cure. Also, trials in this review have used several different methods of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis or abnormal genital flora (Amsel or clinical criteria, Gram stain criteria, and abnormal Nugent score four to 10).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the trials</HEADING>
<P>The trial protocols differ in a number of ways such as the method for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, timing of screening, timing of treatment, and the period between screening and treatment. Most trials have tested treatment in the second trimester; some as late as 28 weeks' gestation. This may be too late to prevent the consequences of any ascending infection and may be one of the main reasons for the observed lack of a statistically significant effect on the preterm birth rates. The efficacy of antibiotic treatment in long-term eradication of bacterial vaginosis is at best 80%. The subgroups of women in whom bacterial vaginosis was successfully eradicated, and those with recurring bacterial vaginosis, need to be identified and studied more closely in future trials.</P>
<P>Most trials have concentrated on the timing of birth and have made the assumption that the later in gestation a baby is born, the greater are its chances of disability-free survival. This may not be the case, however. Neonatal well being and measures of maternal postpartum morbidity were each reported by two trials. However, the majority of outcomes we considered important for this review were not mentioned.</P>
<P>Since the first publication of the earlier Cochrane review in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1998</LINK>), the number of women in this meta-analysis has more than trebled, largely due to the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-MFMU-2000" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD MFMU 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NICHD-MFMU-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NICHD MFMU 2001</LINK> studies with 2132 women. This fourth review has increased the trial numbers by 1294. There remains no clear evidence that screening and treating <I>all </I>women with bacterial vaginosis in the antenatal period will have a major impact on the consequences of preterm birth, however the area of screening and treating abnormal flora deserves further investigation.<BR/>

<P>The evidence to date does not suggest any benefit in screening and treating all pregnant women for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth. The lack of a significant effect despite large numbers of women in the included trials may be due to many differences within the trials regarding diagnosis, timing of treatment and antibiotic choice. In considering the implications for clinical practice it should be remembered, however, that many of the trials excluded women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis due to treatment of their symptoms with antibiotics. These women, especially those with recurrent or persistent bacterial vaginosis, may be at highest risk of associated adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, from studies to date we know almost nothing about the impact of these interventions on the health of the baby.</P>
<P>At the present time, there seems little justification for initiating a policy of screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. Any impact may be dependent upon early detection and treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-16 20:00:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The consequences of preterm birth to the individuals concerned and the health services are of major importance. Any intervention with the potential to decrease the risk of mortality and morbidity associated with neonatal immaturity, therefore, needs prompt and appropriate evaluation so that any benefits may be maximised. The focus of current research is to identify those subgroups of pregnant women who are at highest risk for adverse sequelae of bacterial vaginosis. These subgroups include women with recurrent or persistent bacterial vaginosis. Individual susceptibility to preterm birth may also be increased by the presence of specific gene polymorphisms, producing a heightened inflammatory response to vaginal or intrauterine infection. In addition, recent findings suggest future studies may need to focus on earlier detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis in the first trimester of pregnancy, or even preconception.</P>
<P>What then remains to be demonstrated is that a policy for screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy can reduce substantive measures of morbidity associated with neonatal immaturity, and that this results in cost savings to families and the health services. Large trials are needed which can determine the effect of a screening programme on neonatal mortality and major measures of morbidity such as intracranial damage and chronic lung disease. For example, in the NICHD MFMU trial, to reduce the incidence of neonatal morbidity by 25% (1.9% to 1.4%) with 90% power, significant at the 5% level, would require recruitment of at least 28,000 women.</P>
<P>Identification of specific subgroups who may benefit most from treatment may be improved further by an individual patient data analysis of the trials included in this review. If the detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis can be shown to improve neonatal outcome, further trials will be necessary to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The Investigational Drug Service at the University of Washington performed the randomisation and provided the treatment assignments in opaque, sealed envelopes. According to the Cochrane Handbook, <A HREF="http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/">http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/</A>, methods using envelopes are more susceptible to manipulation than other approaches (Schulz 1995). If investigators use envelopes, they should develop and monitor the allocation process to preserve concealment. In addition to use of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, they should ensure that the envelopes are opened sequentially, and only after the envelope has been irreversibly assigned to the participant. No mention was made of numbering and sequential opening in the article, thus the adequacy of allocation concealment was unclear.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-08-16 03:00:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>I have a couple of minor technical corrections. First, the NICHD trial (NICHD MFMU 2000) randomised women from 16 to 24 weeks, not from 18 to 24 weeks. In fact, these women were randomised not much later than those in Ugwumadu 2003.</P>
<P>Second, women with bacterial vaginosis plus Trichomonas were not eligible for the NICHD study included in this review. However, they were randomised into a parallel NICHD Trichomonas study .(1] In that study, we presented results separately for women who had Trichomonas only and women who had Trichomonas plus bacterial vaginosis. Since many other bacterial vaginosis trials did not screen for Trichomonas, and therefore probably randomised some women who had both, there is no reason to exclude such women recruited to our second study from your review.</P>
<P>Finally, our original draft of the paper for NICHD MFMU 2000 included data on neonatal mortality and morbidity. This table was removed at the request of the NEJM Editor. If you wish, I can investigate whether we can provide you with this additional data.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you very much for your comments. We have addressed each of your points in this update as follows:<BR/>(1) the information about NICHD MFMU 2000 is now correct, women were enrolled between 16 to 24 weeks;<BR/>(2) we have included the published data from the NICHD Trichomonas study (NICHD MFMU 2001);<BR/>(3) data from NICHD MFMU 2000 on neonatal mortality and morbidity supplied by the authors have been included.</P>

<P>We selected all potential trials for eligibility according to the criteria specified in the protocol. Each of the review authors independently abstracted the information necessary for the review from the report and, where necessary, we sought additional information from the authors.</P>
<P>We assessed all trials for methodological quality using the standard Cochrane criteria. As there are a sufficient number of trials in the review, we stratified the trials by quality to explore the robustness of the findings. We calculated summary Peto odds ratios when appropriate (i.e. there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity) using the Cochrane Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stratified analysis</HEADING>
<P>As there are sufficient trials in the review, the comparisons are<I> </I>stratified to explore the effect of the intervention on the outcomes by the following factors:</P>
<OL>
<LI>oral versus vaginal antibiotics;</LI>
<LI>women with a previous preterm birth;</LI>
<LI>women with intermediate flora/bacterial vaginosis;</LI>
<LI>clindamycin versus placebo treatment;</LI>
<LI>treatment before 20 weeks' gestation.</LI>
</OL>
<P>It was not possible to stratify results into symptomatic versus asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis because in most trials, women with symptoms were treated with antibiotics and were therefore excluded.</P>
