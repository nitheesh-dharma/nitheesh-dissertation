<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and partial onset seizures in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain).</P>
<P>For around 70% of people with epilepsy, a single antiepileptic drug can control generalised onset or partial onset seizures. Worldwide, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are commonly used antiepileptic drugs; however, carbamazepine is used more commonly in the USA and Europe because of concerns over side-effects associated with phenobarbitone, particularly concerns over behavioural changes in children treated with phenobarbitone. Phenobarbitone is still commonly used in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America because of the low cost of the drug.</P>
<P>
<B>Review methods</B>
</P>
<P>In this review, we evaluated the evidence from 13 randomised controlled clinical trials comparing phenobarbitone with carbamazepine based on how effective the drugs were at controlling seizures (i.e. whether people had recurrence of seizures or had long periods of freedom from seizures (remission)) and how tolerable any related side-effects of the drugs were. We were able to combine data for 836 people from six of the 13 trials; for the remaining 619 people from seven trials, data were not available to use in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Results of the review suggest that people are more likely to withdraw from phenobarbitone treatment earlier than from carbamazepine treatment, because of seizure recurrence, side-effects of the drug, or both. Results also suggest that recurrence of seizures after starting treatment with phenobarbitone may happen earlier than treatment with carbamazepine for people with generalised seizures, but vice-versa for people with partial onset seizures. We found no difference between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone for people achieving long periods of seizure freedom (six- or 12-month remission of seizures).</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>We recommend that the results of this review are interpreted with caution as we were unable to combine the data for all people treated in trials comparing carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. Also, for four of the six trials used in our results, we found at least one problem in the design of the trial, which may have impacted upon the quality of the results of the individual trials, and therefore our results from combining trial data. We judge that the quality of the evidence in this review is low and we do not recommend using the results of this review alone for making a choice between carbamazepine or phenobarbitone for the treatment of epilepsy. We recommend that all future trials comparing these drugs or any other antiepileptic drugs should be designed using high quality methods to ensure results are also of high quality.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:31:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:25:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review, first published in Issue 1, 2003 and updated in 2015. This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy.</P>
<P>Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are commonly used broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures, and is used in the USA and Europe. Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first-line treatment because of concerns over associated adverse events, particularly documented behavioural adverse events in children treated with the drug. However, phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low- and middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:25:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the time to withdrawal, remission, and first seizure of carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:25:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 18 August 2016: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946), the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (<A HREF="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>). Previously we also searched SCOPUS (from 1823) as an alternative to Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:25:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to achieve 12-month remission', 'time to achieve six-month remission', 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', and 'adverse events'. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with the generic inverse variance method used to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:30:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IPD were available for 836 participants out of 1455 eligible individuals from six out of 13 trials; 57% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, HR &gt; 1 indicated an advantage for phenobarbitone, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR &gt; 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine.</P>
<P>The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type, 95% CI) were HR 1.50 for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (95% CI 1.15 to 1.95; P = 0.003); HR 0.93 for time to achieve 12-month remission (95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; P = 0.57); HR 0.99 for time to achieve six-month remission (95% CI 0.80 to 1.23; P = 0.95); and HR 0.87 for time to first seizure (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06; P = 0.18). Results suggest an advantage for carbamazepine over phenobarbitone in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and no statistically significant evidence between the drugs for the other outcomes. We found evidence of a statistically significant interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (Chi² test for subgroup differences P = 0.03), where phenobarbitone was favoured for partial onset seizures (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.96; P = 0.02) and carbamazepine was favoured for generalised onset seizures (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.77; P = 0.27). We found no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for the other outcomes. However, methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with 10 out of the 13 included studies (4 out of 6 studies contributing IPD) judged at high risk of bias for at least one methodological aspect, leading to variable individual study results, and therefore, heterogeneity in the analyses of this review. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of poor methodological aspects, where possible.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:31:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, we found evidence suggestive of an advantage for carbamazepine in terms of drug effectiveness compared with phenobarbitone (retention of the drug in terms of seizure control and adverse events) and evidence suggestive of an association between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (phenobarbitone favoured for partial seizures and carbamazepine favoured for generalised seizures). However, this evidence was judged to be of low quality due to poor methodological quality and the potential impact on individual study results (and therefore variability (heterogeneity) present in the analysis within this review), we encourage caution when interpreting the results of this review and do not advocate that the results of this review alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with considerations for allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review, first published in Issue 1, 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2003</LINK>), and updated in 2015. </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:26:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a disorder of many heterogenous seizure types, with an estimated incidence of 33 to 57 per 100,000 person-years worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Annegers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annegers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirtz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirtz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olafsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olafsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>), accounting for approximately 1% of the global burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lifetime risk of epilepsy onset is estimated to be 1300 to 4000 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul_x002d_Jenson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul-Jenson 1983</LINK>), and the lifetime prevalence could be as large as 70 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ngugi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngugi 2010</LINK>). It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 2004</LINK>), and around 70% of individuals can achieve seizure freedom using a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that both adults and children with epilepsy should be treated with monotherapy, wherever possible (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). The remaining 30% of individuals experience refractory or drug-resistant seizures, which often require treatment with combinations of antiepileptic drugs or alternative treatments, such as epilepsy surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We studied two seizure types in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and partial onset seizures in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-17 12:03:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are among the most commonly used and earliest drugs licensed for the treatment of epileptic seizures; phenobarbitone has been used as monotherapy for partial seizures and generalised tonic-clonic seizures for over 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Gruber-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruber 1962</LINK>), and carbamazepine, for over 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Shakir-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shakir 1980</LINK>). Current NICE guidelines for adults and children recommend carbamazepine as a first-line treatment for partial onset seizures and as a second-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures if first-line treatments, sodium valproate and lamotrigine, are deemed unsuitable (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). However, there is evidence that carbamazepine may exacerbate some other generalised seizure types, such as myoclonic and absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first-line treatment in the USA and most of Europe because of concerns over short- and long-term tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1997</LINK>); particularly in children, there is concern about behavioural disturbance caused by phenobarbitone (<LINK REF="REF-Trimble-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trimble 1988</LINK>). One open-label paediatric study in the UK, <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, withdrew the phenobarbitone arm of the trial because of concerns about behavioural problems and difficulties getting paediatricians to randomise individuals. However, the largest reported randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating phenobarbitone as monotherapy in adults with partial seizures, <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, did not find phenobarbitone to be more associated with adverse events than other study drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone). In fact, phenobarbitone was significantly associated with the lowest incidence of motor disturbances (ataxia (lack of voluntary co-ordination of muscle movements), incoordination, nystagmus, and tremor) and gastrointestinal problems.</P>

Two paediatric trials conducted in Bangladesh (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>), and rural India (<LINK REF="REF-Pal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pal 1998</LINK>), comparing phenobarbitone with carbamazepine and phenytoin, respectively, found no excess in behavioural side-effects from phenobarbitone, but a trial in Nigerian adults (<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>), showed evidence of an association between phenobarbitone and worsening of cognitive impairments, particularly memory deficits.</P>
<P>Both carbamazepine and phenobarbitone have been shown to have teratogenic (disturbances to foetal development) effects, where the risk is estimated to be two to three times that of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>); carbamazepine is associated particularly with neural tube defects (<LINK REF="REF-Matlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matlow 2012</LINK>), and phenobarbitone is associated with low folic acid levels and megaloblastic anaemia (anaemia characterised by many large immature and dysfunctional red blood cells; <LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>). In addition to concerns over behavioural and cognitive adverse events, phenobarbitone is commonly associated with somnolence (sedation) and connective tissue abnormalities, such as Dupuytren's contracture and frozen shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Baulac-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baulac 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>The aim of this review was to summarise efficacy and tolerability data from existing trials comparing carbamazepine and phenobarbitone when used as monotherapy treatments. The adverse event profiles of the two drugs are well documented (see example references from <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK>), and the largest reported RCT investigating carbamazepine and phenobarbitone as monotherapy in adults with partial seizures, <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, found carbamazepine to be significantly better at controlling seizures than phenobarbitone, but other trials, including trials recruiting individuals with generalised onset seizures, have found no differences in efficacy between the two drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bidabadi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bidabadi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cossu-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cossu 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>). Although individual studies have found no consistent differences in efficacy, the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide, and they have not excluded important differences in efficacy, which synthesising the data of the individual trials may show.</P>
<P>There are difficulties in undertaking a review of epilepsy monotherapy trials, as the important efficacy outcomes require analysis of time-to-event data (for example, time to first seizure after randomisation). Although methods have been developed to synthesise time-to-event data using summary information (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>), the appropriate statistics are not commonly reported in published epilepsy trials (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013a</LINK>). Furthermore, although most epilepsy monotherapy trials collect seizure data, there has been no uniformity in the definition and reporting of outcomes. For example, trials may report time to 12-month remission but not time to first seizure or vice versa, or some trials may define time to first seizure from the date of randomisation while others use the date of achieving maintenance dose. Trial investigators have also adopted differing approaches to the analysis, particularly with respect to the censoring of time-to-event data. For these reasons, we performed this review using individual participant data (IPD), which helps to overcome these problems. This review is one in a series of Cochrane IPD Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. These data have also been included in a network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), undertaken following a previous version of this review.</P>

<P>For each trial for which we did not obtain IPD, we carried out an assessment to see whether any relevant aggregate level data had been reported or could be indirectly estimated using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>Three studies involving 804 participants, provided seizure data in terms of the number of seizures recorded between each follow-up visit rather than specific dates of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>). To enable the calculation of time-to-event outcomes, we applied linear interpolation to approximate dates of seizures between follow-up visits. For example, if the study recorded four seizures between two visits that occurred on 1 March 1990 and 1 May 1990 (interval of 61 days), then the date of first seizure would be approximately 13 March 1990. This allowed the computation of an estimate of the time to six-month remission, 12-month remission, and first seizure.</P>
<P>We calculated time to six-month and 12-month remission from the date of randomisation to the date (or estimated date) that the individual had first been free of seizures for six or 12 months, respectively. If the person had one or more seizures in the titration period, a six-month or 12-month seizure-free period could also occur between the estimated date of the last seizure in the titration period and the estimated date of the first seizure in the maintenance period.</P>
<P>We calculated time to first seizure from the date of randomisation to the date that we estimated their first seizure to have occurred. If seizure data were missing for a particular visit, we censored these outcomes at the previous visit. We also censored these outcomes if the individual died or if follow-up ceased prior to the occurrence of the event of interest. We used these methods in the remaining four trials involving 326 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>), for which we directly received outcome data (dates of seizures after randomisation).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> trial, all 37 participants completed the 12-week trial duration without withdrawing from the study. For four trials (685 participants), we extracted dates and reason for treatment withdrawal from trial case report forms for the original review (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from all case report forms, resolving disagreements by reconsidering the case report forms at conference. For the analysis of time-to-event, we defined an 'event' as either the withdrawal of the allocated treatment because of poor seizure control, adverse events, or both. We also classed non-compliance with the treatment regimen or the addition of another antiepileptic drug as 'events'. We censored the outcome if treatment was withdrawn because the individual achieved a period of remission or if the individual was still on allocated treatment at the end of follow-up. The <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> trial (108 participants), provided the reason for withdrawal of allocated treatment and date of last follow-up visit. Withdrawal of allocated treatment did not always coincide with date of last follow-up visit (i.e. several participants had the allocated treatment substituted for the other trial drug and continued to be followed up). Dates of withdrawal of allocated treatment could not be provided; therefore, we could not include participants from this trial in the outcome 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-10-06 19:55:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out our analysis on an intention-to-treat basis (that is, we analysed participants in the group to which they were randomised, irrespective of which treatment they actually received). Therefore, for the time-to-event outcomes 'time to six-month remission', 'time to 12-month remission', and 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', we did not censor participants if treatment was withdrawn.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we investigated the relationship between the time-to-event and treatment effect of the antiepileptic drugs. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of log (HR) or treatment effect and associated standard errors in statistical SAS software, version 9.2.The model assumes that the ratio of hazards (risks) between the two treatment groups is constant over time (i.e. hazards are proportional). We tested this proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model for each outcome of each study by testing the statistical significance of a time-varying covariate in the model. We evaluated overall estimates of HRs (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) using the generic inverse variance method in MetaView. We expressed results as a HR and a 95% CI.</P>
<P>By convention, a HR greater than 1 indicates that an event is more likely to occur earlier on carbamazepine than on phenobarbitone. Hence, for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment or time to first seizure, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for phenobarbitone (e.g. a HR of 1.2 would suggest a 20% increase in risk of withdrawal from carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone), and for time to six-month and 12-month remission, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> concealed allocation via opaque sealed envelopes; however, the trial did not use this method for all trial participants.

Therefore, we performed sensitivity analyses for outcomes 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' and 'time to first seizure', respectively, to investigate any impact of these inconsistencies on our results. For <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, we compared reason for withdrawal in the data provided with reasons reported in the publication and performed a sensitivity analysis of those withdrawals that we classed as 'events' or 'censored observations' (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> for further details). Regarding <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, we did not have sufficient information to examine the classification of participants as 'events' and 'censored observations' in the analysis of 'time to first seizure'; therefore, we performed a simple sensitivity analysis excluding data from <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> from the outcome of 'time to first seizure' and observed any change to results and conclusions.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> withdrew the phenobarbitone arm of the trial after 10 children were randomised to phenobarbitone due to concerns over unacceptable side-effects. The trial did not randomise any further children to phenobarbitone and continued with the three other treatment arms: carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sodium valproate. For the primary and secondary outcomes of this review, we included all children randomised to carbamazepine (n = 54) and phenobarbitone (n = 10) from <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, and to account for the imbalance between children randomised to the two drugs on this trial, we performed sensitivity analysis including only those children who were randomised before the withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm from the trial. For sensitivity analysis, we analysed 20 children (10 males and 10 females), 10 randomised to each drug, nine with generalised seizures and 11 with partial seizures. We performed this sensitivity analysis for each outcome and observed any change to results and conclusions.</LI>
<LI>Misclassification of seizure type is a recognised problem in epilepsy; whereby, some people with generalised seizures have been mistakenly classed as having partial onset seizures and vice versa. There is clinical evidence that individuals with generalised onset seizures are unlikely to have an 'age of onset' greater than 25 to 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>). Such misclassification impacted upon the results of a review in our series of pair-wise reviews for monotherapy in epilepsy comparing phenytoin with sodium valproate, in which nearly 50% of participants analysed may have had their seizure type misclassified (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>). Given the overlap of studies contributing to this review and the phenytoin versus sodium valproate review, we suspected that misclassification of seizure type could also be likely in this review, so we examined the distribution of age at onset for individuals with generalised seizures.</LI>

<P>To investigate misclassification for each outcome, we reclassified the 65 individuals with generalised seizure types and age at onset greater than 30 into an 'uncertain seizure type' group and re-analysed three subgroups (partial onset, generalised onset, uncertain seizure type).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables and quality of the evidence (GRADE)</HEADING>
<P>For the 2016 update, we have added two 'Summary of findings' tables to the review (outcomes in the tables decided before the update started based on clinical relevance).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> reports the primary outcome of 'time to treatment withdrawal' in the subgroups of participants with partial onset seizures, generalised onset seizures, and overall, adjusted by epilepsy type.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> reports the secondary outcomes of 'time to 12-month remission' and 'time to first seizure' in the subgroups of participants with partial onset seizures, generalised onset seizures, and overall, adjusted by epilepsy type.</P>
<P>We determined the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>), where we downgraded evidence in the presence of high risk of bias in at least one trial, indirectness of the evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results, and high probability of publication bias. We downgraded evidence by one level if the limitation was considered serious and two levels if considered very serious, as judged by the review authors. Under the GRADE approach, evidence may also be upgraded if a large treatment effect is demonstrated with no obvious biases or if a dose-response effect exists.</P>

<P>We did not obtain individual participant data (IPD) for six trials, with a total of 317 participants, as suitable seizure data for the outcomes examined in this review were not recorded (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1987</LINK>), the trial authors no longer had a copy of the data (<LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>), or trial authors did not respond to our data requests (<LINK REF="STD-Bidabadi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bidabadi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cossu-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cossu 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>). A further trial, which randomised 302 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>), provided access to an IPD dataset, but this was not the final dataset used for the analysis published by the original authors. The pharmaceutical company that sponsored the trial, Ciba-Geigy, who at that time held the product license for carbamazepine, held the final dataset. Since the trial was undertaken, there have been a number of mergers and restructures within the industry, and the current owners of the data are Novartis. Unfortunately, Novartis were unable to locate the data for this trial. The dataset that we had for this trial contained a number of problems and inconsistencies, and we therefore decided not to include this trial in the meta-analysis. None of these seven trials reported the specific time-to-event outcomes chosen for this review, and we could not extract sufficient aggregate data from the trial publications in any other trial. Therefore, we could not include them in data synthesis. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> contains full details of outcomes considered and summaries of results in each eligible trial for which IPD were not available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Trials for which we received individual participant data (IPD)</HEADING>
<P>Three trials reported adequate methods of randomisation and allocation concealment and we judged all three to be at low risk of bias: two trials used permuted blocks to generate a random list and concealed allocation by using sealed opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>); and one trial used number tables to generate a random list and concealed allocation by allocating the randomised drug on a different site to where participants were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>). One trial reported only that participants were randomised with stratification for seizure type (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>); no further information was provided in the study publication or from the authors regarding the methods of generation of the random list and concealment of allocation and we judged this study at unclear risk of bias. For two trials, neither the study publication nor the authors provided the method of generation of the random list; one trial reported that allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes prepared on a different site to recruitment of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>), and the other trial reported that allocation was concealed by sealed opaque envelopes, but this method was not used for all participants in the trial; we judged this trial to be at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>). This inadequate allocation concealment may have resulted in selection bias in this trial, so we performed sensitivity analyses for all outcomes excluding participants from this trial (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK> and <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>).</P>

<P>One trial double-blinded participants and personnel using an additional blank tablet (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>); however, it was unclear if this trial blinded the outcome assessor. One trial blinded participants and the outcome assessors who performed cognitive testing but did not blind a research assistant recruiting participants and providing counselling on medication adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>). Similarly, another trial blinded participants and a psychologist and therapist throughout the trial, while not blinding the treating physician for practical and ethical reasons (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>). We judged that the open-label elements of these two studies were unlikely to have influenced the results of these trials. However, the latter trial blinded a researcher throughout the trial duration, but unblinded the researcher for analysis, which may have impacted upon results. One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, did not report any information on blinding in the study publication, and no information was available from the study authors. Two trials were unblinded for "practical and ethical reasons" (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>); however, it is likely that the unblinded design of <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> contributed to the early withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm, which is likely to have had an effect on the overall results of the trial. Further, as the two trials were conducted under the same protocol, the open design may have also contributed to the withdrawal rates in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> and influenced the overall results; we judged both trials at high risk of performance and detection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Trials for which we received IPD</HEADING>
<P>In theory, a review using IPD should overcome issues of reporting biases as unpublished data can be provided and unpublished outcomes calculated. We received sufficient IPD to calculate the four outcomes ('time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', 'time to six-month remission, 'time to 12-month remission', and 'time to first seizure') for four of the six trials (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>). The study duration of <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> was 12 weeks, and all randomised participants completed the study without withdrawing; therefore, we could only calculate 'time to first seizure' for this trial. <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> did not record the dates of all seizures after randomisation and dates of withdrawal for allocated treatment for all participants; therefore, we could only calculate 'time to first seizure' for this trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Trials for which no IPD were available</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported either cognitive outcomes, seizure outcomes, adverse events, or a combination of these (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1987</LINK>). One trial reported cognitive outcomes only, but no adverse events or seizure outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Cossu-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cossu 1984</LINK>); however, as no protocols were available for the aforementioned three trials, we do not know whether either seizure outcomes, recording of adverse events, or both, were planned a priori.

<P>For this outcome, a HR greater than one indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine.</P>
<P>Times to withdrawal of allocated treatment and reasons for withdrawal were available for 676 participants from four of the six trials providing IPD (97.8% of 691 participants from <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) and 46.4% of the total 1455 participants from the 13 included studies). <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> did not record follow-up data for one participant randomised to carbamazepine. <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> did not record the randomised drug for six participants, and the reason for withdrawal was not available for one participant randomised to carbamazepine and could not be determined from the case notes. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, for one participant randomised to carbamazepine and three participants randomised to phenobarbitone and in <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, for one participant randomised to carbamazepine and two participants randomised to phenobarbitone, the reason for withdrawal was not available and could not be determined from the case notes. We did not include these 15 participants with missing outcome data in the analysis of 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'. All participants completed the 12-week study in <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> and so could not contribute to the analysis of 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'. From the IPD provided by <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, we were able to establish reasons for treatment withdrawal for all participants, but the date of withdrawal of allocated treatment was not available for all participants (see <LINK TAG="DATA_EXTRACTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data extraction and management</LINK> for further details); therefore, we could not calculate the 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' for this study.</P>
<P>Among the 784 participants for which we had reasons for treatment withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>), 393 participants prematurely withdrew from treatment (50%): 216 out of 415 participants randomised to carbamazepine (52%) and 178 out of 369 participants randomised to phenobarbitone (48%). (See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for reasons for premature termination of the study by treatment and how we classified these withdrawals in analysis). We deemed 235 participants (30%) to have withdrawn for reasons related to the study drug, 125 (30%) on carbamazepine and 110 (30%) on phenobarbitone, and we classed these withdrawals as 'events' in analysis. We classed the other 158 withdrawals to be not related to the study drug and censored these participants in analysis, in addition to those who completed the study without withdrawing.</P>
<P>The overall pooled HR (for 676 participants) was 1.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.94, P = 0.003, from fixed-effect analysis), indicating a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine; in other words, participants withdrew significantly earlier from phenobarbitone than carbamazepine in the four included trials. There was moderate statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 7.07, df = 3, P = 0.07, I² statistic = 58%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). When we repeated the analysis using random-effects, the pooled HR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.95 to 2.38, P = 0.07), still indicating an advantage for carbamazepine, but this advantage was no longer statistically significant.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis excluding participants from <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> from analysis because of high risk of selection bias due to inadequate allocation concealment (see <LINK TAG="ALLOCATION" TYPE="SECTION">Allocation (selection bias)</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). This sensitivity analysis resulted in a larger advantage for carbamazepine with a pooled HR of 1.66 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.20, P = 0.0005, calculated with fixed-effect) and reduced heterogeneity (Chi² test = 3.24, df = 2, P = 0.20, I² statistic = 35%) but no change to conclusions. Further, in <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, we also found inconsistencies (between IPD dataset and published results) in the number of participants who withdrew from allocated treatment for certain reasons, which the trial authors could not resolve. These inconsistencies were as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Results from the IPD dataset: 51 participants withdrew, 31 from carbamazepine and 20 from phenobarbitone: 16 participants left the area (lost to follow-up), 10 withdrew due to adverse effects, 22 withdrew for personal reasons or no stated reason (classed as an event), and three died (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Results in the trial report: 53 participants withdrew, 31 from carbamazepine and 22 from phenobarbitone: 18 participants left the area (lost to follow-up), five withdrew because of adverse effects, three died, and 27 withdrew for personal reasons or no stated reason.</LI>
</UL>
<P>As the overall number of events and censored observations was similar (results from the IPD dataset: 51 withdrew, 32 events, 19 censored; and results in the trial report: 53 withdrew, 32 events, 21 censored) and as our sensitivity analysis excluding results of <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> gave similar results and an unchanged conclusion, we feel that these inconsistencies are minor and are unlikely to have had a large impact on the overall results. In the primary analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, we classed those who withdrew for 'no clearly articulated reason' as events in the analysis; in other words, the withdrawal was due to the study drug. However, it is also possible that these participants may have withdrawn for reasons not related to the study drug, and we therefore should have censored them in the analysis. We performed a further sensitivity analysis censoring the 19 participants who withdrew for 'no clearly articulated reason'. Again, the results of the sensitivity analysis were similar to the primary analysis, showing a slightly larger statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine (pooled HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.17, P = 0.0003), and again, heterogeneity was substantially reduced after censoring these participants (Chi² test = 3.25, df = 3, P = 0.35, I² statistic = 8%).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (primary analysis with events and censored observations as summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), there was some evidence that the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model may have been violated; the P value of the time-varying covariate was 0.084. In sensitivity analysis under our alternative assumption regarding censoring (we censored participants who withdrew for 'no clearly articulated reason' rather than analyse them as events), there was no evidence that the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was violated; the P value of the time-varying covariate was 0.824. We therefore assume that the non-proportionality of <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> in our primary analysis was likely to be due to our assumptions regarding censoring of participants. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was satisfied for all other trials included in analysis.</P>
<P>For participants with generalised onset seizures (136), the pooled HR was 1.53 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.88, P = 0.19; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 0.49, df = 2, P = 0.78, I² statistic = 0%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For participants with partial onset seizures (520), the pooled HR was 1.49 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.00, P = 0.007; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), indicating a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine, but a large amount of statistical heterogeneity was present between trials (Chi² test = 8.74, df = 3, P = 0.03, I² statistic = 66%). When we repeated the analysis using random-effects, the pooled HR for participants with partial onset seizures was 1.58 (95% CI 0.82 to 3.06, P = 0.17), still indicating an advantage for carbamazepine, but this advantage was no longer statistically significant.</P>
<P>Overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type) was 1.50 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.95, P = 0.003, from fixed-effect analysis; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), providing evidence of a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine. When we repeated the analysis using random-effects (Chi² test = 9.24, df = 6, P = 0.16, I² statistic = 35%), the pooled HR was 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.28, P = 0.04). In this case, the advantage of carbamazepine was still statistically significant. We found no interaction between treatment and seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) (Chi² test = 0.00, df = 1, P = 0.95, I² statistic = 0%).</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis including only the 20 participants randomised in <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> before the withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm gave similar results with a pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type for 633 participants) of 1.42 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.86, P = 0.01) and heterogeneity between trials was reduced to 0 in this analysis (Chi² test = 5.66, df = 3, P = 0.14, I² statistic = 0%). Results within each seizure group were also similar in this sensitivity analysis, with a pooled HR (for 115 participants with generalised seizures) of 1.37 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.73, P = 0.37, I² statistic = 0%) and a pooled HR of 1.43 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.92, P = 0.02, I² statistic = 46%) for 498 participants with partial seizures (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for further details).</P>
<P>Following reclassification of the 65 participants aged 30 or older with new onset generalised seizures in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>), results were very similar and conclusions were unchanged (results available from review authors).</P>
<P>Inadequate allocation concealment in <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> may have influenced withdrawal rates if participants, or personnel, or both, were aware of which drug the participants had been assigned; from the data we received, 19% of participants withdrew from the carbamazepine arm, and 15% of participants withdrew from the phenobarbitone arm while the other three studies included in the analysis showed more participants withdrawing from the phenobarbitone arm than the carbamazepine arm. Furthermore, inconsistencies between published data and data provided to us and unclear definitions for reason of withdrawal (participants withdrew for 'no clearly articulated reason') was likely to have influenced the results of our analysis. These factors in the <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> trial in addition to the continuation of the carbamazepine arm in <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> after the withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm are all factors that are likely to have contributed to the heterogeneity in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>. These factors may have confounded the results of our primary analyses in this review.</P>

The study duration of <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> was 12 weeks, so 12-month remission was not possible among participants in this trial. <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> recorded the date of first seizure after randomisation, but all dates of subsequent seizures were not available; therefore, we could calculate 'time to first seizure' but not 'time to six-month remission' and 'time to 12-month remission'.</P>
<P>Two hundred and eighty out of 683 participants (41%) achieved 12-month remission; 163 out of 384 (45%) on carbamazepine and 117 out of 319 (37%) on phenobarbitone.

There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 3.54, df = 3, P = 0.32, I² statistic = 15%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis excluding participants from <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> from the analysis because of high risk of selection bias due to inadequate allocation concealment (see <LINK TAG="ALLOCATION" TYPE="SECTION">Allocation (selection bias)</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). This sensitivity analysis resulted in a pooled HR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.09, P = 0.17), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. Again, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 0.33, df = 2, P = 0.85, I² statistic = 0%). Our conclusion did not change following the sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, there was evidence that the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model may have been violated; the P value of the time-varying covariate was &lt; 0.001. On closer inspection of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, all 60 participants who achieved 12-month remission achieved immediate remission (i.e. did not have any seizures at all in the first 12 months of follow-up). The trial followed up a further 42 participants for more than 365 days (up to 548 days); however, none of these participants achieved a 12-month period of seizure freedom during the trial, so we censored them all at their last follow-up date (after 365 days). This observation would explain the apparent change in treatment effect over time in <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, and therefore the violation of the proportional hazards assumption. When we analysed separately those who achieved immediate 12-month remission, the proportional hazards assumption was satisfied (P value of time-varying covariate was 0.872). The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was satisfied for all other trials included in the analysis.</P>
<P>For participants with generalised onset seizures (158), the pooled HR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.01, P = 0.05; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), suggesting a borderline statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between studies for participants with generalised seizures (Chi² test = 0.61, df = 2, P = 0.74, I² statistic = 0%). For participants with partial onset seizures (525), the pooled HR was 1.11 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.51, P = 0.52; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> ), suggesting an advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. A considerable amount of statistical heterogeneity was present between studies for participants with partial onset seizures (Chi² test = 9.06, df = 3, P = 0.03, I² statistic = 67%). When we repeated the analysis with random-effects, the result for participants with generalised seizures was unchanged, and for participants with partial onset seizures, the pooled HR was 1.24 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.22, P = 0.47), showing a larger advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. Overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type for 683 participants, fixed-effect) was 0.93 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.20, P = 0.57), suggesting no clear overall advantage for either drug, but a considerable amount of heterogeneity was present between studies (Chi² test = 13.48, df = 6, P = 0.04, I² statistic = 55%). When we repeated the analysis with random-effects, results were similar and conclusions unchanged. We found a statistically significant interaction between treatment and seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) (Chi² test = 3.81, df = 1, P = 0.05, I² statistic = 73.8%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, calculated with fixed-effect).</P>
<P>Upon visual inspection of forest plots in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, it was clear that <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> was the main source of the heterogeneity between studies in the subgroup of participants with partial onset seizures. The other three studies showed moderate, non-significant effect sizes while <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> showed a large, significant effect size in favour of phenobarbitone (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.65). This effect was not shown in the subgroup of participants with generalised onset seizures in participants in <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.18). Repeating our sensitivity analysis from above, excluding <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> from analysis due to inadequate allocation concealment, heterogeneity reduced to 0 (I² statistic = 0%) in all analyses, and there was no longer evidence of an interaction between treatment and seizure type. Results were also changed for participants with generalised onset seizures (101) (pooled HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.19, P = 0.19), showing an advantage for carbamazepine that was no longer statistically significant; for participants with partial onset seizures (394), a pooled HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.25, P = 0.47) showed a change in direction of effect, now indicating an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. And overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type for 495 participants) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.10, P = 0.18), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis excluding participants randomised to carbamazepine following withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm in the <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> trial gave similar results, with an estimated pooled HR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.17, P = 0.42). Results within each seizure group were also similar, with a pooled HR of 0.59 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.95, P = 0.03) for participants with generalised seizures (137) and a pooled HR of 1.09 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.49, P = 0.61) for participants with partial seizures (503), resulting in no changes in conclusions (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for further details).</P>
<P>Following reclassification of the 65 participants aged 30 or older with new onset generalised seizures in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>), results were very similar and conclusions were unchanged (results available from review authors).</P>
<P>As in the analysis of our primary outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> seemed to be contributing the majority of the variability between trial results. This could have been a knock-on effect of the inadequate allocation concealment in this trial, which was likely to have influenced the withdrawal rates in this study, and in turn the number of participants remaining in the trial who could achieve 12-month remission. Again, we conclude that the inclusion of this study may have confounded the results of this outcome.</P>

<I>(3) </I>Time to achieve six-month remission</HEADING>
<P>For this outcome, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for phenobarbitone. See 'time to 12-month remission' for details of participants included in the analyses of time to six-month remission.</P>
<P>Three hundred and eighty-seven out of 683 participants (57%) achieved six-month remission, 213 out of 384 (59%) on carbamazepine and 117 out of 319 (55%) on phenobarbitone. The overall pooled HR (for 683 participants) was 1.02 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.26, P = 0.86), suggesting no advantage for either drug. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 3.63, df = 3, P = 0.30, I² statistic = 17%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis excluding participants from <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> from the analysis because of high risk of selection bias due to inadequate allocation concealment (see <LINK TAG="ALLOCATION" TYPE="SECTION">Allocation (selection bias)</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). This sensitivity analysis resulted in a pooled HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.14, P = 0.34), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. Again, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 0.14, df = 2, P = 0.93, I² statistic = 0%). Our conclusion did not change following the sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, there was an indication that the proportional hazards assumption may have been violated (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>); the P value of the time-varying covariate was 0.054, and visual inspection of the cumulative incidence plot (<LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>) showed crossing of the curves at around 300 days. In other words, up to 300 days, participants on phenobarbitone seemed to be achieving six-month remission earlier than those on carbamazepine, but this changed after 300 days. However, participant numbers were reduced by 300 days (83 participants at risk out of 308 randomised), so small changes may have been magnified at this time.</P>
<P>As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted a piecewise Cox regression model to investigate any change in treatment effect over time, assuming proportional hazards within each interval. From the visual inspection of <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>, we split the follow-up period of <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> into three intervals: 0 to 182.5 days (immediate six-month remission), 182.5 to 300 days, and over 300 days (maximum follow-up: 1616 days). We estimated separate HRs for each interval.</P>
<P>For 'interval 0 to 182.5 days' (74 events from 308 at participants at risk), the HR was 1.06 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.77, P = 0.83), indicating no clear advantage of either drug. For 'interval 182.5 to 300 days' (22 events from 83 participants at risk), the HR was 0.65 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.15, P = 0.14), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. For 'interval over 300 days' (20 events from 41 participants at risk), the HR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.33, P = 0.65), suggesting no clear advantage of either drug.</P>
<P>These results suggest some indication of a change in treatment effect over time, with no clear advantage between the two drugs in the early stages of the trial for immediate remission; an advantage for carbamazepine emerged after the initial six months, which was no longer present by the end of the study. However, the CIs of estimates were wide, particularly for later times in the trial due to small numbers of events and participants and risk, so we do not have statistically significant evidence to support the hypothesis of a change in treatment effect over time for <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>. Thus, we conclude that the observed difference in treatment effect around 180 to 300 days compared with the rest of the study follow-up was likely to be due to chance that more participants on carbamazepine achieved six-month remission than those on phenobarbitone at this time (16 participants on carbamazepine compared with 6 on phenobarbitone in this time interval) while the numbers of participants achieving six-month remission were more comparable at other time points. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was satisfied for all other trials included in the analysis.</P>
<P>For participants with generalised onset seizures (158), the pooled HR was 0.69 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.01, P = 0.06), suggesting a borderline statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between studies for participants with generalised seizures (Chi² test = 1.25, df = 2, P = 0.54, I² statistic = 0%). For participants with partial onset seizures (525), the pooled HR of 1.17 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.50, P = 0.24) suggested an advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. A considerable amount of statistical heterogeneity was present between studies for participants with partial onset seizures (Chi² test = 7.99, df = 3, P = 0.05, I² statistic = 62%). When we repeated the analysis with random-effects, the result for participants with generalised seizures was unchanged, and for participants with partial onset seizures, the pooled HR of 1.15 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.82, P = 0.54) still showed an advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. Overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type for 683 participants, fixed-effect) was 0.99 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.23, P = 0.95), suggesting no clear overall advantage for either drug, but a considerable amount of heterogeneity was present between studies (Chi² test = 14.24, df = 6, P = 0.03, I² statistic = 58%). When we repeated the analysis with random-effects, results were similar and conclusions unchanged. We found a statistically significant interaction between treatment and seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) (Chi² test = 5.00, df = 1, P = 0.03, I² statistic = 80.0%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, calculated with fixed-effect).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">4) Time to first seizure post-randomisation</HEADING>
<P>For this outcome, a HR greater than one indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine.</P>
<P>We had data for 822 participants from six trials (98.3% of 836 participants from <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>)). <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> did not record the randomised drug for six participants, and dates of seizure recurrence were not available for eight participants (4 randomised to carbamazepine and 4 to phenobarbitone) in <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; therefore, we did not include these 14 participants in the analysis.</P>
<P>Four hundred and fifty-three out of 822 participants (55%) experienced seizure recurrence, 264 out of 434 (61%) on carbamazepine and 189 out of 388 (49%) on phenobarbitone. The overall pooled HR (for 822 participants) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, P = 0.18; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), suggesting an advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 6.26, df = 5, P = 0.28, I² statistic = 20%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis excluding participants from <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> from analysis because of high risk of selection bias due to inadequate allocation concealment (see <LINK TAG="ALLOCATION" TYPE="SECTION">Allocation (selection bias)</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). This sensitivity analysis resulted in a pooled HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.08, P = 0.22), still suggesting an advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. Again, there was no significant evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 6.04, df = 4, P = 0.20, I² statistic = 34%). Our conclusion did not change following the sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, we found inconsistencies (between the IPD dataset and published results), which the study authors could not resolve; the publication reported that only seven participants had experienced no seizures from the start of treatment (3 randomised to phenobarbitone and 4 randomised to carbamazepine); however, from IPD provided, 21 participants did not experience seizures from the start of treatment (12 randomised to phenobarbitone and 9 randomised to carbamazepine). Given these inconsistencies and the limited data available on seizure recurrence, we performed sensitivity analysis excluding the participants from <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> from <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>. This sensitivity analysis resulted in a pooled HR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.01, P = 0.06), suggesting a slightly larger advantage to phenobarbitone, which is now borderline statistically significant. Again, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi² test = 5.11, df = 4, P = 0.28, I² statistic = 22%). This sensitivity analysis showed that <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, a trial which showed a small, non-significant advantage for carbamazepine, may have confounded the results of our analysis; without the inclusion of this trial, our results indicated a larger, borderline statistically significant advantage for phenobarbitone for the outcome of time to first seizure.</P>
<P>For participants with generalised onset seizures (238), the pooled HR was 1.23 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.77, P = 0.27; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. A considerable amount of statistical heterogeneity was present between studies for participants with generalised onset seizures (Chi² test = 8.65, df = 4, P = 0.07, I² statistic = 54%). For participants with partial onset seizures (584), the pooled HR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.96, P = 0.02; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) suggested a statistically significant advantage for phenobarbitone. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between studies for participants with partial onset seizures (Chi² test = 4.55, df = 5, P = 0.47, I² statistic = 0%). When we repeated the analysis with random-effects, the result for participants with partial onset seizures was unchanged, and for participants with generalised onset seizures, the pooled HR of 1.15 (95% CI 0.66 to 2.02, P = 0.62) still showed an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. Overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type for 822 participants, fixed-effect) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, P = 0.18), suggesting an advantage for phenobarbitone that was not statistically significant. A considerable amount of heterogeneity was present between studies (Chi² test = 17.98, df = 10, P = 0.06, I² statistic = 44%). When we repeated the analysis with random-effects, the results were similar and conclusions unchanged. We found a statistically significant interaction between treatment and seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) (Chi² test = 4.78, df = 1, P = 0.03, I² statistic = 79.1%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>, calculated with fixed-effect).</P>
<P>From visual inspection of forest plots in <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>, it was clear that <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> was the main source of the heterogeneity between studies in the subgroup of participants with generalised onset seizures. The other four studies showed non-significant advantages of carbamazepine, while <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> showed a large, significant effect size in favour of phenobarbitone (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.76). The subgroup of participants with partial onset seizures in participants in <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> did not show this effect (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 7.80). Reclassification of the 65 participants aged 30 or older with new onset generalised seizures in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>) into an uncertain seizure type group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) reduced heterogeneity between studies for the remaining 757 participants to 0 (I² statistic = 0%); the results among participants with partial onset seizures were unchanged. For participants with generalised onset seizures (173), a pooled HR of 1.39 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.77, P = 0.13) indicated a larger advantage of carbamazepine that still does not reach statistical significance. (We note that we could not calculate the HR for <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> as following reclassification, only a single participant remained in the phenobarbitone group and did not experience seizure recurrence). Among the group of participants with 'uncertain' seizure type (65), the pooled HR of 1.22 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.51, P = 0.59) suggested an advantage of carbamazepine that was not statistically significant. A considerable amount of heterogeneity was present in the analysis of reclassified participants (Chi² test = 4.78, df = 2, P = 0.09, I² statistic = 58%), which was perhaps unsurprising as this relatively small group was made up of participants with 'uncertain' and likely different seizure types. Following reclassification, a statistically significant interaction between treatment and seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) still existed (Chi² test = 6.64, df = 2, P = 0.04, I² statistic = 69.9%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), indicating an advantage for phenobarbitone for participants with partial onset seizures and an advantage for carbamazepine for participants with generalised onset seizures.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis excluding participants randomised to carbamazepine following withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm in the <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> trial gave similar results, with an estimated pooled HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.06, P = 0.10). Results within each seizure group were also similar, with a pooled HR of 1.20 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.75) for participants with generalised seizures (217) and a pooled HR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.97, P = 0.007) for participants with partial seizures (562) (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for further details).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, there was an indication that the proportional hazards assumption may have been violated (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>); the P value of the time-varying covariate was 0.08, and visual inspection of the cumulative incidence plot (<LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>) showed crossing of the curves at around 100 days. In other words, up to 100 days, more participants on carbamazepine seemed to be experiencing first seizure recurrence earlier than those on phenobarbitone, but this changed after 100 days. However, participant numbers were reduced by 100 days (26 participants at risk out of 64 randomised), so small changes may have been magnified at this time. Furthermore, curves also seemed to cross at around 800 days, when even fewer participants remained at risk of first seizure in the trial (11 participants at risk out of 64 randomised).</P>
<P>As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted a piecewise Cox regression model to investigate any change in treatment effect over time assuming proportional hazards within each interval. From the visual inspection of <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>, we split the follow-up period of <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> into three intervals: 0 to 100 days, 100 to 800 days, and over 800 days (maximum follow-up 4163 days). We estimated separate HRs for each interval.</P>
<P>For 'interval 0 to 100 days' (38 events from 64 participants at risk), the HR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.36 to 2.34, P = 0.83), indicating no clear advantage of either drug. For 'interval 100 to 800 days' (14 events from 26 participants at risk), the HR was 1.06 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.01, P = 0.86), again, suggesting no clear advantage of either drug. Over 800 days, 11 participants remained at risk; however, neither of the two remaining participants randomised to phenobarbitone experienced an event (shown by the flattening of the curve at around 700 to 800 days in <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>); therefore, the HR of first seizure recurrence was undefined over this time period. Furthermore, in sensitivity analysis excluding participants randomised to carbamazepine following withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm in the <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> trial, there was no longer evidence that the proportional hazards assumption had been violated; the P value of the time-varying covariate was 0.316 among these 20 participants.</P>
<P>We did not find any statistically significant evidence to support a change in treatment effect over time in <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> for the outcome of 'time to first seizure'. We conclude that the imbalance in participant numbers in the two randomised groups (54 randomised to carbamazepine and 10 randomised to phenobarbitone) magnified the apparent crossing of the survival plots over time and the majority of participants experiencing an event (60 participants experienced a seizure while only four were censored in this analysis) was also likely to be an influence. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was satisfied for all other trials included in the analysis.</P>
<P>We conclude from this analysis that there was likely to be a difference in efficacy of the drugs (in terms of time to first seizure recurrence after randomisation) by seizure type, that participants with generalised seizures experience seizure recurrence later on carbamazepine than phenobarbitone, and that participants with partial onset seizures experience seizure recurrence later on phenobarbitone than carbamazepine. The overall trend towards an advantage for phenobarbitone for all included participants reflects that the majority of participants included in this analysis had partial onset seizures (71% of 822 included participants). It was possible that inconsistencies in data provided to us (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>), and misclassification of seizure type in participants over the age of 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>), may have confounded the results of this analysis. However, in a sensitivity analysis to take account of these confounding factors, the association between treatment and seizure type still existed and therefore could be a true association.</P>

<P>It was difficult to summarise the 'most common' adverse events overall across the 12 studies or deduce whether carbamazepine or phenobarbitone were most associated with specific adverse events because of the differences in methods of reporting adverse event data across the studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). We did not include requests for adverse event data for individuals in the original IPD requests for earlier versions of this review, but we will pledge to do this in all future IPD requests.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review provide statistically significant evidence of an advantage for carbamazepine over phenobarbitone (phenobarbitone) for our primary global effectiveness outcome 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', when accounting for partial onset and generalised onset seizure types of 676 participants (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.95, P = 0.003). However, a substantial amount of heterogeneity was present between individual results of the four included studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>), and when we accounted for this heterogeneity in random-effects analysis, the advantage for carbamazepine was less convincing (pooled HR was 1.53, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.28, P = 0.04). We found no evidence of a difference between the two seizure types included in this review with respect to our primary outcome.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome showed that poor methodological aspects of a single trial, <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>, recruiting 192 participants (13% of total eligible participants from 13 trials), contributed much variability to this analysis. This study did not adequately conceal allocation to participants, or personnel, or both, which may have influenced withdrawal rates in the study. Furthermore, there were inconsistencies between reasons for withdrawal of allocated treatment in the participant data provided to us and those reported in the published paper, in addition to unclear reasons for withdrawal, which are likely to have introduced variability into the analysis. Also, the withdrawal of the phenobarbitone arm within an included paediatric study, <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, because of concerns of serious behavioural adverse events, was likely to have introduced variability and bias into the results of our primary outcome (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK>); therefore, we encourage caution when interpreting the results of our primary outcome.</P>
<P>For our two remission outcomes ('time to 12-month and six-month remission'), we did not find any statistically significant differences between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone overall or by seizure type. Again, a substantial amount of variability was present between studies, mostly contributed by <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>. We believe that it was likely that the inadequate allocation concealment in this trial also influenced the remission outcomes (i.e. the withdrawal rates in this study influenced by inadequate allocation concealment in turn influence the number of participants remaining in the trial who could achieve six- or 12-month remission).</P>
<P>In the analysis of our other secondary efficacy outcome 'time to first seizure', among 822 participants in six included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>), we found evidence of an advantage of phenobarbitone that did not reach statistical significance (pooled HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, P = 0.18). For this outcome, we did find a statistically significant difference in outcome by seizure type (P value for Chi² test of subgroup differences); for 238 participants with generalised onset seizures, the pooled HR of 1.23 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.77, P = 0.27) suggested an advantage for carbamazepine that was not statistically significant, and for 584 participants with partial onset seizures, the pooled HR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.96, P = 0.02) suggested a statistically significant advantage for phenobarbitone. Again, there was variability between individual study results likely to be due to the methodological aspects of <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK> discussed above, inconsistencies between data provided and published data in <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, and potential misclassification of seizure type, particularly evident in <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>. However, following sensitivity analyses to account for these potential sources of variability, the association between outcome and seizure type remained statistically significant; therefore, we conclude that participants with generalised seizures experience seizure recurrence later on carbamazepine than phenobarbitone and that participants with partial onset seizures experience seizure recurrence later on phenobarbitone than carbamazepine. We also conclude that the overall trend in favour of phenobarbitone for this outcome was likely to reflect the distribution of seizure types of participants included in this analysis (71% of included participants were classified as having partial onset seizures).</P>
<P>The direction of the association between seizure type and outcome (advantage for carbamazepine for generalised seizures and advantage for phenobarbitone for partial seizures) was unexpected given documented evidence that carbamazepine may exacerbate some generalised seizure types, such as myoclonic and absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>), and that current guidelines recommend carbamazepine as a first-line drug for the treatment of partial seizures (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>For all outcomes in this review, we would encourage caution over the interpretation of the results because of concerns regarding <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK> (see below), and we would not advocate basing a choice between these two drugs on the results of this review alone.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:32:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe our systematic electronic searches identified all relevant evidence for this review. We have gratefully received IPDfor 1138 individuals (78% of individuals from all eligible trials) from the authors of seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>), which included a comparison of phenobarbitone with carbamazepine for the treatment of epilepsy. However, we were not able to include the data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>), recruiting 302 participants (representing 21% of the total number in the 13 eligible trials and 27% of the total number of participants from the trials for which we received IPD), because of many inconsistencies in the dataset that could not be resolved and we felt were too extensive to account for in sensitivity analysis (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>We could not include in any analysis 317 individuals (22%) from the other six relevant trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bidabadi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bidabadi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cossu-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cossu 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1987</LINK>), as IPD were not available and the published reports did not report outcomes of interest. Therefore, in total, we were able to include data for 836 participants from six trials (57% of individuals from all eligible trials).</P>
<P>However, while we received data for 836 participants for our primary effectiveness analysis, we were not able to include all data in all of our analyses; because of the short three-month duration of the trial, we were unable to include 37 participants from <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> in our remission analysis, and in this short follow-up time, no participants withdrew from treatment; therefore, this study could not contribute to our primary outcome of 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' either. We were also unable to include 108 participants from <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> in analyses of treatment withdrawal and remission as we did not receive dates of treatment withdrawals and subsequent seizures after first seizure recurrence. Therefore, our primary outcome was, in fact, based on 676 participants (47% of individuals from all eligible trials).</P>
<P>Having to exclude data from nearly half of the eligible participants due to lack of IPD and insufficient reporting in study publications was likely to have impacted on the applicability of the evidence; therefore, we encourage caution in the interpretation of all results in this review. However, it was difficult to quantify exactly how large this impact was on the results of this review (see <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials contributing around 80% of the participant data to this review recruited adults only (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>); the other two studies contributing around 20% of data were paediatric trials (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>). Also, the largest single trial contributing over a third of the participant data to this review, <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, recruited individuals with partial onset seizures only. Therefore, only around 30% of participants included in this review were experiencing generalised onset seizures. Furthermore, there is evidence within this review to suggest that up to 27% of individuals with newly onset generalised seizures may have had their seizure type misclassified. For these reasons, the results of this review may not be fully generalisable to children or to individuals with generalised onset seizures, and more evidence recruiting these types of participants is required.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:47:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The six trials for which IPD were made available were generally of quite good methodological quality; however, four out of the six trials for which we received IPD were at high risk of bias for at least one aspect (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), which may have introduced bias into analyses.</P>
<P>Three of the trials contributing 27% of the participant data to this review described adequate methods of randomisation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>); however, the other two largest single trials contributing 50% of participant data to this review did not describe the method of randomisation or allocation concealment used, or both, and this information was not available from study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>). We are uncertain whether this lack of information has impacted on the results of this review. One study contributing 23% of participant data to this review reported that an adequate method of allocation concealment was not used for all randomised participants, and we believe this inadequate allocation concealment may have influenced rates of withdrawal if participants, or clinicians, or both, were aware of the allocated treatment, which may have had a further knock-on effect on our remission outcomes (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of the trials providing IPD blinded participants and outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>); and the other two trials, <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, were designed as pragmatic open-label trials, as masking of treatment would not be "practicable or ethical", would "undermine compliance", and would "introduce bias due to a very large dropout rate" as blinding does not conform to standard clinical practice of increasing drug doses to therapeutic ranges (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, despite this reasoning, withdrawal rates across the double-blind, <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>, and open-label, <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, studies included in 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' were very similar (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for further details); 37% of participants withdrew from <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> (40% randomised to phenobarbitone and 36% randomised to carbamazepine), 36% of participants withdrew from <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> (40% randomised to phenobarbitone and 28% randomised to carbamazepine), and 46% of participants withdrew from <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> (80% from phenobarbitone and 40% from carbamazepine). There was no statistically significant evidence of a difference in withdrawal rates between the double-blind study and the two studies of an open-label design (Chi² test, P = 0.82). It is however, debatable whether double-blind design is the most appropriate for trials of monotherapy in epilepsy of long duration, and whether such a design does have an impact upon the dropout rate, and therefore, the results of the trial. The overall withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK> was greatly influenced by the high withdrawal rate of children randomised to phenobarbitone (80%), which led to the withdrawal of that treatment arm from the four-treatment study because of concerns of serious adverse events. It is difficult to know if preconceptions of phenobarbitone and documented associations of the drug with adverse behavioural effects in children directly led to the withdrawal of the drug and if the same outcome would have occurred if the study had been double-blinded. It is also interesting to note that within the other paediatric study within this review conducted in a rural area of Bangladesh (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>), there were no documented withdrawals of the allocated treatment (carbamazepine or phenobarbitone) due to adverse events, and in fact, in this study, significantly more children withdrew from carbamazepine than phenobarbitone for reasons related to the study drug (11% withdrew from phenobarbitone, 26% withdrew from carbamazepine, Chi² test, P = 0.05, see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Unfortunately, we could not include this study in the analysis of 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' as dates of treatment withdrawal were not available for all participants. Furthermore, a trial comparing phenobarbitone with phenytoin conducted in India, <LINK REF="REF-Pal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pal 1998</LINK>, in which phenobarbitone was concluded to be an "effective and acceptable antiepileptic drug for rural Indian children" did not report concerns regarding adverse events of phenobarbitone in children.</P>
<P>We note the influence of country of recruitment over the methodological design and perhaps the results of the trial; within the USA and Europe where many treatment options are available, phenobarbitone is no longer considered to be a first-line agent in favour of more tolerable first-line agents, such as carbamazepine and lamotrigine (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>), whereas in developing or rural regions where income is limited and newer generation antiepileptic drugs are not readily available or affordable, older and cheaper drugs, such as phenobarbitone, are more likely to be used as comparators.</P>
<P>While an IPD approach to analysis allows us to use unpublished data, therefore, reducing attrition and reporting bias, for two of the studies contributing 36% of participant data, we found inconsistencies between published data and participant data provided to us in terms of withdrawal information and seizure recurrence, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>), which the study authors could not resolve. In both cases, it was likely that the inconsistencies within these studies contributed to the considerable heterogeneity present within the analyses in this review.</P>
<P>Further differences between the studies were in the population recruited (age of participants and seizure types). We discuss these differences in <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>.</P>
<P>Trials for which no IPD were available were generally of poorer quality than those for which we received IPD. A lot of methodological information in these studies was not reported or unclear: two trials presented incomplete outcome data following exclusion of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>); one study used an inadequate cross-over design for investigating monotherapy treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>); two trials were likely to have been underpowered to detect a difference between the drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Cossu-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cossu 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1987</LINK>); one trial may have been underpowered, too; and two trials available only in abstract or summary form, provided only very limited information on trial methodology (<LINK REF="STD-Bidabadi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bidabadi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, because of the documented methodological issues that may have introduced bias into our meta-analyses, we rated the evidence provided in this review as 'low' quality according to GRADE criteria (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) and would not advocate use of the evidence in this review for clinical decision-making between the two drugs.</P>

<P>We were able to include IPD for 836 out of 1455 eligible participants (57%) from six out of 13 studies in this review and conducted all analyses as IPD analyses. Such an approach has many advantages, such as allowing the standardisation of definitions of outcomes across trials, and attrition and reporting biases are reduced as we can perform additional analyses and calculate additional outcomes from unpublished data. For the outcomes we used in this review that are of a time-to-event nature, an IPD approach is considered to be the 'gold standard' approach to analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, despite the advantages of this approach, for reasons out of our control, we were not able to obtain IPD for 619 participants from seven eligible studies, and no aggregate data were available for our outcomes of interest in study publications; therefore, we had to exclude 43% of eligible participants from our analyses, which may have introduced bias into the review.</P>
<P>Given that no statistically significant differences were found between the drugs in terms of proportions of participants seizure-free and proportions of participants withdrawing from allocated treatment in the seven studies for which IPD were not available (where recorded, see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), we do not believe that our conclusions would have changed for the outcomes of this review had the IPD for the seven studies been available. We do however, recommend caution when interpreting results of analyses of this review because of potential retrieval bias from the exclusion of 43% of eligible participants from seven studies in this review.</P>
<P>Furthermore, five out of the seven studies that we were not able to include in meta-analysis were at high risk of bias for at least one methodological aspect (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>); therefore, inclusion of this data may have introduced bias into our results. We also judged four out of the six studies with IPD provided for analysis to be at high risk of bias for at least one methodological element; we addressed these issues in sensitivity analysis and discussed at length for each analysis (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK> and <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have good evidence from previous reviews conducted by the Cochrane Epilepsy Group that misclassification of seizure type is an important issue in epilepsy trials (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>). We believe that the results of the original trials, and hence the results of the outcome 'time to first seizure', are likely to have been confounded by classification bias, particularly the 19 individuals from <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> classified with new onset generalised seizures over the age of 30, and <LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>, contributing a large amount of variability to the analysis of 'time to first seizure'.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> classified generalised and partial onset seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1981</LINK>), rather than the revised ILAE classification in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>), which may have led to misclassification. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> was conducted in Nigeria, a developing country without access to the same facilities as trials conducted in the USA and Europe; therefore, seizure types were classified clinically, and electroencephalographics (EEGs)/magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were not required for diagnosis of epilepsy. Clinical classification may also have contributed to potential misclassification in this study.</P>
<P>Finally, we made some assumptions in the statistical methodology used in this review. Firstly, when we received only follow-up dates and seizure frequencies, we used linear interpolation to estimate seizure times. We are aware that an individual's seizure patterns may be non-linear; therefore, we recommend caution when interpreting the numerical results of the seizure-related outcomes. We also made an assumption that treatment effect for each outcome did not change over time (proportional hazards assumption, see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>). For all four of the outcomes, there was evidence that one of the trials may have violated this assumption. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in treatment effect tended to occur in the later stages of the studies when small participant numbers were being followed up; therefore, small changes in treatment effect would be magnified. However, we are aware that in studies of long duration (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> followed up participants for between 3 and 10 years), the assumption of treatment effect remaining constant over time is unlikely to be appropriate, for example, there is likely to be a difference between participants who achieve immediate remission compared with participants who achieve later remission. Therefore, if more data can be made available to us for updates of this review, we would like to perform statistical analyses that allow for treatment effects to vary over time.</P>

<P>We have found no consistent differences in individual trials between phenobarbitone and carbamazepine with respect to seizure control or seizure type (<LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bidabadi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bidabadi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cossu-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cossu 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feksi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Feksi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placencia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Placencia 1993</LINK>). However, within these trials, confidence intervals around estimates have been wide and equivalence cannot be inferred.</P>
<P>The adverse event profiles of the two drugs, particularly phenobarbitone with relation to behavioural changes in children, are well documented (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK>). Results of this review suggest that phenobarbitone may be more likely to be withdrawn earlier than carbamazepine; however, results across studies were variable and should be interpreted with caution. There was no evidence in this review that participants are more likely to withdraw from phenobarbitone due to adverse events compared with carbamazepine. We found no differences between the two drugs in terms of time to remission of seizures; however, we found evidence of an advantage for phenobarbitone in terms of time to first seizure recurrence for partial onset seizures and an advantage for carbamazepine in terms of time to first seizure recurrence for generalised onset seizures. This result goes against documented evidence that carbamazepine may exacerbate some generalised seizure types (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>), and that carbamazepine should be one of the drugs of first choice for new onset partial seizures (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>To our knowledge, together with previous versions of this review, this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis that compares phenobarbitone and carbamazepine monotherapy for partial onset seizures and generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures. A network meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), comparing all direct and indirect evidence from phenobarbitone, carbamazepine, and other standard and new antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy. Results of this network meta-analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone for 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' for participants with partial onset seizures and a statistically significant advantage for phenobarbitone compared with carbamazepine for 'time to first seizure' for participants with partial onset seizures. No statistically significant differences were found between the drugs for participants with generalised onset seizures. The results of this review generally agree with the results of the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis is currently being updated to include more recently published studies, such as <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; therefore, we will compare the results of this review with the updated network meta-analysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:48:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current UK guidelines recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as first-line treatment for adults and children with new onset partial seizures and sodium valproate for adults and children with new onset generalised seizures (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this review suggest that carbamazepine is likely to be a more effective drug than phenobarbitone in terms of treatment retention (withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events or both). The results of this review also suggest an association between treatment and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence, with an advantage for phenobarbitone for partial onset seizures and an advantage for carbamazepine for generalised onset seizures. However, studies contributing to the analyses were of varying quality with variable results; therefore, we do not advise that results of this review alone should form the basis of a treatment choice for a patient with newly onset seizures. Because of documented evidence of carbamazepine worsening certain generalised seizure types and behavioural-related adverse events associated with phenobarbitone, particularly in children, we emphasise caution and careful clinical follow-up if these drugs are chosen for these specific subgroups of participants. We also recommend caution in the use of these drugs in women of child-bearing potential because of documented teratogenic effects where the risk is estimated to be two to three times that of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:33:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Few consistent differences in efficacy have been found between these two commonly used antiepileptic drugs in individual trials. The methodological quality of studies comparing these two drugs has been variable, producing variable individual study results introducing heterogeneity into the pooled results of this review and therefore making the pooled results difficult to interpret. If there are differences in efficacy and tolerability across heterogeneous populations of individuals such as those studied here, it is likely that these differences are small. It has been argued that future comparative antiepileptic drug trials should be powered to establish equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>), and therefore be capable of detecting what is considered to be the smallest important clinical difference.</P>
<P>This review highlights the need for the design of future antiepileptic drug monotherapy trials that recruit individuals of all ages with specific epilepsy syndromes powered to detect a difference between particular antiepileptic drugs. An approach likely to reflect and inform clinical practice, as well as being statistically powerful, would be to recruit heterogeneous populations for whom epilepsy syndromes have been adequately defined, with testing for interaction between treatment and epilepsy syndrome. In view of potential problems of misclassification, syndromes will have to be well defined, with adequate checking mechanisms to ensure that classifications are accurate and a system to recognise uncertainty surrounding epilepsy syndromes in individuals within trials.</P>
<P>Consideration is also required in the design of a trial regarding whether to blind participants and outcome assessors to treatment allocation. While an open-label design is a more pragmatic and practical approach for large long-term studies, when trials involve drugs with documented adverse event profiles, such as phenobarbitone, masking of treatment may be important to avoid preconceptions of the drug being more likely to be associated with serious adverse events, which the results of this review did not show.</P>
<P>The choice of outcomes at the design stage of a trial and the presentation of the results of outcomes, particularly of a time-to-event nature, require very careful consideration. While the majority of studies of a monotherapy design record an outcome measuring efficacy (seizure control) and an outcome measuring tolerability (adverse events), there is little uniformity between the definition of the outcomes and the reporting of the summary statistics related to the outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013a</LINK>), making an aggregate data approach to meta-analysis in reviews of monotherapy studies impossible. Where trial authors cannot or will not make IPD available for analysis, we are left with no choice but to exclude a proportion of relevant evidence from the review, which will impact upon the interpretation of results of the review and applicability of the evidence and conclusions. The International League Against Epilepsy recommends that studies of a monotherapy design should adopt a primary effectiveness outcome of 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time)' and should be of a duration of at least 48 weeks to allow for assessment of longer-term outcomes, such as remission (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ILAE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 2006</LINK>). If studies followed these recommendations, an aggregate data approach to meta-analysis may be feasible, reducing the resources and time required from an IPD approach.</P>
<P>A network meta-analysis has also been published (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), comparing all direct and indirect evidence from phenobarbitone, carbamazepine, and other standard and new antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy. This review and the network meta-analysis will be updated as more information becomes available; however, we acknowledge that as phenobarbitone is no longer considered to be a first-line agent for newly diagnosed individuals, in favour of newer agents, such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam, it is unlikely that a substantial amount of new evidence will become available for this review.</P>

<P>We received IPD for all randomised participants. We received reasons for withdrawal of allocated treatment as well as the date of the last follow-up visit, but withdrawal of allocated treatment did not always coincide with the date of the last follow-up visit (i.e. several participants had the allocated treatment substituted for the other trial drug and continued to be followed up). Dates of withdrawal of allocated treatment could not be provided; therefore, we could not calculate 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'. We received the date of first seizure after randomisation, but dates of other seizures in the follow-up time could not be provided; therefore, we calculated 'time to first seizure' for all participants, but we could not calculate the time to six- and 12-month remission.</P>

<P>CBZ: carbamazepine<BR/>PB: phenobarbitone<BR/>¹The date of withdrawal of allocated treatment was not recorded in all cases for <LINK REF="STD-Banu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Banu 2007</LINK>, so we could not calculate 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'. The date of first seizure after randomisation was recorded, but all dates of subsequent seizures were not recorded; therefore, we could calculate 'time to first seizure', but we could not calculate 'time to six-month remission' and 'time to 12-month remission'.<BR/>²We received IPD for 70 participants recruited in <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; the randomised drug was not recorded in six participants.

<P>CBZ: carbamazepine; PB: phenobarbitone<BR/>¹We recorded adverse event data as reported narratively in the publications; therefore, exact definition of a symptom may vary.
