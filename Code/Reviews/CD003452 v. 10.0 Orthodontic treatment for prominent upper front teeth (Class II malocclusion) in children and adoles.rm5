The review looks at whether this treatment is best initiated at seven to 11 years old (early treatment in two phases), or in adolescence, at around age 12 to 16 years (late treatment in one phase). The use of different types of braces was also assessed.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>Prominent (or sticking out) upper front teeth are a common problem in children around the world. For example, this condition affects about a quarter of 12-year-old children in the UK. The correction of this condition is one of the most common treatments performed by orthodontists (dentists who specialise in the growth, function and position of teeth and jaws). This condition develops when the child's permanent teeth erupt. Children are often referred to an orthodontist, for treatment with dental braces, to reduce the prominence of the teeth. Prominent upper front teeth are more likely to be injured and their appearance can cause significant distress.</P><P>If a child is referred at a young age, the orthodontist is faced with the dilemma of whether to treat the patient early or to wait until the child is older and provide treatment in adolescence.</P><P>In 'early treatment', treatment is given in two phases: first at an early age (seven to 11 years old) and again in adolescence (around 12 to 16 years old). In 'late treatment' (one phase), there is only one course of treatment in adolescence.</P><P>As well as the timing of treatment, this review also looked at the different types of braces used: removable, fixed, functional, or head-braces.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>This review is based on 27 studies including 1251 participants. Participants were children and adolescents aged under 16 years who had prominent upper front teeth (Class II Division 1 malocclusion). The evidence in this review is up to date as of 27 September 2017.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>The evidence suggests that providing orthodontic early treatment to children with prominent upper front teeth reduces the incidence of damage to upper incisor teeth significantly (middle four teeth at the top) as compared to treatment that is provided in one phase in adolescence. There are no other advantages of providing a two-phase treatment (i.e. between age seven to 11 years and again in adolescence) compared to treatment in one phase in adolescence.</P><P>The evidence also suggests that providing treatment with functional appliances for adolescents with prominent upper front teeth, significantly reduces their prominence when compared to adolescents who did not receive any treatment. The studies did not suggest that any particular appliance was better than any other for reducing teeth prominence.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The overall quality of the evidence is low for most comparisons and outcomes, therefore further research is needed and may change the findings.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-09 20:39:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-09 20:35:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Prominent upper front teeth are a common problem affecting about a quarter of 12-year-old children in the UK.

It also involves treatment of the teeth and jaws when they are irregular or bite in an abnormal way or both. There are many reasons why the teeth may not bite together correctly. These include the position of the teeth, jaws, lips, tongue, or cheeks; or may be due to heredity, a habit or the way people breathe. The need for orthodontic treatment can be decided by looking at the effect any particular tooth position has on the life expectancy of the teeth, or the effect that the appearance of the teeth has on how people feel about themselves, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1991</LINK>).</P><P>Prominent upper front teeth (Class II malocclusion) may be due to any combination of the jaw, tooth and lip position. The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far forward or, more usually, the lower jaw (mandible) is too far back. The upper front teeth (incisors) may stick out if the lower lip catches behind them or due to a habit (e.g. thumb sucking). This gives the patient an appearance that may be a target for teasing (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1980</LINK>) and bullying (<LINK REF="REF-Seehra-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seehra 2011</LINK>), which impacts on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Johal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johal 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2016</LINK>). When front teeth stick out (more than 3 mm to 5 mm), they are two to three times more likely to be injured (<LINK REF="REF-Frujeri-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frujeri 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 1999</LINK>). Prominent upper front teeth (Class II malocclusion) is one of the most common problems seen by orthodontists and affects about a quarter of 12-year-old children in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1992</LINK>). However, there are racial differences: prominent upper front teeth (Class II malocclusion) are most common in whites of Northern European origin and least common in black and oriental races and some Scandinavian populations (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Mangoury-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Mangoury 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proffit-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proffit 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2001</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-18 08:56:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several dental brace (orthodontic) treatments have been suggested to correct prominent upper front teeth (Class II malocclusions). Some treatments aim to move the upper front teeth backwards (with or without the extraction of teeth) whilst others aim to modify the growth of the upper or lower jaw or both to reduce the prominence of the upper front teeth. Treatment can involve the use of one or more types of orthodontic brace.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-20 10:31:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Some braces apply a force directly to the teeth and can either be removed from the mouth or fixed to the teeth, with special glue, during treatment. Other types of brace are attached, via the teeth, to devices (headgear) that allow a force to be applied to the teeth and jaws from the back of the head. Treatment is usually carried out either early (early treatment), when a mixture of baby and adult teeth are present (around seven to 11 years of age) or later (adolescent treatment) when all the adult teeth have come into the mouth (around 12 to 16 years of age). In severe cases and some adults, orthodontic treatment may need to be combined with jaw surgery to correct the position of one or both jaws.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-20 10:32:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Cochrane Oral Health undertook an extensive prioritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles that were the most clinically important ones to maintain in the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2015</LINK>). This review was identified as a priority title by the orthodontic expert panel (<A HREF="http://ohg.cochrane.org/priority-reviews">Cochrane OHG priority review portfolio</A>).<BR/></P><P>The correction of prominent upper front teeth is one of the most common treatments performed by orthodontists. Even though we have several brace types to correct prominent upper front teeth, new braces are being introduced in the market to overcome the drawbacks of previous ones and there is a need to establish the relative effectiveness of the different braces that can be used.

However, while these changes or differences at the end of phase one were statistically significant, the quality of evidence for this comparison is low.</P><P>When we considered the final outcome of treatment at the end of a second phase of treatment in adolescence, we found that the treatment was effective, in that incisor prominence had been reduced. There were no differences in treatment outcome between the group who had received treatment at a younger age or treatment in adolescence for any variable other than the incidence of new incisal trauma.

Additionally, the quality of the evidence was low for both.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-12-21 09:44:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>One important finding from this review was that while we identified 27 RCTs, they had been published in 63 different papers. Furthermore, several of the investigators had not only reported outcomes at the end of early treatment, but they had produced several papers that were confined to analysis of subsets of participants, to form interim reports or 'updates'. While they may have had good reasons to follow this publication strategy, in terms of having to compete for the renewal of grant funding, this did result in difficulty interpreting the results of these studies. We approached this problem by identifying the most relevant outcomes and data points and then produced composite data extraction for these studies. We would like to suggest that studies are not reported until they are completed. The registration of trials will go some way to addressing some of these issues, where each trial has a unique identity number that will appear on all publications.</P><P>In this review we have analysed data at the end of phase one and phase two in studies that evaluated the effect of early treatment. This is because these trials were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatment provided when the children were 7 to 11 years old. These studies were then extended to the completion of all orthodontic treatment and included in this review. It could be suggested that we should only report the final findings of these trials. However, we feel that the 'early' treatment studies should be included to illustrate that there were some short-term benefits: for example, reduction in overjet and possible increase in self-esteem. Nevertheless, these findings do not detract from the overall conclusions that early treatment is of limited benefit.</P><P>Finally, there was great variation in the outcome measures that were adopted by the investigators. This was particularly marked with the use of cephalometric analyses and is not surprising when we consider that there are many different types of analysis. We would suggest that uniformly applied cephalometric analyses are used when future studies are planned, so that adequate comparisons between trials can be achieved.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-12-22 17:04:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We found 27 RCTs evaluating orthodontic treatment of people with prominent upper front teeth (Class II malocclusion).

It is important to mention that carrying out a trial of a two-phase study (treatment for young children followed by treatment in adolescence) is much more difficult and potentially more prone to bias than a one-phase study. However, in this review, the two-phase studies were of better quality than most of the one-phase studies.</P><P>It is important to point out that one study did not report a complete data set. Although six different articles were published, none of them included a complete data set and did not give reasons for not doing so (<LINK REF="STD-Ghafari-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ghafari 1998</LINK>).</P><P>It is interesting to note that one study was prematurely stopped due to harms (<LINK REF="STD-Thiruvenkatachari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thiruvenkatachari 2010</LINK>). The study compared the Twin Block and the Dynamax appliances and showed a statistically significant overjet reduction in the Twin Block group at the end of the first interim analysis.

Some studies were difficult to categorise as they had recruited participants between 9 and 12 years of age (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> section).
