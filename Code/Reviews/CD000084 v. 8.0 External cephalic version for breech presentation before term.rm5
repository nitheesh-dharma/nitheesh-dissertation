<P>The protocol for the review 'External cephalic version for breech presentation before term' has been updated in order to distinguish between those studies that attempt external cephalic version (ECV) only before term and those that include ECV before term and at term. This distinction has not been made previously. The following comparisons are now included in the review:<BR/>(1) ECV before term compared to no ECV;<BR/>(2) ECV commenced before term and continued up until delivery compared to no ECV;<BR/>(3) ECV commenced before term and continued up until delivery compared with beginning ECV after 37 weeks' gestation.<BR/>
<BR/>We conducted a new search in April 2005, as a result of which we identified one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hutton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 2003</LINK>) and one new ongoing study (Hutton 2004).

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-04 20:41:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Babies born bottom first (in the breech position) may have more problems during birth than those who are born head first (in the cephalic position) because there may be some delay in birth of the head and pressure on the umbilical cord as the head passes through the birth canal. During an external cephalic version (ECV) a breech baby is turned to the head down position by gently pushing on the mother's abdomen. Research shows that ECV after 37 weeks reduces the number of babies in the breech position at full term, and the number of caesarean sections.</P>
<P>This review included five randomised controlled studies with an overall total of 2187 women, the studies were at low or unclear risk of bias although it was not possible to "blind" women and staff to this intervention. Results showed that if ECV is done near the middle of the third trimester (32 to 34 weeks), it increases the chances that the baby will be lying head down at full term. Three trials including 1888 women found that beginning ECV at between 34 and 36 weeks compared with beginning ECV after 37 weeks (at term) had a 19% decrease in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth, a 10% reduction in the risk of failing to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth, and a considerably reduced chance of a breech vaginal delivery, however, early ECV may significantly increase the chances of late preterm birth. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was graded as high. The evidence on the possible advantages and disadvantages of early (before 37 weeks) external cephalic version (ECV) will require careful discussion with women about the timing of the ECV procedure so that they can make informed decisions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>External cephalic version (ECV) of the breech fetus at term (after 37 weeks) has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but the rates of success are relatively low.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-04 20:41:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Five studies are included (2187 women). It was not possible for the intervention to be blinded, and it is not clear what impact lack of blinding would have on the outcomes reported. For other 'Risk of bias' domains studies were either at low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>One study reported on ECV that was undertaken and completed before 37 weeks' gestation compared with no ECV. No difference was found in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.69; participants = 102). One study reported on a policy of ECV that was initiated before term (33 weeks) and up until 40 weeks' gestation and which could be repeated up until delivery compared with no ECV. This study showed a decrease in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.77; participants = 179).</P>
<P>Three studies reported on ECV started at between 34 to 35 weeks' gestation compared with beginning at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. Pooled results suggested that early ECV reduced the risk of non-cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; participants = 1906; studies = three; I = 0%, evidence graded <I>high quality</I>), failure to achieve vaginal cephalic birth (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; participants = 1888; studies = three; I = 0%, evidence graded <I>high quality</I>), and vaginal breech delivery (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78; participants = 1888; studies = three; I = 0%, evidence graded <I>high quality</I>). The difference between groups for risk of caesarean was not statistically significant (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; participants = 1888; studies = three; I = 0%, evidence graded <I>high quality</I>). There was evidence that risk of preterm labour was increased with early ECV compared with ECV after 37 weeks (6.6% in the ECV group and 4.3% for controls) (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.21; participants = 1888; studies = three; I = 0%, evidence graded <I>high quality</I>). There was no clear difference between groups for low infant Apgar score at five minutes or perinatal death (stillbirth plus neonatal mortality up to seven days) (evidence graded as <I>low quality</I> for both outcomes).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-29 10:18:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared with no ECV attempt, ECV commenced before term reduces non-cephalic presentation at birth. Compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV at between 34 to 35 weeks may have some benefit in terms of decreasing the rate of non-cephalic presentation, and risk of vaginal breech birth. However, early ECV may increase risk of late preterm birth, and it is important that any future research reports infant morbidity outcomes. Results of the review suggest that there is a need for careful discussion with women about the timing of the ECV procedure so that they can make informed decisions.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-21 08:31:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By late pregnancy most babies in singleton pregnancies are positioned with their heads down ready for the birth; babies presenting in the breech position (bottom first) may be at increased risk during vaginal birth as there may be delay in birth of the head and compression of the umbilical cord as the head passes through the bony pelvis. About 3% to 4% of all pregnant women who reach full term will have a fetus presenting by the breech, and breech birth is associated as having a higher risk for the neonate regardless of mode of birth (<LINK REF="REF-Schutte-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schutte 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Breech presentation may be caused by an underlying fetal or maternal abnormality, or may be an apparently chance occurrence, or related to an otherwise benign variant such as cornual placental position. In the latter instances, breech presentation places a healthy fetus and mother at increased risk of a complicated vaginal delivery or caesarean section. It is not surprising that, over the years, the possibility of manipulating the baby from the breech to the cephalic presentation has intrigued obstetric caregivers.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-21 08:32:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During an external cephalic version (ECV) a breech baby is turned to the head down position by gently pushing on the mother's abdomen. ECV before term came into routine obstetric practice on the basis of the self-evident immediate effectiveness of the procedure as well as reassuring results from several non-randomised studies, and in spite of the negative results of the only controlled trial reported prior to 1980 (<LINK REF="STD-Brosset-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Brosset 1956</LINK>). The popularity of ECV before term waned after the mid-1970s, partly because of reports of a substantial perinatal mortality associated with the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley_x002d_Watson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley-Watson 1975</LINK>), and the increasing perception of caesarean section as a safer option than ECV or breech delivery.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-11 11:58:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the singleton fetus in breech presentation, caesarean section has been shown to be safer for the fetus than vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>). Even though many women would prefer a vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geary-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geary 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hildingsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hildingsson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turnbull-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnbull 1999</LINK>), most would choose caesarean section if there is a medical indication, resulting in the majority of fetuses in breech presentation now being born by caesarean. The risks associated with caesarean section are low, but caesarean section is not without maternal risk and, in developed countries, remains the largest contributing factor to the incidence of maternal mortality and morbidity following childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>). Estimates of the incidence of mortality associated with elective caesarean section were nearly tripled compared to vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>), and severe maternal morbidity has been shown to be increased five fold (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). Among breech presenting fetuses, a Cochrane review of planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal delivery for breech pregnancy at term, reported that even though 45% of women in the planned vaginal delivery group were delivered by caesarean section, planned caesarean section was associated with an increase in maternal morbidity (risk ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.61) (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>). In addition to the increase in immediate morbidity following caesarean section, intra-abdominal adhesions may occur after caesarean section resulting in subsequent infertility (<LINK REF="REF-LaSala-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaSala 1987</LINK>). The presence of the uterine scar puts future pregnancies at increased risk of complications such as ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, accreta and abruptio, and uterine rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Dashe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dashe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lydon_x002d_Rochelle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lydon-Rochelle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>). A further deterrent to caesarean section is that the procedure requires the expertise of an obstetrician or other physician with surgical training, and limits the role for low-risk obstetrical care providers such as midwives and family practitioners</P>
<P>A review of strategies to reduce caesarean section rates identified external cephalic version (ECV) as the only clinical intervention with demonstrated Level 1 evidence for reducing primary caesarean section rates overall (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002</LINK>). ECV undertaken at term has been shown to be effective in moderately decreasing the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth and in avoiding caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been hypothesised that compared to waiting until term, beginning the ECV procedure somewhat earlier in pregnancy before the breech is engaged in the pelvis and while there are maximal levels of amniotic fluid present may further decrease the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth and promote cephalic vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2011b</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-11 12:01:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prior to the mid-1970s, ECV was usually attempted before term because of the belief that the procedure would seldom be successful at term. Subsequent studies showed that with the use of tocolysis, ECV could be achieved in a substantial proportion of women with breech presentation at term (<LINK REF="REF-Cluver-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluver 2015</LINK>). ECV at term differs in many fundamental ways from that performed before term. These include the fact that the fetus is mature and may be delivered more readily in the event of complications, and that spontaneous version without ECV attempt, or reversion after successful ECV, may be less common at term. A Cochrane review of ECV at term (beginning at 37 weeks) reported an increased likelihood that the fetus will be cephalic at delivery, and reduced caesarean sections (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>). Thus ECV has been recommended for all women with a breech fetus at term, where there is no contraindication. However, the procedure is often unsuccessful, particularly in North American and European settings, (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 1999</LINK>) and in a study comparing outcomes when ECV was begun earlier (34 to 35 weeks' gestation) compared to at term (after 37 weeks' gestation) reported a clinically important decrease in the proportion of women with non-cephalic presentation at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Readers are referred to other reviews of the topic (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1993</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence has been assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) for the comparison ECV commenced before term versus ECV at term. This comparison was considered to be the most clinically relevant, as external cephalic version at term has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the chance of non-cephalic presentation at birth and caesarean section and should be regarded as the standard of care (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>). Comparisons of early ECV with no ECV are now mainly of historical interest. The quality of the evidence was assessed for the following outcomes.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth.</LI>
<LI>Vaginal cephalic birth not achieved (caesarean section plus vaginal breech delivery).</LI>
<LI>Caesarean birth.</LI>

<P>GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials if they were otherwise eligible. In this version of the review no such trials were identified. If cluster trials are eligible for future updates we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population.

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. If we use random-effects analyses in updates, the random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 2003</LINK> is an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (n = 233). All nulliparous women with any breech presentation and multiparous women with a frank breech presentation were eligible for the trial if they had a live singleton fetus and a gestational age of between 34 weeks, 0 days and 36 weeks 0 days. Women were excluded if they had a parity greater than four, if they planned to move to a non-trial centre, or if there was any contraindication to labour or vaginal birth (such as placenta previa, or previous classical caesarean section), to ECV (such as fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placenta, fetal anomalies, uterine anomalies, oligohydramnios, rupture of membranes, over distended uterus) or to early ECV (such as fetus engaged in the pelvis, an increased risk of preterm labour, increased risk of abruptio placenta). ECV was begun between 34 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks 0 days in the early group (n = 117); and between 37 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 0 days in the delayed group (n = 116). Tocolysis was recommended to be used either routinely or selectively in both groups; analgesia was permitted. The primary outcome was presentation at delivery; other outcomes included: caesarean section; serious fetal complication; preterm birth less than 37 weeks; women's views about ECV. The study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Hutton-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 2011</LINK> study included 68 centres in 21 countries with ECV carried out by clinicians who were experienced in the procedure and with birth facilities that were deemed to meet Canadian standards. One-thousand, five-hundred and forty-three women were randomised. The study recruited women with a singleton fetus in a breech presentation, between gestation ages of 33 weeks 0 days and 35 weeks six days. Women with contraindications to ECV (e.g. fetal heart rate abnormalities, placental abruption, major life-threatening fetal anomalies, uterine anomalies, hyper-extended fetal head, rupture of fetal membranes, severe oligohydramnios or hydramnios); contraindications to early ECV (e.g. increased risk of preterm labour or placental abruption); or contraindications to labour or vaginal birth (e.g. placenta praevia, previous classical caesarean section); or if they had been prior participants in the trial; were at increased risk of unstable lie (such as grand multiparity); or if they planned to give birth by caesarean section even if the fetus turned to a cephalic position, or if they planned a vaginal birth if the fetus remained breech were excluded. In the early ECV group (n = 767), ECV carried out between 34 weeks 0 days and 35 weeks six days gestation, and within seven days of randomisation. In the delayed ECV group (n = 774) ECV carried out at or after 37 weeks' gestation. In both groups fetal presentation was confirmed by ultrasound, fetal heart rate was monitored before, during and after the procedure. The use of tocolytics and analgesia was left to the discretion of the clinician, and they were directed to use the same approach for women in both arms of the trial. If the procedure was unsuccessful, or if a fetus reverted to non-cephalic, a repeat ECV procedure could be performed at a later date at the discretion of the care provider in consultation with the woman.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Akhtar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akhtar 2013</LINK> is a single-centre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial carried out in a hospital in Pakistan. The study included women with a singleton fetus with breech presentation between 33 and 35 weeks' gestation (n = 123 women). Women with contraindications to ECV, contraindications to early ECV or contraindications to labour or vaginal birth (e.g. fetal heart rate abnormalities, vaginal bleeding, rupture of membranes, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, previous CS, low amniotic fluid index, fetal weight greater than 4 kg) or women unwilling to undergo ECV were excluded. In the early ECV group, ECV was carried out between 34 (238 days) and 35 weeks of gestation (n = 63). In the delayed ECV group ECV was carried out at or after 37 weeks. No tocolytics were used in either group and women were monitored for three hours before and one hour after the procedure. Up to two-three attempts were allowed. The procedure was discontinued if there was excessive maternal discomfort or fetal heart rate irregularities (n = 60).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-04 20:43:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We have good evidence to support external cephalic version (ECV) beginning at term, that is after 37 weeks' gestation. A Cochrane review of ECV concluded that ECV is a useful manoeuvre to decrease both the rate of non-cephalic presentation and caesarean section when it is begun after 37 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>), and the major obstetrical societies recommend that ECV be offered to low-risk women with singleton breech pregnancies. Of the studies of ECV at term, those undertaken in European or American centres report a relatively low rate of success with ECV and a remarkably higher rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth compared to the African trials. It is possible that there is a difference in the population characteristics. In a cohort study <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1986</LINK> reported higher rates of success with the ECV procedure in a group of African women compared to Caucasian women.</P>
<P>The studies of ECV before term are less straightforward.The <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 1980</LINK> trial which compared ECV prior to term with no ECV, undertook the procedure at an early stage in pregnancy (32 weeks' gestation), when the rates of spontaneous version remain high. Despite the findings from this early study of ECV before term which clearly showed no difference between the ECV and no ECV group, the more recent trials suggest that there may be benefit to beginning ECV prior to, but near term, particularly amongst those populations where success rates at term are low. The <LINK REF="STD-Van-Veelen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Van Veelen 1989</LINK> study beginning ECV as early as 33 weeks (but up to 40 weeks, with a mean of gestational age at ECV of 35 weeks) compared with no ECV showed a 30% decrease in the rate on non-cephalic presentation. This trial showed that women in the ECV group were at reduced risk of failing to achieve cephalic vaginal birth, even though no difference was found in the rate of caesarean section. This is likely due to the higher proportion of women planning a vaginal breech birth when the fetus remained breech at term, as the study was undertaken prior to publication of findings from the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>), and a policy of vaginal breech delivery is evident. The study was too small to meaningfully rule out differences in Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes or in stillbirth or neonatal mortality less than seven days. In the <LINK REF="STD-Van-Veelen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Van Veelen 1989</LINK> study, the mean time of beginning ECV was 35 weeks' gestation, and it is unclear if the benefit that was found could be attributed to beginning the procedure earlier in pregnancy, or because some of the procedures were not initiated until after term.</P>
<P>Three trials compared beginning ECV early at between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation with ECV beginning at between 37 and 38 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Akhtar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akhtar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutton-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 2011</LINK>). Compared with women undergoing ECV at term, women who were randomised to ECV before term had a 19% decrease in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth, a 10% reduction in the risk of failing to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth, a 8% decrease in the caesarean section rate, and a considerably reduced risk of undergoing a vaginal breech birth. The quality of the evidence for all of these outcomes was graded high quality. These findings are clinically important, and except for the finding relating to caesarean section these differences (favouring early ECV) were statistically significant. However, women randomised to early ECV appeared to be at increased risk of late preterm birth (risk increased by 51%), and although, overall, the number of women delivering their babies before term was relatively small (6.6% in the ECV group and 4.3% for controls) the possible increase in late preterm birth needs to be set against the positive outcomes associated with ECV.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-30 14:20:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in the review were of mixed methodological quality. Three of the studies did not provide good descriptions of the methods used (<LINK REF="STD-Akhtar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akhtar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Veelen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Van Veelen 1989</LINK>). Blinding was not possible in these studies and it is difficult to know what impact lack of blinding had on outcomes. While the outcomes measured were objective and may not have been subject to detection bias it is possible that lack of blinding may have affected women's and care providers' behaviour and this may have had an effect on clinical decision-making which could have influenced outcomes such as the decision whether or not to carry out a caesarean section. In two studies trial protocols were available; without this information it is difficult to assess possible outcome reporting bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-04 20:43:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The review process is subject to bias. We attempted to minimise bias by having two review authors independently involved in assessing risk of bias and carrying out data extraction.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-11 09:22:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence on the benefits of early (before 37 weeks) external cephalic version (ECV) will require careful discussion with women to adequately inform decisions around timing of the ECV procedure. While a woman undergoing early ECV is more likely to have cephalic presentation at delivery, have reduced risk of failing to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth and of undergoing a breech vaginal birth, her risk of preterm birth will be increased.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-04 20:43:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Because of the known benefits of ECV, it would now be unethical to recruit women to studies comparing ECV before term with no ECV. Studies comparing early ECV (begun 34 to 35 completed weeks) with ECV begun after 37 weeks have shown that beginning ECV earlier decreases the risk of a non-cephalic presentation at birth, and of failing to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth but increases the risk of having a preterm birth. It is unlikely that additional research will alter these findings substantially and although additional studies may provide more refined estimates of neonatal outcomes, the value of such information may not be needed in light of the findings regarding preterm birth.</P>

<P>The protocol for this review was modified in April 2005 to include comparisons of external cephalic version (ECV) commenced before term but continued if necessary up to term.</P>
<P>In this updated version of the review two additional primary outcomes have been added. The purpose of ECV is to avoid a caesarean birth or a breech vaginal birth; we have therefore added a new composite outcome: cephalic vaginal birth not achieved (caesarean section + breech vaginal birth). The individual outcomes are presented separately; vaginal breech birth is now reported, caesarean section was one of the original outcomes. In this version we have also added an additional secondary outcome: Infant Apgar score &lt; seven at five minutes. Infant morbidity was not consistently reported and low infant Apgar score provides some indication of infant wellbeing at birth. We have now reported more information re neonatal outcome. We also report a non-prespecified outcome: maternal pain scores.</P>
