<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>A Cochrane systematic review comparing systemic antibiotics and topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations, in participants of any age</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is an infection of the middle ear with pus and a persistent perforation in the eardrum. It is a common cause of preventable hearing impairment, particularly in low and middle-income countries. This review compares alternative topical treatments (antibiotics or antiseptics) with systemic (e.g. oral or injected) antibiotics, to identify which is best. Nine randomised controlled trials were included (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears); most were poorly reported and some included a range of diagnoses.</P>
<P>Quinolone antibiotic drops such as ciprofloxacin were better than oral or injected antibiotics at drying the ear. This was found when compared to systemic quinolone or non-quinolone antibiotics. No benefit of adding systemic treatment to topical antibiotics was detected, although evidence was limited. The effects of topical non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) or antiseptics were less clear when compared to systemic treatment. Less is known about longer-term outcomes (producing a dry ear in the long-term, preventing complications, healing the eardrum, and improving hearing), or about treating complicated CSOM. The evidence in these trials about safety is also weak. More research is needed to assess whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than with alternative topical or systemic treatments.</P>

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM). </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965) PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data into RevMan; two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1-2 weeks: relative risks (RR) were, 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 5.49) using systemic non-quinolone antibiotics (2 trials, N = 116), and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) using systemic quinolone (3 trials, N = 175); or 2.75 (1.38 to 5.46) in favour of systemic plus topical quinolone over systemic quinolone alone (2 trials, N = 90). No statistically significant benefit was seen at 2-4 weeks for topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or topical antiseptic over systemic antibiotics (mostly non-quinolones), but numbers were small: one trial tested topical non-quinolones (N = 31); two tested antiseptics (N = 152). No benefit of adding systemic to topical treatment at 1-2 weeks was detected either, although evidence was limited (three trials, N = 204). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. Adverse events reported were generally mild, although hearing worsened by ototoxicity (damaging auditory hair cells) was seen with chloramphenicol drops (non-quinolone antibiotic).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than systemic antibiotics; topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or antiseptic results are less clear. Evidence regarding safety was weak. Further studies should clarify topical non-quinolones and antiseptic effectiveness, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications), and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than other topical or systemic treatments.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:18:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronically discharging ears associated with underlying persistent eardrum perforations (chronic suppurative otitis media, CSOM) are a common cause of preventable hearing impairment worldwide, particularly in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-McPherson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPherson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). CSOM usually occurs in the first five years of life (although it often persists into adulthood), and is related to poor socio-economic conditions. Therefore, while this review aims to address the global perspective of CSOM, much of the information discussed here relates to low-income settings and may differ in developed countries (e.g. age distribution).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>CSOM is one of several types of otitis media (infection of the middle ear). The World Health Organization defines CSOM as "a stage of ear disease in which there is chronic infection of the middle ear cleft, a non-intact tympanic membrane (i.e. perforated eardrum) and discharge (otorrhoea), for at least the preceding two weeks" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), although this could more strictly be considered a childhood definition. Perforations and infection can be in one ear (unilateral) or both (bilateral). A variety of underlying pathologies can cause CSOM including: an acute episode of acute otitis media that has burst the ear drum and not settled within two weeks; a recurrent episode of acute otitis media in an ear with a perforation from a previous episode of acute otitis media; or an ear with a persistent perforation with active chronic otitis media with metaplastic changes to the mucosa of the middle ear and mastoid air cell system (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2003</LINK>, personal correspondence). In adults, the majority of patients are likely to have CSOM with a perforation that will not spontaneously heal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What are the effects of CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>Hearing impairment, aside from the disability from recurrent ear discharge, is the most frequent effect of CSOM. A school survey in Kenya found 63% of ears with CSOM had more than 30 decibels hearing loss, compared to only 3.4% of ears without outer or middle ear pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 1995</LINK>). Hearing impairment due to otorrhoea and a perforated eardrum will usually improve as the disease resolves. However, untreated CSOM may result in permanent hearing loss due to damage to the ossicles which transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the cochlea. Because otitis media occurs mostly in children during pre-school years, the years in which the most dynamic phase of speech and language development occurs, there is concern that the associated hearing deficits may result in speech and language delays or permanent learning disabilities, as well as disturbances in behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to hearing impairment (with its associated consequences), complications of otitis media can often result in death or severe disability, especially in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>), where immunity, housing conditions, and access to medical services are often poorer than in high income settings. The infection may extend and spread to the head and neck structures and to the brain. Intracranial infections include meningitis, abscesses, hydrocephalus, or thrombosis of the lateral venous sinus (from suppuration within the mastoid causing clots occluding the lumen of the vessel) (<LINK REF="REF-Ludman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludman 1997</LINK>). Alternatively complications may be extracranial, such as subperiosteal abscess (superficial accumulations of pus that have broken the bony mastoid cortex), facial paralysis, cholesteatoma (a destructive formation of layers of keratinising epithelium, accumulating in the middle ear and mastoid (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1996</LINK>), also described as 'active squamous (epithelial) chronic otitis media' (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 1997</LINK>)), labyrinthitis (extension to the labyrinth through the round window), or acute mastoiditis (spread of the infection to the mastoid air cells), which may spread further due to necrosis of the bony wall of the cells resulting in further life-threatening complications (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How much of a burden is CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>Around 91% of the burden of otitis media (all types) and nearly all related deaths occur in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 1993</LINK>). Reliable data on prevalence of CSOM are uncommon. One study estimated it at 1.1% in Kenyan schoolchildren (<LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 1995</LINK>) and a review of school and community-based studies reported a prevalence between 0.4% and 6.1% in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1995</LINK>). Data from the World Health Organization and World Bank suggest the global burden of otitis media (of all types) has dropped dramatically since 1990, to approximately 6000 deaths (0.01% of all deaths) and 1,474,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (0.1% of all DALYs) worldwide in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Most of these deaths are likely to be due to chronic otitis media and its complications, because acute otitis media is usually a self-limiting infection (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although most of the background literature cited in this review relates to children, reliable and generalisable data for the global burden in children are not readily available; the WHO estimates therefore quoted here are for both adults and children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What are the causes of CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>The causes and risk factors associated with CSOM are unclear, and few studies have examined these for CSOM. Instead authors have extrapolated results of studies for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion to CSOM. However, these studies often have conflicting findings, and there is no proven correlation between the various host and environmental factors associated with CSOM and the factors associated with acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. Despite this, some important factors that may be associated with CSOM include: environmental factors such as inadequate treatment (of CSOM and acute otitis media), poor access to medical care, poor socioeconomic conditions, season, exposure to tobacco smoke, overcrowding, attendance at day care centres, lack of breastfeeding, or poor nutrition or hygiene; and host factors such as altered immunity and underlying diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2003</LINK>), frequent upper respiratory tract infections), early onset of otitis media in the first months of life, and family history of otitis media. Some populations are at increased risk of developing CSOM, and have high rates reported, including certain ethnic groups (such as Native American tribes of Apache and Navajo, Australian Aborigines, and Inuits of Canada, Greenland and Alaska), and individuals with anatomical defects (e.g. cleft palate or submucous cleft), altered physiological defences (Eustachian tube dysfunction) or Down's syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What management approaches are there?</HEADING>
<P>The aims of treatment are to stop the discharge (and to eradicate infection), to heal the tympanic membrane, improve hearing, prevent the common problems of recurrent or new infections, and to prevent potentially life-threatening complications. Treatment options for uncomplicated CSOM include dry mopping, ear wicking, gentle syringing, or suctioning, to clean the ear discharge (aural toilet); systemic antibiotics (e.g. oral antibiotic preparations, or intravenous antibiotics); and topical treatment with either antiseptics or antibiotics, sometimes with steroids. If complications develop, surgery is usually required to remove the infected tissue from the middle ear and mastoid air cells, and possibly repair the damaged eardrum and ossicles. Each of these treatments will be considered in the following Cochrane reviews:</P>

</UL>
<P>
<BR/>A report of a WHO/CIBA Foundation Workshop held in 1996, recommends administration of topical (and/or systemic) antibiotics as well as dry mopping/wicking, since wicking alone is felt to be ineffective (as found by <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). However, the WHO guidelines still currently recommend treating CSOM by using wicking to dry the ear alone (and a five-day follow up).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Systemic versus topical treatment</HEADING>
<P>A number of topical antibiotics and antiseptics have been used in the treatment of CSOM. However, concern exists regarding their ability to penetrate the middle ear and mastoid cavities as well as their activity against the causative bacteria (usually gram-negative). There also remains controversy and uncertainty about the possible ototoxic effect, in particular of topical aminoglycoside antibiotics (by damaging the hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea), particularly where the eardrum is not intact. For this reason, systemic treatments are still often recommended and used in preference over topical antibiotics, where the eardrum is not intact. However, topical treatment may be superior to systemic treatment in terms of efficacy and also safety, although this needs investigating, particularly as systemic antibiotics are often more easily available and remain widely used in many low and middle-income settings.</P>

We excluded studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria for this review and stated the reason in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for clarification.</P>
<P>JA and Carrol Gamble (CG) provided a second opinion on trials CM had selected for inclusion, and the three authors resolved any disagreements through discussion.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:24:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CM extracted data of study characteristics, including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes, and recorded these on standard forms. JA provided further information where this had been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 1998</LINK>). In studies where data were insufficient or missing, we contacted the authors of the original studies for additional data and/or verification of methods, to clarify any uncertainties about the data and the way in which they were collected, and to try to obtain missing data.</P>
<P>CSOM can occur in one or both ears for each participant, which means participants can be counted more than once if ears are used as the unit of analysis. Where outcomes were reported in number of ears only, we also attempted to obtain the values for number of participants; numbers of ears were used where this information could not be obtained. We checked the data and resolved any discrepancies by referring to the trial report, through discussion.</P>
<P>Where possible we extracted data to allow an intention to treat analysis (i.e. the analysis should include all the participants in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned). If the number randomised and the numbers analysed were inconsistent, we calculated a percent loss-to-follow-up and reported this information in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. For binary outcomes, we recorded total number of participants (or ears, where participant numbers were unavailable) and number with the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, for each group, we extracted the number of participants, and the arithmetic means and standard deviations. If the data were reporting using geometric means, we planned to extract standard deviations on the log scale. We planned to extract medians and ranges, and report these in additional tables if any trials reported these.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:24:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CM assessed the methodological quality of all the trials identified as eligible for inclusion. CG reviewed trials where there was any ambiguity about the methods used, and JA provided further information where this had already been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 1998</LINK>). Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for further clarification.</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and inclusion of randomised participants. We classified generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and inclusion of randomised participants as adequate, inadequate and unclear as outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>. Blinding is classified as double blind, single blind, or open.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:24:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CM entered data into <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-4.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 4.2</LINK>.</P>
<P>In studies that enrolled people with otitis externa, draining surgical cavities or acute otitis media, as well as CSOM, we only included the results for just CSOM participants if the authors reported accounting for diagnosis at randomisation (e.g. stratified by diagnosis) and presented results by diagnosis. Where information was not reported regarding whether alternative diagnostic groups were accounted for at randomisation, we included all participants (groups may be unbalanced, and decisions by trialists to report subgroups may have been linked to trend). We also included all participants where separate results were not available. See additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for details. For crossover trials, we have only taken the results before participants were crossed over to the alternative treatment, where possible; otherwise results for all participants combining pre- and post-crossover data were used.</P>
<P>For binary data, we combined trials using relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We combined trials with continuous data using the weighted mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. Where data have been reported using medians and ranges, or there is evidence of skewed data, we reported medians and ranges where possible (dividing mean by the standard deviation; results of &lt; 1.64 indicate a positive skew). If continuous data were reported using geometric means, we combined the findings on a log scale and report on the original scale.</P>
<P>Quinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin) and non-quinolone antibiotics (e.g. gentamicin) are presented as separate subgroups within each comparison, but not combined across trials. This was done as there is a clinical interest in the difference in effectiveness of quinolones compared to non-quinolones, as quinolones are thought to be more effective and safer but more expensive.</P>
<P>Where heterogeneity is considered to be present, and it remained clinically appropriate to combine data, we also used DerSimonian &amp; Laird random effects model, and reported both fixed and random effects results.</P>
<P>The primary analysis is of all eligible studies. If a sufficient number of trials is available for future updates (not available for each comparison in this version of the review), we will explore whether heterogeneity can be explained using subgroup analyses or meta-regression for the following factors: age (under 16, and adults 16 years or older), associated mopping (dividing studies into those with some form of ear toilet, and those without), co-interventions (dividing studies into those with treatment comparison alone, and those with treatment comparison in combination with other co-interventions), and methodological quality (initially excluding studies of the poorest quality). Sensitivity analyses will also be used to explore methodological quality (notably adequate concealment), and trial design (e.g. cluster randomisation). We will display the results for each sensitivity analysis according to the subgroups within each methods category.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis will include the following, as outlined in the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane ENT Group Guidelines for Reviewers (<LINK REF="REF-CochraneENTGuideline" TYPE="REFERENCE">CochraneENTGuideline</LINK> updated November 2000).</P>
<P>(1) Repeat the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if any).<BR/>(2) Repeat the analysis excluding studies of the lowest quality (already done if there is heterogeneity).<BR/>(3) If there are one or more very large studies, we will repeat the analysis excluding these, to investigate how much they dominate the results.<BR/>(4) Repeat the analysis excluding studies where people with CSOM are only a subgroup of the participants included in the study, for example, those that enrol people with otitis externa, draining surgical cavities or acute otitis media, as well as CSOM.</P>
<P>Within this version of the review, trials where people with CSOM are only a subgroup of the participants included in the study are identified - see additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this version of the review, we visually examined forest plots, in conjunction with the chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, using a 5% level of statistical significance, and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2004</LINK>). There were insufficient trials to investigate publication bias using funnel plots; this may be done in further updates of the review.</P>

<P>Where available, we have reported results for number of participants rather than ears; otherwise results for number of ears have been taken. The concern is that a trial analysed by ears rather than number of participants will have an underestimated standard error and therefore receive an inappropriate increased weight in a meta-analysis.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We excluded trials or comparisons with steroids (with or without antibiotics; see steroids review), and presented findings for topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics, and systemic plus topical antibiotics separately, to address focused and meaningful questions. These tighter comparisons and addition of new trials are why minimal heterogeneity was observed in the comparisons presented here and why some of our conclusions differ to those of an earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 1998</LINK>). Although trials that mentioned aural toilet appeared to use comparable regimens across groups, information is being requested from the trials authors to confirm this was indeed the case, and also to obtain details for the three trials that did not discuss aural toilet at all.</P>
<P>Two trials compared systemic antibiotic (mostly non-quinolones) with topical antiseptic, and did not detect any statistically significant differences between treatment groups for clinical cure. However the choice of antibiotic depended on bacterial results for both trials, and <LINK REF="STD-Browning-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Browning 1983</LINK> compared daily antibiotics with weekly antiseptic. Results were only presented for up to three and four weeks and included participants with draining mastoid cavities and other complications.</P>
<P>Topical quinolone antibiotics alone were statistically significantly better than systemic antibiotics alone. This was true for non-quinolone and quinolone systemic treatments, both of which had very similar treatment effects (pooled RR (95% CI) were: 3.21 (1.88 to 5.49) in favour of topical quinolones over systemic non-quinolones, and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) for systemic quinolones). Only one trial compared systemic antibiotics with topical non-quinolones (giving a range of non-quinolones in both groups, according to bacteriology; <LINK REF="STD-Browning-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Browning 1983</LINK>). This trial, which also gave treatment for longer and presented results later than the other trials (four weeks), was the only trial that did not find an effect in favour of topical antibiotic treatment.</P>
<P>The effect of adding topical treatment to systemic treatment was presented in two trials, both using only quinolone antibiotics. Both reported higher cure rates at one to two weeks when topical antibiotic was added to systemic treatment. However, the longer-term results were not presented. One further trial reported a beneficial effect of adding topical antibiotic to systemic treatment, using non-quinolone antibiotics, but did not provide full results (<LINK REF="STD-Mira-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mira 1992</LINK>); further details have been requested from the authors for the results of this trial.</P>
<P>Three trials assessed the effect of adding systemic antibiotics to topical treatment (i.e. compared topical antibiotic alone to systemic and topical antibiotics), all reporting results at one to two weeks only. When using quinolones in both treatment groups (two trials), no benefit was found when adding systemic antibiotics to topical treatment, with no statistically significant difference for cure. However, a statistically significant difference in favour of topical antibiotic was found when systemic and topical non-quinolone antibiotics were compared to topical quinolones (<LINK REF="STD-Supiyaphun-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Supiyaphun 2000</LINK>). No trials found a statistically significant effect in favour of keeping systemic antibiotic in the treatment regimen. This is a useful finding, given the added cost and likely reduced adherence when using a combination of treatments instead of monotherapy.</P>
<P>Systemic adverse effects noted by the authors included gastric complaints and one case of skin rash. Topical effects were mainly local, including fungal growth (otomycosis), pain on drops (37% with chloramphenicol compared to 5.1% with ofloxacin in one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Supiyaphun-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Supiyaphun 2000</LINK>), and tinnitus (one case, on oral amoxicillin and topical chloramphenicol, which resolved on discontinuing the drops: <LINK REF="STD-Supiyaphun-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Supiyaphun 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Supiyaphun-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Supiyaphun 2000</LINK> also report a significant elevation (i.e. deterioration) of bone conduction and speech reception threshold, and significantly higher ototoxic rates for participants receiving oral amoxicillin and topical chloramphenicol (non-quinolone) than for those on topical ofloxacin (quinolone), which was attributed to the chloramphenicol. No other trials in this review reported any worsening of audiometry results or evidence of ototoxicity. However, ototoxicity has been observed for various non-quinolone antibiotics, and aminoglycoside antibiotics are not recommended in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1997</LINK>). One review of ototoxicity cases in humans reported that ototoxicity may be primarily due to vestibular damage (causing imbalance and dizziness) rather than cochlear (<LINK REF="REF-Marais-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marais 1998</LINK>), so assessments of hearing thresholds for bone conduction alone would be unlikely to detect many cases (<LINK REF="REF-Marais-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marais 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lancaster-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lancaster 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The follow-up period in all trials included here was short. No trials assessed longer-term effects of treatment, or reported time to resolution or to reappearance of discharge and perforation, or results for healing of the tympanic membrane. As conclusions can change over time, it may be important to investigate the longer-term effects in future trials.</P>
<P>Most of the trials in this review were poor quality, with short follow-up. Many included a range of participants (e.g. including otitis externa, or draining mastoid cavities, or cholesteatomatous disease). This may explain some of the heterogeneity found, since resolution rates may vary widely between diagnoses, and so make the results less applicable to any one type of disease. Trials were also inconsistent in approaches for handling and reporting bilateral disease. Where available, we have reported results for number of participants rather than ears; otherwise results for number of ears have been taken. The concern is that a trial analysed by ears rather than number of participants will have an underestimated standard error and therefore receive an inappropriate increased weight in a meta-analysis. We will use the information obtained to attempt to address the issues of inflated weighting for trials reporting numbers of ears, in a later update of this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Short courses of topical quinolone antibiotics are more effective than systemic antibiotics alone for the short-term resolution of otorrhoea from uncomplicated CSOM. The effects of topical non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) or antiseptics are less clear, when compared to systemic treatment; no benefit of adding systemic treatment to topical antibiotics was detected either, although evidence was limited. Less is known about longer-term outcomes (for dry ear, or to prevent complications, heal the eardrum, and improve hearing), or about treating complicated CSOM. Evidence regarding safety is also weak, and more research is needed to clarify the risk of ototoxicity with alternative treatments (about which there is much concern, particularly for topical aminoglycosides), and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than alternative topical or systemic treatments. Treatment should therefore be accompanied by regular medical follow-up and clinical vigilance, also monitoring for adverse effects of treatment (particularly for local effects or signs of ototoxicity), or for complications of the disease. Clinical staff should also advise patients and their caregivers on appropriate ear care, with aural toilet and effective instillation of the drops, ensuring the drops reach the site of infection to work effectively.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials should clarify the effects of non-quinolone antibiotics and antiseptics. Adequately designed and powered studies should focus on the effects on the longer-term natural history of CSOM, such as healing of the tympanic membrane, hearing improvement, prevention of complications, and also on further safety assessments. Other more comprehensive systematic reviews should also assess safety further, particularly to verify the risks of ototoxicity for alternative treatments. Trialists should also consider how they handle bilateral disease and also the type of participants included (or stratify randomisation by diagnosis if various diagnoses are included), to ensure the results are clinically relevant to a particular patient group. The cost effectiveness of alternative treatments, preferably through economic evaluations alongside clinical trials, would be valuable in guiding both clinical practice and health policy.</P>

<CONTRIBUTIONS>
<P>Jose Acuin (JA) was the primary author for the Cochrane Review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (Acuin 1998), that this review replaces.</P>
<P>Carolyn Macfadyen (CM) designed the current review, in consultation with JA.</P>
<P>CM and JA worked with Gemma Healy (GH) and Carolyn Doree (CD), the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Search Co-ordinators, for the search strategy development. GH ran the initial electronic searches, and performed a preliminary screen of the search results; CD ran the search update in March 2005. Both searches were carried out independently.</P>
<P>CM and JA independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified during the search for preliminary assessment, and CM retrieved and reviewed the full papers for all potentially relevant studies. CM will organise retrieval of future unpublished studies, and will contact authors for additional information or clarifications where needed.</P>
<P>CM assessed the methodological quality of all trials identified for inclusion, extracted data, and entered data into Review Manager 4.2 for analysis. JA and Carrol Gamble (CG) provided a second opinion on trials CM had selected for inclusion; CG reviewed those where there was any ambiguity about the methods used, for the methodological quality and data extraction; and JA provided further information where this had been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (Acuin 1998). The three authors resolved any disagreements through discussion.</P>
<P>None of the authors have worked on any trials included in the review.</P>
<P>CM wrote the final review, with statistical and clinical input from CG and JA. All three authors provided the methodological perspective; CG also provides the statistical perspective and JA the clinical perspective.</P>

<P>The following changes were made to the eligibility criteria and outcome measures from those stipulated in the protocol:</P>
<P>1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA<BR/>Types of studies: quasi-randomised controlled trials were specified in the protocol but excluded from the review.</P>
<P>Types of participants:<BR/>Protocol: People of any age with a diagnosis of CSOM meeting the WHO definition<BR/>Review: any diagnosis of CSOM as defined by the trial authors.</P>
<P>Types of interventions - the following were stipulated in the protocol:<BR/>Intervention: topical (aural) antibiotics (all and individual)<BR/>Comparator: no intervention; placebo; other topical antibiotics with and without steroids; systemic antibiotics (all and individual); combination of topical and systemic antibiotics; antiseptics.</P>
<P>However, we have divided these trials into the following three reviews:<BR/>* Topical treatment with antibiotics<BR/>comparisons: no treatment or aural toilet, topical antiseptics, various topical antibiotics, excluding steroids<BR/>* Systemic versus topical treatments for CSOM (THIS REVIEW)<BR/>comparisons: any systemic treatment against any topical treatment excluding steroids<BR/>* Systemic or topical steroids, as monotherapy or combination therapy<BR/>comparisons: no treatment or aural toilet, topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics</P>
<P>2. OUTCOMES<BR/>Types of outcome measures - the following primary outcomes have been changed:<BR/>Protocol:<BR/>* Resolution of CSOM at 2 to 4 weeks and after 4 weeks, according to the following findings:<BR/>a) No report of otorrhoea<BR/>b) Disappearance of discharge on otoscopy<BR/>c) Healing of the eardrum perforation on otoscopy<BR/>d) Time to resolution of CSOM according to any other definition of resolution made by the authors, including improvement in mucosal appearance</P>
<P>Review:<BR/>* Resolution of CSOM at 2 to 4 weeks, and after 4 weeks, according to the investigators' criteria.<BR/>We have also analysed results for treatment failure rather than success.</P>
<P>The others were analysed as separate, secondary outcomes (where reported by trialists):<BR/>* Healing of perforation at 2 to 4 weeks, and after 4 weeks;<BR/>* Time to resolution of CSOM as defined by the investigators.</P>
<P>The other protocol outcomes were unchanged, except that results before 2 weeks were also included and reported separately.</P>
<P>3. SEARCH STRATEGY<BR/>The protocol stated that we would obtain all relevant studies regardless of publication status. However, trials reported in conference proceedings or on posters have not yet been sought, but will be sought for inclusion in an update of this review. Additionally, the further potential sources that we will search for future updates of this review, were also specified in the protocol for this review.</P>
<P>4. METHODS - REVIEWERS' CONTRIBUTIONS<BR/>The protocol stated that we would follow the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane ENT Group Guidelines for Reviewers (CochraneENTGuideline, updated November 2000), and that two reviewers (CM and JA) would independently:<BR/>* select trials (at least for electronic searches), review the titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy, and assess full texts for eligibility;<BR/>* assess the methodological quality of all trials identified as eligible for inclusion (and report the level of agreement between the two reviewers);<BR/>* extract data of study characteristics, including methods, participants, interventions and outcomes, and record these on standard forms; and<BR/>* enter data onto Review Manager 4.2.</P>
<P>However, while CM and JA independently reviewed titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy, only CM assessed the full texts for eligibility and methodological quality, extracted data, and entered data onto Review Manager 4.2. JA and CG provided a second opinion on trials CM had selected for inclusion; CG reviewed those where there was any ambiguity about the methods used, for the methodological quality and data extraction; and JA provided further information where this had been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (Acuin 1998). The three authors resolved any disagreements through discussion.</P>
<P>5. ASSESSMENT OF METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY<BR/>The protocol stated that allocation concealment, and inclusion of randomised participants, would be assessed as inadequate if an allocation concealment approach was not reported, or it was not clear how many people were originally randomised into the trial, respectively. However, we have classed these as unclear.</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the following dimensions and criteria based on four methodological aspects.</P>
<P>a) Generation of allocation sequence</P>
<P>Adequate: if sequences are suitable to prevent selection bias and the method used is described.<BR/>Adequate methods include random numbers generated by computer, table of random numbers, drawing of lots or envelopes, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, throwing dice, or other methods of allocation that appear to be unbiased.</P>
<P>Unclear: stated but method not described.<BR/>The trial describes itself as being randomised but no further information is given.</P>
<P>Inadequate: if sequence could be related to prognosis.<BR/>Inadequate methods include case record number, date of birth, time, day, month or year of admission.</P>
<P>b) Allocation concealment</P>
<P>Adequate: if participants and investigators enrolling participants cannot foresee assignment. Adequate measures include a priori numbered or coded containers of identical appearance, central randomisation; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other descriptions that contained convincing elements of concealment.</P>
<P>Inadequate: trials in which the authors reported an approach that could not be considered adequate (e.g. methods of allocation such as alternation methods or use of case record numbers are not concealed).</P>
<P>Unclear: trials in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or allocation concealment was stated but method not described.</P>
<P>Baseline comparison of experimental groups will confirm whether treatment arm allocation appears to be unbiased.</P>
<P>c) Blinding</P>
<P>Double blind: the trial uses a placebo, or a double dummy technique such that neither the participant or care provider/assessor know which treatment is given.</P>
<P>Single blind: the participant or care provider/assessor is aware of the treatment given.</P>
<P>Open: all parties are aware of treatment.</P>
<P>d) Inclusion of all randomised participants</P>
<P>Adequate: More than 90% of people randomised in the trial were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Inadequate: Less than 90% of those randomised in to the trial were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Unclear: It is not clear how many people were originally randomised into the trial or analysed.</P>
<P>6. DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The protocol stated that we would only include the results for CSOM participants where available, for studies that also enrolled people with otitis externa, draining surgical cavities or acute otitis media. However, we only did so if the authors reported stratifying randomisation by diagnosis. Where information was not reported regarding whether alternative diagnostic groups were stratified at randomisation, we included all participants (groups may be unbalanced, and decisions by trialists to report subgroups may have been linked to trend).</P>
