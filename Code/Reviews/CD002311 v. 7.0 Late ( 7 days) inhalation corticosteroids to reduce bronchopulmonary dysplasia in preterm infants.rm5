<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does inhalation of corticosteroids after the first week of life reduce the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants? This review looked at studies comparing preterm infants at risk of developing BPD after the first week of life treated with inhalation corticosteroids to those treated with inhalation placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Preterm infants have an increased risk of developing chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Inflammation in the lung seems to play a central role in the development of BPD. Administration of anti-inflammatory drugs known as corticosteroids into the bloodstream (systemically) reduces the risk of BPD but can also cause serious side effects. Administering corticosteroids via inhalation directly into the lungs may reduce these side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified eight studies investigating this therapy in 232 infants. Although we deemed the risk of bias as low, very few studies reported our outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The included trials did not show a beneficial effect of inhalation corticosteroids on death or BPD. In addition, the safety of inhalation corticosteroids was assessed in only a small number of trials. Based on these results, inhalation corticosteroids initiated after the first week of life cannot be recommended for preterm infants at risk of BPD. More studies are needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was low to very low for the main outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-30 17:41:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), remains an important complication of prematurity. Pulmonary inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Attenuating pulmonary inflammation with postnatal systemic corticosteroids reduces the incidence of BPD in preterm infants but may be associated with an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Local administration of corticosteroids via inhalation might be an effective and safe alternative.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-04 14:03:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine if administration of inhalation corticosteroids after the first week of life until 36 weeks PMA to preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD is effective and safe in reducing the incidence of death and BPD as separate or combined outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-04 13:29:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 19 May 2017), Embase (1980 to 19 May 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 19 May 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials<B>.</B>

</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-30 17:42:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing inhalation corticosteroids, started &#8805; 7 days postnatal age (PNA) but before 36 weeks PMA, to placebo in ventilated and non-ventilated infants at risk of BPD. We excluded trials investigating systemic corticosteroids versus inhalation corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-08-08 02:48:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We collected data on participant characteristics, trial methodology, and inhalation regimens. The primary outcome was death or BPD at 36 weeks PMA. Secondary outcomes were the combined outcome death or BPD at 28 days PNA, the seperate outcomes of death and BPD at both 28 days PNA, and at 36 weeks PMA, and short-term respiratory outcomes, such as failure to extubate; total days of mechanical ventilation and oxygen use; and the need for systemic corticosteroids. We contacted the original trialists to verify the validity of extracted data and to provide missing data. We analysed all data using Review Manager 5. When possible, we performed meta-analysis using typical risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed ventilated and non-ventilated participants separately.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-08 03:09:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight trials randomising 232 preterm infants in this review. Inhalation corticosteroids did not reduce the separate or combined outcomes of death or BPD. The meta-analyses of the studies showed a reduced risk in favor of inhalation steroids regarding failure to extubate at seven days (typical RR (TRR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; 5 studies, 79 infants) and at the latest reported time point after treatment onset (TRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80; 6 studies, 90 infants). However, both analyses showed increased statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 73% and 86%, respectively). Furthermore, inhalation steroids did not impact total duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen dependency. There was a trend toward a reduction in the use of systemic corticosteroids in infants receiving inhalation corticosteroids (TRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.00; 4 studies, 74 infants; very low-quality evidence). There was a paucity of data on short- and long-term adverse effects. Our results should be interpreted with caution because the total number of randomised participants is relatively small, and most trials differed considerably in participant characteristics, inhalation therapy, and outcome definitions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:09:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the results of the currently available evidence, inhalation corticosteroids initiated at &#8805; 7 days of life for preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD cannot be recommended at this point in time. More and larger randomised, placebo-controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of inhalation corticosteroids.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-02 02:10:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as oxygen dependency at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), is the most important complication of prematurity, with a reported incidence of 23% in infants born at 28 weeks and increasing to 73% in infants born at 23 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2010</LINK>). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is characterised by prolonged respiratory support, compromised lung function, and recurrent respiratory infections during the first years of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, BPD is considered an independent risk factor for neurodevelopmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Short-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Short 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2005</LINK>). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a multifactorial disease with mechanical ventilation, oxygen toxicity, and pre- and postnatal infection as the most important risk factors, and pulmonary inflammation playing a central mediating role.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-30 18:09:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention of interest was inhaled corticosteroids administered to either ventilated or non-ventilated newborn infants at risk of developing BPD. Budesonide, beclomethasone, and fluticasone are the most frequently used inhaled corticosteroids in newborn infants, and these drugs are almost exclusively delivered using a pressurised metered dose inhaler or a nebuliser. Studies in preterm infants have revealed that metered-dose inhalation results in a far better deposition than nebulisation. In addition, inhalation via an endotracheal tube provides better deposition than inhalation via a face mask (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-02 02:10:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulmonary inflammation plays a central modulating role in the pathogenesis of BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEvoy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEvoy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1995</LINK>). Corticosteroids have a strong anti-inflammatory effect, making them an ideal candidate to attenuate the inflammatory response associated with BPD. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that systemic administration of corticosteroids reduces the incidence of BPD and the combined outcome of death or BPD in ventilated preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>). However, systemic corticosteroids are also associated with short-term (e.g. hyperglycaemia, hypertension, infection) and long-term (neurodevelopmental impairment) adverse effects. This balance between beneficial and adverse effects of corticosteroids may be more favourable when using the inhalation route because, ideally, inhaled corticosteroids should demonstrate high pulmonary deposition in addition to a low systemic bioavailability and rapid systemic clearance.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-02 02:10:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The association between early (&lt; 7 days of life) systemic corticosteroids use and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes has resulted in a reduction in the overall use of corticosteroids in ventilated preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Cheong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheong 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoder-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoder 2009</LINK>). Administering corticosteroids by inhalation might be a safe and effective alternative, and this method of administering corticosteroids to infants at risk for BPD is already frequently being used in every part of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Job-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Job 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogawa-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogawa 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slaughter-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slaughter 2014</LINK>). A systematic review of the randomised evidence on inhaled corticosteroids in preterm infants was first published in the Cochrane Library in 1999, followed by an update in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Lister-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister 2000</LINK>). The second update of this systematic review included those RCTs published after 2002 and extended the inclusion criteria by including all RCTs initiating inhalation corticosteroids after the first week of life, in line with the Cochrane Reviews on systemic corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>). The conclusions of that review were that in ventilated infants, administration of inhalation corticosteroids resulted in an improved rate of extubation without any apparent adverse effects. No firm conclusions could be drawn for non-ventilated infants (<LINK REF="REF-Onland-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onland 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: the combined outcome of BPD or death at 36 weeks PMA, as well as the combined outcomes of death or cerebral palsy, and death or abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome, and open-label rescue therapy of systemic corticosteroids during study medication or after study medication was stopped.</P>
<P>Two review authors (WO and AvK) independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias. We used GRADEpro to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Arnon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arnon 1996</LINK>: This double-blind trial included 20 preterm infants with a birthweight &lt; 2000 grams and a gestational age &lt; 33 weeks that were still in need of mechanical ventilation at 14 days PNA with a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8805; 0.30. Participants with PDA, sepsis, air leak, or congenital malformation were not included. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to budesonide 600 &#956;g twice daily or placebo given by metered-dose inhalation (MDI), inserted into small volume spacer, for seven days or until extubation, whichever came first. From the reported outcome parameters, only the rate of PDA and sepsis rate during the study period could be used for this review. The authors provided additional data on extubation rate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK>: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial conducted in six centres in France over a two-year period. A total of 86 preterm infants with gestational age &lt; 31 weeks, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and in need of mechanical ventilation, nasal ventilation, or continuous positive airway pressure at 10 days PNA were included in this study. Infants with PDA, sepsis, pulmonary infections, major malformation, or prior treatment with corticosteroids or bronchodilators were excluded. Although this study consisted of four treatment arms, only those infants treated with beclomethasone 250 &#956;g/puff delivered by a MDI (inserted into a small volume spacer) four times a day or placebo were included in this review. Therapy was started on the 10th or 11th day and given for 28 days with a tapering dose for the last eight days. The primary outcome was BPD, defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days PNA in combination with radiographic abnormalities consistent with BPD. However, except for the total duration of supplemental oxygen, all outcomes of interest for this review were presented for the combined group of ventilated and non-ventilated infants and were therefore excluded from the final analysis. The author provided additional data on the randomisation process. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dugas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dugas 2005</LINK>: This was a double-blind, randomised trial of 32 infants with a gestational age &#8804; 32 weeks, postnatal age between 28 and 60 days, and a diagnosis of BPD, which was defined as FiO<SUB>2 </SUB>&#8805; 0.25 to maintain oxygen saturation between 88% and 92%, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<SUB>2</SUB>) &#8805; 45 mmHg, and chest radiography consistent with BPD. Reasons for exclusion were hypertension, hyperglycaemia, sepsis, pneumonia, renal failure, treatment with corticosteroids five days prior to inclusion, a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8805; 0.30 in ventilated or FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8805; 0.40 in non-ventilated infants, and congenital heart disease. The infants were treated with placebo or fluticasone propionate 125 &#956;g/puff given by MDI inserted into a small volume spacer and interposed between an anaesthesia bag and the tube or a face mask. Infants with a birthweight between 500 and 1200 grams received one puff twice daily for three weeks and once daily in the fourth week. The number of puffs was double if the infant's weight was &#8805; 1200 grams. The primary outcome was the total duration of supplemental oxygen. Other outcomes, such as total duration of hospitalisation or duration of mechanical ventilation, were only reported for the combined group of ventilated and non-ventilated infants and therefore could not be used for this review. From the reported outcome parameters, only mortality at 36 weeks PMA, mortality at hospital discharge, open-label intravenous glucocorticoids, and hyperglycaemia during the study period in the ventilated subgroup could be used for this review. The original authors did not provide additional data.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Giep-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Giep 1996</LINK>: A total of 19 infants were included in this feasibility and safety study with a randomised design. Infants were eligible if their birthweight was between 500 and 1500 grams, the X-ray showed signs of RDS or BPD, the postnatal age was at least 14 days, and the infant was still mechanically ventilated with a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 0.40 and a peak inspiratory pressure &gt; 14 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O after failing an extubation attempt. Infants with PDA, sepsis, congenital heart disease, congenital malformations, or previous postnatal or concurrent administration of corticosteroids were not included. The participating infants were randomised to be treated with beclomethasone (1 mg/kg/day) or placebo delivered by MDI and an AeroChamber. Infants weighing 500 to 799 grams, 800 to 1000 grams, 1001 to 1300 grams, and above 1300 grams were treated with three, four, five, and six puffs every eight hours, respectively, for a total duration of seven days. We included the reported outcomes failure to extubate, use of systemic corticosteroids, sepsis rate, and intraventricular haemorrhage in this review. Although data on blood pressure and blood glucose were reported on a daily basis, the number of infants with hypertension and hyperglycaemia was not reported.

Infants with malformations, congenital heart disease, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III-IV, deteriorating ventilator settings, or on high frequency ventilation were excluded. Starting on day seven of life, infants were treated with a dose of 500 &#956;g twice a day for a total duration of 14 days. Reported outcomes of interest for this review were use of open-label corticosteroids, failure to extubate on day 14 in the ventilated subgroup, and mortality at hospital discharge and at 36 weeks PMA. The authors provided separate data for the ventilated and non-ventilated subgroups for the outcomes oxygen requirements at 28 days of age and at 36 weeks PMA, duration of supplemental oxygen, duration of mechanical ventilation, failure to extubate, and the adverse outcomes hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and sepsis.</P>

Infants with PDA, pneumonia, sepsis, congenital heart disease, or an air leak were not included. Those allocated to the intervention group were treated with nebulised beclomethasone dipropionate 50 &#956;g three times a day for 28 days. Medication was delivered via a Whisper Jet nebuliser system in the ventilator circuit or a blow-by with 8 litre of humidified gas per minute in ventilated and non-ventilated infants, respectively.

This study had two phases, with only the second phase having a randomised, placebo-controlled design. We used data on the 18 infants included in this second phase for this review. Infants with sepsis, pulmonary hypoplasia, congenital anomalies, or heart disease were excluded. Infants were randomly assigned to dexamethasone inhalation 1 mg/kg 8-hourly for seven days followed by 0.5 mg/kg for three days or placebo using a jet nebuliser. The reported outcomes of interest for this review were the use of intravenous corticosteroids, duration of mechanical ventilation, days on supplemental oxygen, and total duration of hospitalisation.

No inclusion or exclusion criteria were described. This study was available only as an abstract, reporting clinical and respiratory outcomes without dichotomous or continuous data. Continuous data on the mean number of intubation days were reported with neither standard deviations nor standard errors, therefore these data could not be used. The rates of extubation were stated, although not on which day after initiating therapy. We used these data in the outcome failure to extubate at the latest reported time point.

Ten infants were withdrawn and did not complete the study: five because of sepsis (three placebo, two treatment group), four because of PDA (two in each group), and one because of an air leak (treatment group).

The pharmacist in charge of the medication, the treating physician, and the investigators were unaware of treatment allocation. Three infants in the placebo group did not complete the study protocol (two because of clinical pulmonary deterioration and one because of central line sepsis).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-02 02:20:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the predefined inclusion criteria, this systematic review identified eight relatively small RCTs comparing inhalation corticosteroids to placebo in a total of 232 ventilated and non-ventilated preterm infants. These trials differed considerably in participant characteristics, intervention (medication, dose, duration, and delivery), reported outcomes, and the definitions of these outcomes. This heterogeneity and the small number of randomised infants should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this review.</P>
<P>As the aim of this review was to examine the use of inhalation corticosteroids to prevent BPD, we chose the endpoint of inclusion to exclude those trials investigating inhaled corticosteroids in preterms with established BPD after 36 weeks PMA. It is, to our knowledge, unknown how much time before the primary endpoint BPD the inhaled corticosteroids might be effective. It could be argued that therapy would need to be initiated two weeks before that endpoint, or even four weeks before, as there needs to be an exposure for some time to reduce inflammation. The only trial that could have theoretically included infants around the corrected gestation of 36 weeks PMA could not provide us with data on the primary outcome BPD at 36 weeks PMA (<LINK REF="STD-Dugas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dugas 2005</LINK>). All of the other included trials treated infants for an average of eight weeks. Consequently, we feel that the inclusion criteria fulfilled the purpose of this review.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of reported and provided data showed that inhalation corticosteroids do not improve the separate or combined outcomes mortality or BPD at any time point during hospitalisation. In addition, there were no significant differences in the short-term respiratory outcomes such as failure to extubate at 14 days, total days of mechanical ventilation, or days of supplemental oxygen. This is despite the fact that several studies reported that inhalation corticosteroids improved resistance and compliance of the respiratory system, sometimes resulting in a reduction in FiO<SUB>2</SUB> or respiratory rate. However, the heterogeneity in how lung function was measured and the data were reported prevented a valid meta-analysis of these outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Arnon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arnon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giep-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Giep 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LaForce-1993" TYPE="STUDY">LaForce 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pappagallo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pappagallo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pokriefka-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pokriefka 1993</LINK>). This review showed a significant reduction in failure to extubate at day seven, and at the latest reported time point, but these analyses were seriously hampered by moderate to high statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 73% and 86%, respectively). No firm conclusions can therefore be drawn from these analyses. One possible explanation for this heterogeneity might be that the trials reporting these outcomes used different drugs and methods of delivery.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis did show a trend to a reduced use of systemic corticosteroids for the reduction of BPD in the inhaled corticosteroids group. In light of the growing concerns about the adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids, this might prove to be an important and clinically relevant finding. However, the lack of data on short- and long-term adverse effects in most trials precludes any firm conclusions at this time.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-31 20:59:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall completeness and applicability of this review are low for several reasons. First, most of the manuscripts identified by the search strategy had either an observational study design or were not placebo controlled, instead comparing systemic versus inhalation corticosteroids, and were therefore not eligible for inclusion. The numbers of participants within each of these included trials were small, which limits their power to detect small but clinically important effects of treatment. Second, most placebo-controlled trials investigating inhalation corticosteroids differed considerably in terms of participant characteristics and study design, including differences in type of inhalation medication, dose, duration of therapy, and delivery systems. It is unknown if and how these factors modify the treatment effect of inhalation corticosteroids on the outcome parameters reported in this review since we were unable to perform sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of different drugs, dosages, delivery systems, and treatment duration on the magnitude of the expected benefit. Third, not all trials reported the primary and secondary outcome parameters. Various definitions were used, and outcomes were assessed at different time points. Our extended attempts to retrieve unpublished data did not change this shortcoming.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-04 14:15:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three out of the eight included studies did not report allocation concealment, and the majority of included studies did not report adequacy of allocation sequence (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). However, all but one included trial reported adequate blinding of the intervention, therefore we judged the quality of these RCTs as moderate to high. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the evidence provided by the meta-analyses using the GRADE approach for each outcome was assessed as low to very low due to inconsistency, imprecision of the effect estimates, and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The sample size of the reported outcomes was small, resulting in inadequate power to detect clinically relevant differences in all of the important outcomes. Even if all the trials were to have reported on the same outcomes, the meta-analyses are at high risk of inconsistency due to the considerable diversity between the different trials in design, choice of drugs, dosage, and delivery systems.</P>

<P>Inhalation corticosteroids administered after the first week of life to preterm infants do not improve the separate or combined outcomes of mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at any time point during hospitalisation. Although inhalation corticosteroids might improve short-term lung function as shown by a reduced incidence of failure to extubate in the corticosteroid group, this does not seem to impact the duration of mechanical ventilation. The meta-analyses of the outcomes failure to extubate at seven days after initiation and at latest reported time point were hampered by statistical heterogeneity. We can only speculate about the source of this heterogeneity, but one possible explanation may be that the trials used different drugs, dosages, and delivery systems. Furthermore, inhalation corticosteroids may reduce the use of systemic corticosteroids, but the clinical relevance of this treatment effect is unclear, as short- and long-term adverse effects of inhalation corticosteroids are under-reported. The results of this meta-analysis are compromised by the fact that most of the included trials were underpowered and were heterogeneous in design. Based on these results, the use of inhalation corticosteroids initiated at &#8805; 7 days of life for preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD cannot be recommended.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-31 21:22:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies are needed to determine the optimal inhaled corticosteroid drug, dose, duration, and device using short-term markers of lung function and inflammation. The optimal treatment regimen should be tested in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial including a large number of preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD. The trial design should avoid bias by using adequate allocation concealment and a double-blinded intervention and outcome assessment. Outcomes should be reported using predefined, modern definitions and timing and using accepted diagnostic tests for these outcomes. Data should be collected for the primary outcome parameters BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, and mortality at 36 weeks postmenstrual age and at discharge, and a complete assessment made of major neurosensory impairment using predefined definitions. Short-term benefits (i.e. time of extubation, duration of ventilation) and adverse effects (i.e. hypertension, infection, hyperglycaemia, and the use of open-label intravenous corticosteroids) can be reported as secondary outcomes.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-02 01:59:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of the trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation and the blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. We added this information to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk for outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>high risk for outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias through the undertaking of sensitivity analyses.</P>
