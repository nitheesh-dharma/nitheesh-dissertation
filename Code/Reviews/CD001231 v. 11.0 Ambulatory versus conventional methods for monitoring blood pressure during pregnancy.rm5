<P>Not enough evidence to show whether wearing a blood pressure monitoring device for 24 hours during pregnancy is better at detecting hypertension than clinic tests.</P>
<P>High blood pressure (hypertension), when associated with protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia), can lead to serious complications during pregnancy. Measuring and monitoring blood pressure has therefore been a central feature of pregnancy care. However, the value of one-off measurements at a clinic visit have been questioned. Blood pressure measurement devices have been developed which the woman wears during her normal activities. These take several measurements, usually over a 24-hour period (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). The review of trials found there was no evidence to assess the effects of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypertensive disorders are among the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality world-wide. Blood pressure measurement plays a central role in the screening and management of hypertension during pregnancy. In recent years the validity of conventional (clinic) blood pressure measurement has been questioned and efforts have been made to improve the technique with ambulatory automated devices that provide a large number of measurements over a period of time, usually a 24-hour period.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during pregnancy improves subsequent maternal and feto-neonatal outcomes, women-newborn quality of life or use of health service resources, compared with conventional (clinic) blood pressure measurements. These effects will be assessed for the following subgroups: (1) Women at low or average risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (unselected). (2) Women defined as high risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. (3) Women with hypertension without other signs of pre-eclampsia. (4) Women with established pre-eclampsia.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-14 22:15:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypertensive disorders are among the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality world-wide (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 1985</LINK>). Pregnancy-induced hypertension alone carries little added risk for mother or fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Page-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 1993</LINK>). However, when high blood pressure is associated with proteinuria, a condition known as pre-eclampsia, there are increased risks for the mother and her baby. </P>
<P>When severe, this disease can lead to serious maternal problems including convulsions, cerebral (brain) haemorrhage, separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (abruptio placentae), clotting dysfunctions that cause widespread bleeding (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy), accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary tissues (pulmonary edema), renal (kidney) failure, liver haemorrhage and even death. The risks for the fetus include severe growth retardation (fetus grows at a slower rate than expected), asphyxia, preterm birth and death (<LINK REF="REF-MacGillivray-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacGillivray 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naeye-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naeye 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibai-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 1996</LINK>). Women with chronic underlying hypertension that precedes pregnancy are at increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia, abruptio placentae and poor perinatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Sibai-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>A key question is whether a combination of screening methods, prophylactic measures and active interventions in the form of rest or medication will prevent progression of pregnancy induced hypertension or chronic hypertension to more severe forms of the disease and improve maternal and perinatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 1997</LINK>). Blood pressure measurement plays a central role in these strategies, and is almost always measured whenever pregnant women attend antenatal clinics. Despite its widespread use, conventional blood-pressure readings are prone to inaccuracy due to observer and device error, and evidence suggests that health professionals involved in antenatal care fail to take even the most basic precautions to lower error (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, blood pressure measurements are affected by the stress response associated with a hospital setting, the so called white-coat hypertension, which may occur in nearly 30% of pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 1999</LINK>). Its recognition is important, so that pregnant women are not admitted to hospital or given antihypertensive drugs unnecessarily or excessively. As a consequence attention has focused on methods of measurement that provide profiles of blood pressure behaviour rather than relying on isolated measurements under circumstances that may in themselves influence the level of blood pressure recorded (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Alternatives to conventional blood pressure measures at the clinic includes the use of automated devices for self measurement of blood pressure at home. In home blood pressure monitoring programs patients are trained to use the device and interpret readings in order to contact their physician/midwife if abnormal readings are obtained, or as an alternative readings are sent to a central facility (i.e. via telephone lines) where they are evaluated by a health care professional (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2001b</LINK>). </P>
<P>These strategies can be extended to the use of a portable automatic device that can perform repeated measurements over a predetermined length of time (typically 24 hours) while women follow their normal daily routine (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 1993</LINK>). In these devices inflation and deflation of the cuff is automatic, and blood pressure is usually determined using either brachial artery microphones to detect Korotkoff sounds or cuff oscillometry to detect cuff pressure oscillations. In this strategy, usually referred as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), women are instructed on the correct use of the monitor at the clinic, and wear the device. Then, women leave the clinic and follow a normal daily routine. Periodically, the monitor takes a measurement and stores the results. The measurement frequency can be varied, but it is usually between 20 and 30 minutes while awake and 30 and 60 minutes while sleeping. Women are encouraged to keep diaries so that the cause of sudden changes in blood pressure can be evaluated. The units function poorly during strenuous activity and work best if women slow or stop moving during readings. When the monitoring period is over, women return to the clinic and data are downloaded from the monitor to a computer for analysis. Many statistical techniques exist to evaluate ambulatory records, including plotting time of day versus blood pressure, 24 hour mean, daytime mean and night time mean blood pressure.</P>
<P>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can show alteration in the normal (circadian) pattern of blood pressure variation, a feature particularly relevant in pre-eclampsia, as these women showed an impairment in the night-time fall in blood pressure present in both the normotensive and gestational hypertensive patients (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 1997</LINK>). Several studies have evaluated different aspects of ABPM during pregnancy, and devices have been successfully validated and used to generate normal ranges throughout gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2001</LINK>). Ambulatory blood pressure correlates better with proteinuria than does conventional sphygmomanometry.; it is a better predictor of hypertensive complications, and women diagnosed by the technique as having hypertension have infants with lower birth weight than normotensive women (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2001</LINK>). Moreover, women with white coat hypertension have a higher incidence of cesarean delivery than normotensive women, suggesting that if ambulatory rather than clinic blood pressure measurement was used in the decision-making processes, caesarean delivery might be avoided (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 1999</LINK>). On the other hand, evidence also suggests that ABPM is not useful as an early predictor of pre-eclampsia and that the technique is inaccurate in women with established pre-eclampsia, with a potential large underestimation of the true blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Natarajan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natarajan 1999</LINK>). In non-pregnant subjects, there is evidence from a randomised trial suggesting that adjustment of antihypertensive treatment based on ABP monitoring instead of conventional sphygmomanometry may lead to less intensive drug treatment with preservation of BP control, general well-being, and inhibition of left ventricular enlargement (<LINK REF="REF-Staessen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staessen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>New generation devices are small, about the size of a personal cassette player, light, and quiet. When evaluated in general practice, 49% of women reported some interference with normal activity and 76% reported some disruption of sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Carney-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carney 1997</LINK>). Bed partners may also complain of interrupted sleep. There have been some reports of adverse events associated with ABPM, in particular redness of the arm, petechial skin lesions, and compartment syndrome, although the overall rate of complications seems to be low (<LINK REF="REF-Tapolyai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tapolyai 2001</LINK>). Women may be able to start or stop recordings and read the displayed results if they wish. This information may improve women's self confidence on one hand, but increase anxiety levels on the other hand. These issues need to be taken into account when evaluating the implementation of this diagnostic strategy.</P>
<P>The implementation into clinical practice of a screening or diagnostic test must lead to improved maternal and feto-neonatal clinical outcomes, quality of life or use of health service resources. Unfortunately this is not always the case, even for widely accepted procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Lancet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 1998</LINK>). A pre-requisite, other than the test ability to predict or confirm disease, involves the availability of interventions that must favourably alter the natural history of the condition, not simply by advancing the time at which diagnosis occurs, but by improving survival, function, or quality of life. Claims for benefit must be supported by experimental evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>The aims of this review are (i) to identify as many of the published and unpublished randomised controlled trials of ABPM as possible and (ii) to estimate the benefits and hazards of incorporating ABPM in the management of pregnant women. </P>
<P>Another review will compare self (home) blood pressure monitoring versus conventional (clinic) blood pressure monitoring and ABPM.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>There are currently no randomised trials which evaluate ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during pregnancy. Given the observational data suggesting that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) can enhance assessment of blood pressure in pregnancy, and experimental data in non-pregnant subjects showing that hypertensive patients monitored with ABPM might have better outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Staessen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staessen 1997</LINK>), there is a clear need for randomised trials of ABPM compared with conventional blood-pressure measurement in pregnancy, and in particular in hypertensive pregnant women. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during pregnancy. </P>

<P>As stated under "type of interventions" this systematic review included only ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as the technique to be compared against conventional (clinic) blood pressure measurements. As explained in the background of the review, for ABPM women wear an automated measurement device whilst doing their normal day to day activities and their blood pressure is measured with a large number of readings over a 24-hour period. Studies comparing self (home) blood pressure monitoring versus conventional (clinic) blood pressure monitoring were excluded from the review. Both ABPM and home monitoring allow for &#8216;white coat&#8217; hypertension, but only ABPM will evaluate circadian patterns accurately. So, the diagnostic values of the techniques might differ, and there are practical and economic considerations that can make one technique effective while the other might be ineffective or impractical. For example, ABPM equipment is expensive and the output is complex and needs skilled interpretation. It might be argued that both methods could be combined into a single review, but at the time of protocol development this issue was discussed and it was decided to conduct two independent systematic reviews. The second review has not been published.</P>
