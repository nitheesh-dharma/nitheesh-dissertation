(4) How did you perform the ITT analysis?&lt;br&gt;2. Two studies in &amp;quot;Studies awaiting assessment&amp;quot; were deleted because they were included in a non controlled phase IV study wich was published in May 2005 (Dr. Ji Yanyan fax me this paper).&lt;br&gt;3.

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Evidence on beneficial or harmful effects of bicyclol for chronic hepatitis C is not found</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti-hepatitis' drug, used primarily in China for patients with chronic hepatitis B. No well-designed randomised clinical trials were found evaluating the benefits or possible harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B. Clinicians should be aware of this lack of evidence for bicyclol. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti-hepatitis' drug, used in China for chronic hepatitis B. Until now, systematic reviews of bicyclol therapy have not been performed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To study the benefits and harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(July 2005), The <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 2, 2005), <I>MEDLINE</I> (1950 to July 2005), <I>EMBASE</I> (1980 to July 2005), <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> (1945 to July 2005), <I>The Chinese Biomedical Database</I> (1994 to August 2005), <I>VIP Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database </I>(1994 to August 2005), and <I>China National Infrastructure</I> (CNKI)(1994 to August 2005). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials with bicyclol versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions were included, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The primary outcome measures were mortality (total and liver-related) and liver-related morbidity (eg, cirrhosis and carcinoma). Secondary outcome measures were viral response and liver histology.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The search identified one randomised clinical trial comparing bicyclol with bifendate (biphenyldicarboxylate) for patients with hepatitis B. The follow-up was three months. There was no evidence that bicyclol was superior to bifendate for loss of HBeAg (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.00), seroconversion of HBeAg to HBeAb (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.29), loss of HBV DNA (RR 1.19, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.53), or number of patients with normalised alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11 and RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20, respectively).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Only one randomised clinical trial has examined the potential benefit of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B. This small, short-term trial found no evidence to support or refute its use. Large, randomised double-blind clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to examine the possible benefits and harms associated with bicyclol. Bicyclol can only be recommended for use in randomised trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:14:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious liver disease that may cause cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Hepatitis B is endemic in parts of Asia, the South-Pacific region, sub-Saharan Africa, but it is also present in several other populations world-wide. For example, in China and sub-Saharan Africa, hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HBV is one of the leading causes of cancer in men (<LINK REF="REF-Lok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2002</LINK>). World-wide more than one million deaths every year are caused by hepatitis B, and it is estimated that 350 million are chronically (lifelong) infected (<LINK REF="REF-Purcell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purcell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis B virus is transmitted by body fluids, especially blood and serum. Perinatal mother to child transmission occurs frequently. Further, hepatitis B virus infection is prevalent among homosexual men, intravenous drug users, and persons with multiple sex partners.</P>
<P>The virus belongs to the family hepadnavirus (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 1997</LINK>). The HBV genome has four genes that encode the viral DNA-polymerase (pol), envelope protein (env), pre-core protein (pre-core), and protein X (X). The X protein may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2002</LINK>). HBV is replicated inside the hepatocyte nucleus by synthesis of the plus strand HBV DNA and subsequent the viral genome is converted into a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The cccDNA is the template for the replication RNA, which is transcribed into the minus strand HBV DNA. Most antiviral agents that have been examined so far have little or no effect on cccDNA (<LINK REF="REF-Lok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alpha-interferons are presently considered 'standard therapy' for patients with chronic hepatitis B who are hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) positive. Interferon alfa-2b cleared HBsAg from serum in about eight percent of patients compared to one percent for untreated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2002</LINK>). Studies have found lamivudine (3TC) equally effective to interferon alpha in clearing serum HBeAg. Pegylated interferon alfa-2b seems superior to 'standard interferon'. Adding lamivudine to pegylated interferon is not considered beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 2005</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK> study, staggered combination treatment with pegylated interferon alpha-2b and lamivudine may lead to a higher virologic response than lamivudine monotherapy.</P>
<P>Bicyclol is a novel synthetic anti-hepatitis drug that was patented by Liu Gengtao (<LINK REF="REF-NNPP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNPP 2005</LINK>). Experimental studies have shown that bicyclol protects cell membrane through elimination of free radicals. It can protect hepatocyte nuclear DNA from damage and reduce the apoptosis induced by immuno-stimulating compound concanavalin A (Con A). Bicyclol has been claimed to posess hepato-protective and anti-virus effects (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK>). Phase II and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that the elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of most of the patients with chronic hepatitis B became normal and in a proportion of patients both the HBV DNA and HBeAg were cleared during bicyclol treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK>). No obvious adverse events were observed in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>). Based on these data, bicyclol has been approved for clinical use in China (<LINK REF="REF-NNPP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNPP 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have been unable to identify systematic reviews of the evidence on bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review systematically, the evidence on beneficial and harmful effects of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B. </P>

<BR/>Based on the above quality components, studies were to be sub-divided into the following three categories:<BR/>(A) all quality components adequate: low risk of bias.<BR/>(B) one or more of the quality components unclear: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>(C) more components inadequate: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction </B>
<BR/>TW and GL independently extracted data using a data extraction form. We extracted data on study characteristics including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We resolved any disagreements by referring to the trial report and through discussion. If data from the trial reports were insufficient or missing, we contacted the authors for additional information. For binary outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations. Data extraction was undertaken by one author and checked by a second.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis<BR/>
</B>Due to the only one randomised clinical trial included, we could not follow the statistical plan below.</P>
<P>We had expected both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. The relative risk (RR) and control events rates were to have been used for reporting dichotomous data. We intended to calculate the risk difference (RD) and convert the RD into the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) if follow-up time and control event rates are similar for the different trials. Continuous data were to have been expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall results were to have been calculated based on the random-effects model. Heterogeneity were to have been tested for significance set at P &lt; 0.1. Possible sources of heterogeneity were to be assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. Potential bias was to have been tested for using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Subgroup analyses</I>
</B>
<BR/>We aimed at performing subgroup analyses in order to explore effect size difference as follows:<BR/>(1) doses or routes;<BR/>(2) different comparison interventions;<BR/>(3) different stages/duration of disease, depending on data.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sensitivity analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>We aimed at performing sensitivity analyses in order to explore the influence of the following factors on effect size:<BR/>(1) Repeating the analysis, excluding unpublished studies (if there were any).<BR/>(2) Repeating the analysis, taking into account quality, as specified above.<BR/>(3) Repeating the analysis, excluding any trials with long duration or large studies to establish how much they dominate the results.<BR/>(4) Repeat the analysis excluding trials using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other), country.</P>
<P>The robustness of the results will also be tested by repeating the analysis using different measures of effects size (risk difference, odds ratio etc.) and different statistic models (fixed and random effects models).</P>

However, four of these studies were confirmed by the authors to involve non-random allocation, and were subsequently excluded from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Feng 2004</LINK>). Accordingly, one randomised clinical trial met our inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Design<BR/>
</B>The included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>) was a multicentre trial with a parallel-group design.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants<BR/>
</B>A total of 407 patients with chronic hepatitis B were recruited from hospitals in China.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>The intervention group was given tablets of bicyclol at a dosage of 25 mg plus placebo, per time, three times daily, and the control group was given tablets of bifendate at a dosage of 25 mg plus placebo per time, three times a day. The placebo tablet given to the intervention group had the same appearance as bifendate, and the placebo tablet given to the control group had the same appearance as bicyclol. The course of treatment was 24 weeks.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes<BR/>
</B>Normalisation of ALT and AST, and loss of HBeAg and HBV DNA, and seroconversion to anti-HBe were reported. Outcome measurements was carried out respectively, at the end of 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 24th week of the trial, and at 4th, 8th, and 12th week after the end of treatment.</P>

<P>The published report of the included study (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>) did not include any information to assess the methodological quality, but stated that it was conducted following the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidance of the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. After contacting the authors for further information, the study was noted to have used a computer to carry out the random allocation of the participants and that the study investigators and the participants were blinded to the group allocation. Consequently, generation of the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment were assessed as 'adequate'. Intention-to-treat analysis was used in the study. Because of this additional information the trial turned to be of high-quality, ie, low risk of bias (see 'Table 1).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:12:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Our systematic review shows a number of interesting findings in spite of the paucity of data from randomised clinical trials on bicyclol for chronic hepatitis B.</P>
<P>First, we found no randomised trials comparing bicyclol versus placebo or no intervention for patients with chronic hepatitis B. This may be viewed as a positive finding as a number of interventions are considered effective for chronic hepatitis B patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2001</LINK>). However, these interventions mainly affect surrogate outcomes. It may therefore be discussed if bicyclol needs to be compared with interventions already accepted internationally as beneficial for patients with chronic hepatitis B or compared with placebo in so called 'add-on' trials treating both intervention arms with intervention(s) considered beneficial to the patients.</P>
<P>Second, we found no randomised trials comparing bicyclol versus interferon, pegylated interferon, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or other interventions used to treat patients with chronic hepatitis B. Before bicyclol can be recommended for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B, randomised trials with adequate methodology must demonstrate that bicyclol offers similar or better effects than accepted treatments or similar effects and less harmful effects than accepted treatments.</P>
<P>Third, we were only able to identify one randomised trial, in which bicyclol was compared with bifendate (biphenyldicarboxylate). This trial did not show any significant clinical or serological differences between the two interventions. Bicyclol, however, seemed less effective in reducing ALT activity compared with bifendate. The results of comparing bicyclol versus bifendate are hampered by our lack of knowledge about the beneficial and harmful effects of the latter drug. We have only been able to identify one study on bifendate for chronic hepatitis B and it compared the patients with untreated controls (<LINK REF="REF-Cui-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cui 2002</LINK>). It had a 'before-after' study design. The trialists claim that bifendate was significantly better than before no intervention in increasing the proportion converting serum HBeAg to HBeAb, clearing HBV DNA, and decreasing serum ALT activity. This study does not employ blinding. These inadequacies may have biased the results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Before further trials use bifendate as comparator, we need to establish beyond reasonable doubt in several independently conducted randomised trials that bifendate is an effective intervention for patients with chronic hepatitis B.</P>
<P>Fourth, the included trial observed only few patients having adverse effects. Future trials ought to report adverse events according to the International Committee on Harmonization instructions (CFR &amp; ICH 1997) and CONSORT.</P>
<P>Fifth, we caution about the low-bias risk grading of the trial included in our review. The information that the trial was conducted with adequate methodology was not included in the original report of the trial. We have no chance to verify the information that we obtained from personal communication with the authors. Although the trial reported the use of 'double-dummy' placebo, we have no information from the published report about the bicyclol and bifendate tablets being identical in appearance. Furthermore, the trialists did not check the success of blinding or at least have not reported such data.</P>
<P>Sixth, we noticed that a large number of the Chinese trials claimed to be randomised, but when we asked the trialists about the methodology it turned out that these studies were in fact not randomised. This finding is in accordance with previous observations on a large sample of Chinese trials on herbal medicines for chronic hepatitis B, suggesting that there may exist misunderstanding of the concept and misuse of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seventh, we think that bicyclol has been inappropiately early accepted by the National New Products Program in China (<LINK REF="REF-NNPP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNPP 2005</LINK>). The product has simply not been tested sufficiently.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to support or refute the use of bicyclol for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients, nor can we rule out the possibility of harmful effects. Bicyclol should only be used in randomised clinical trials. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>High-quality randomised clinical trials testing bicyclol versus placebo as an 'add-on' intervention or versus interventions with a well-known effect on hepatitis B with long-term follow-up are needed. They ought to follow the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) in their reporting.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Double blind, multicentre study with parallel group design. </P>
<P>The information below was received through personal communication with Prof. Yao by telephone and e-mail.</P>
<P>Generation of the allocation sequence: adequate, use of random number table.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment: adequate, centrally randomised.</P>
<P>Blinding: yes. The health provider and the participants were blinded.</P>
<P>Follow-up: yes.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat: yes.</P>
<P>Sample size calculation: performed. It was determined by a statistician according to SFDA policy.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>407 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 314 males and 93 females, 21to 41 age. The patients had presence of both HBsAg and HBeAg in serum for at least 24 weeks and were HBV-DNA positive. They had high levels of ALT and AST during the past 12 weeks. 269 (M/F: 215/54) were allocated to the bicyclol group and 138 (M/F: 99/39) to the bifendate group.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention group was given tablets of bicyclol at a dosage of 25 mg plus placebo of 25 mg, per time, three times daily, and the control group was given tablets of bifendate at a dosage of 25 mg plus placebo of 25 mg per time, three times a day. </P>
<P>The placebo tablet given to the intervention group had the same appearance as bifendate, and the placebo tablet given to the control group had the same appearance as bicyclol. </P>
<P>The course of treatment was 24 weeks.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>(1) HBV makers: HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBV-DNA.</P>
<P>(2) ALT, AST.<BR/>(a) marked improvement: normalised of ALT and AST;<BR/>(b) improvement: reduced to lower than 1.5 folders of normal level;<BR/>(c) inefficacy: still keep on a high level.</P>
<P>(3) SB (serum bilirubin).</P>
<P>(4) Prothrombin time, serum albumin and globulin, serum creatinine and routine urine examination.</P>
<P>Tests took place before taking the medicine, and in week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 after taking the medicine, and in week 4, 8, 12 after treatment.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>(1) Settings: Shanghai Jinan Medical Center, The first Hospital of Beijing University, Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai Secondary Medical University, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Beijing Youan Hospital, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University;</P>
<P>(2) Design and practicing were followed to the GCP of SFDA (State Food and Drug Administration of China).</P>
<P>(3) The authors mentioned that outcomes were calculated on both intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and per-protocol (P-P) analysis basis, but no detailed information about the method of ITT analysis.</P>
<P>(4) All of the additional information was received by asking authors by telephone (Dr. Ji YY) or e-mail (Prof. Yao GB) in 4 July, 2002, 16 Aug. 2004, 12 March, 2005, 22 July, 2005, and in 26 July, 2005, respectively.</P>
