Thanks to all for a great deal of hard work. I have just tidied up beta-2 and NNTB and NNTH throughout. This is now ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;041105&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby&lt;br&gt;You have done an excellent job with this - congratulations. I have made only minor further changes, mostly where a meaning is unclear or a bracket is missing - done in reviewing mode so changes visible and highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;31/10/05&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Paul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the month-delay in commenting on your Xanthines review. It is well written and authoritative. I did not re-check data, as I am sure Chris did so. These are only editorial comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.Synopsis &lt;br&gt;a.I would remove the sentence starting with 'the design of the studies&amp;#8230;.placebo': it distracts from your message. Furthermore, the more worrisome effect is so much the unblinding (which is hypothetical) but the selection bias that is best addressed in the discussion. &lt;br&gt;2.Abstract&lt;br&gt;a.Selection criteria and results: specify regular short-acting beta-agonists&lt;br&gt;b.Results: last comparison. State that data could not be aggregated.&lt;br&gt;c.Conclusions: very long. &lt;br&gt;i.Remove third sentence &amp;quot;our findings endorse&amp;#8230;xanthines' as you said the same think in the second to last sentence. &lt;br&gt;ii.Remove the sentence ' the use of pre-trial&amp;#8230;side effects.&lt;br&gt;iii.Abbreviate to make your points stronger. &lt;br&gt;d.Description of studies&lt;br&gt;3rd line. Specify what is 'inadequate duration:' too long or too short in relation to entry criteria.&lt;br&gt;i.Study population: &amp;#8230;add: diagnosis confusion with bronchiolitis. &lt;br&gt;ii.Intervention: 2nd para, 2nd line: specify if co-intervention was with oral or inhaled steroid medication&lt;br&gt;iii.Intervention: 3rd para, 2nd line: specify regular SABA, Have you introduced the term SABA before?&lt;br&gt;e.Methodological quality. &lt;br&gt;i.Re: unblinding-&amp;quot; affects internal validity: &lt;br&gt;1.This is hypothetical and may have influence on symptoms and side effects but unlikely to have influence on objective measures such as PEF. &lt;br&gt;2.Was maintenance of blinding measured in any trial? If so or if not, you need to mention it.&lt;br&gt;ii.My perception is that, if anything, the pre-trial phase with open label xanthines is more likely to affect external validity by selecting out (excluding) the patients were less responsive and less tolerant to adverse effects. Next you need to quantify the importance of this bias (by reporting the % of patients excluded prior to randomisation: is it 2% or 20%? You need to qualify the direction of bias on study results: if the hypothesis were true, the impact on study results would be an over-estimation of the true benefits and an underestimation of the adverse effects.&lt;br&gt;iii.3rd para; crossover design studies. Please describe the washout period to support your statement that the design may not have adequately controlled for carry over effect. &lt;br&gt;3.Results.&lt;br&gt;a.General&lt;br&gt;i.Are you reporting fixed effects unless otherwise reported or the opposite? &lt;br&gt;ii.Shouldn't you report the random effect model only when discrepancy between fixed and random effect. The reader won't know which one is the good one. I suggest deleting the fixed effects estimate in those cases.&lt;br&gt;iii.Mention the magnitude of effect in the summary, when you are reporting a + effect.&lt;br&gt;iv.Harmonize how NNTH are reported, (sometimes as NNT) &lt;br&gt;b.I like how you summarize the studies in the results section, at the beginning of each protocol. May I suggest that you &lt;br&gt;i.Add in this summary a description of the control intervention (02: steroids, 04; cromoglycate, 07: add-to to ICS.: mention dose, frequency, etc). &lt;br&gt;ii.For some of the sections, the summary of findings is incomplete or does not reflect perfectly the detailed description. (Particularly for the comparisons 1 and 2,). &lt;br&gt;iii.Add, for positive results, an idea of the magnitude of effect. (Also discuss in the discussion)&lt;br&gt;c.Comparison 1. &lt;br&gt;i.Verify dose of Levene (20 mg/kg) re: reported in weird order in relation to Grass and Bose.&lt;br&gt;ii.Correct summary to match the individual results&lt;br&gt;4.Discussion&lt;br&gt;a.Add idea of the magnitude of effect (RR, % improvement in PFTs, NNT/NNH) for each protocol&lt;br&gt;b.Distinguish the two issues raised by the run-in open phase of xanthines&lt;br&gt;i.Internal validity if unblinding. Discuss if maintenance of blinding assess. If double dummy, presumably the appearance and taste were identical.&lt;br&gt;ii.Discuss the hypothetical direction and magnitude of selection bias. Mention your attempt to prove or disprove hypothesis (reported drop-out rate prior to randomisation). &lt;br&gt;1.Was there any protocol where this was not an issue: re: no trials contributed data with such run-in open label phase? &lt;br&gt;2.Was there any protocol where this was likely an issue?&lt;br&gt;c.2nd to last para; LABA as add-on. You may want to quote Ni Chroinin's review on LABA as add-on to ICS, in addition to Walters 2004.&lt;br&gt;d.Last para: there was 2 RCTs in adults where xanthines was less effective than LABA and LTRA as add-on to ICS&lt;br&gt;i.Dempsey OJ. Chest 2002;122;151-9.&lt;br&gt;ii.My reading of Yurkadul was that the addition of theophylline to ICS was less effective than adding LTRA to ICS for m&amp;#233;thacholine testing and nitric oxide. &lt;br&gt;5.Implications for practice (and discussion: para 9) &lt;br&gt;a.The qualification of asthma severity as: mild and moderately severe paediatric asthma is not clear. Does it mean from mild to severe asthma?&lt;br&gt;6.Implications for research&lt;br&gt;a.Put 1st sentence as a point (it is different from the next 3 bullets)&lt;br&gt;b.Merge 2nd and 3rd para together and add request to monitor unblinding&lt;br&gt;c.Ask for the reporting of primary and secondary outcomes that would permit you to include them in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very good, I don't need to see the next version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;=================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit Sept 29&lt;br&gt;GIV data looks much better on the analyses. Thanks for changing this over. Few very minor changes in red but otherwise this is ready for peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=================================================&lt;br&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;br&gt; I have altered the review as per your comments. This is now available to you on Archie. Lots of versions because I backed everything up whilst it was still checked out to me (belts and braces!) I can delete these of they are confusing. The latest version I have marked for your attention. I have also added text in red throughout the results section where necessary. There were a few rogue P values that could be converted to SEMs, so I took the liberty of doing so. All new outcomes or amended outcomes (i.e. changed because GIV led to different results than before) are in red. Also added an additional table with method of imputations detailed. I put in another para in the methods section with some fleshing out of the method of extracting SD units for GIV outcomes.&lt;br&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing 22 Sept 2005 Oral Xanthines in Asthma&lt;br&gt;This is a huge piece of work and looks a good review. &lt;br&gt;Technical issues for Toby. The P Values for Brenner do not match the paper so the SEM is currently too small. Please adjust to fit. Please could you go through the the crossover studies according to the ground rules I have sent you. The text is generally very sensible in dealing with results but I will edit it properly after the data has been cleaned up.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=================================================================&lt;br&gt;SS section &amp;amp; refs. checked 22/08/05 Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;250504. TJL: Symptom free days - I have re-analysed these data with paired p values for the Pedersen study. This was significant in the published paper, but was not so in the review (SMD outcome 01 01). The GIV outcome is now significant in favour of Xanthine. &lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Strang 1960 data - Lung function all participants readings were given for both periods. I have summed the between patient difference and obtained a pooled SD. Chris is this OK? No stats test was presented, but this seemed the most pragmatic way to treat the data. &lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;February 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Paul,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I must apologize for returning my comments on the oral xanthines review so late. When I first received it in November, I was exchanging emails with Toby regarding the IV xanthines review and didn't realize this was yet another review. I sat on it for 3 months, sure to be up-to-date with my Cochrane editorial tasks&amp;#8230; until Toby enquired about it two weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have last seen this topic as a protocol and am very impressed (and not surprisingly so, given it's from you) with this first draft of the full-text review. I have listed below my comments in two sections and made some minor editorial changes/comments highlighted in red in the text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall/major issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The review is actually a series of small reviews on the topic. It might be worth for the update to split it in two, perhaps looking at it as monotherapy vs. add-on therapy. Leave it like this for now but it is important to restructure the review as a series of reviews for clarity and mostly interpretation purposes. I propose specifically that you describe the characteristics of included studies and their methodology by comparisons, like you have done for the results section. Find a way to do it clearly and briefly. It is critical for the reader to appraise the literature pertaining to each result section as to the type of participants, intensity of intervention and control intervention (e.g., dose) to determine the generalizability of findings.&lt;br&gt;2. Because of the volume of data presented in the results section, it would be very helpful to:&lt;br&gt;a. Start each comparison with a small paragraph briefly summarizing the highlights of these trials in 1 or 2 sentences, e.g. highlighting the number of study/ study design, brief description of participants (eg. Number, age, severity), the intensity (dose, freq) of the active and control interventions, duration.&lt;br&gt;b. Conclude each comparison summarize the findings for each comparison in 1 or 2 sentences, (e.g. highlight the main outcome and findings &amp;#8230;. &amp;quot;No group difference except for &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;) . &lt;br&gt;3. Methodological quality: some of the text pertains to discussion&lt;br&gt;4. Open trial with xanthine prior to randomisation.&lt;br&gt;a. In fact, I think this is the best of two evils. It allowed to maintain blinding which is critical. It needs to be stated very clearly. In fact we want future trials to do this as well, but also to clearly report the % of drop-outs due to poor tolerance, poor adherence to tx, etc. it may very well be that for most trials, very few people drop-out pre-randomisation. Re: risk of unblinding by patients: was this assessed ( did anyone ask the questions to patients: if not, this is a possibility not a fact). I suggest changing the tone to only present the advantages and possible limitation of pre-trial dose adjustment of xanthine and ask for better reporting of drop-outs before trials and of blinding status of patients to gauge the magnitude and direction of a possible bias.&lt;br&gt;Minor issues &lt;br&gt;1. I find &amp;quot;between group comparison&amp;quot; more explicit than 'data set&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;2. Abstract&lt;br&gt;a. selection criteria: specify duration of treatment and setting of recruitment (eg. Not clear if only outpatient or in hospital and ICU)&lt;br&gt;b. data collection: specify main and secondary outcomes&lt;br&gt;c. main results: &lt;br&gt; i. add 1-2 sentences describing the study design, participants (age, baseline severity) tract, xanthine in therapeutic/subtherapeutic dosage&lt;br&gt; ii. for specific interventions, when indicated, specify the dose of control intervention (e.g., dose of ICS and cromoglycate)&lt;br&gt; iii. specify if xanthine vs b2-agonists comparison refers to daily vs prn administration of b2-agonists&lt;br&gt;d. conclusion: I would suggest you summarize the findings rather than making recommendation for use. You could say something like&amp;gt; xanthine is superior to placebo as monotherapy or add-on to ICS. less effective than (?low dose) ICS as monotherapy. No significantly different from cromoglycate and regular b2 agonists in the doses used. Insufficient data to compare to ketotifen. Comment on common side effects (gi and headache)&lt;br&gt;3. background&lt;br&gt;a. update references: NHLBI was republished in 2002, IPACG 1992 is old, re: Canadian adults (Lemiere Can Resp J 2004) - pediatric consensus submitted-&amp;gt;I'll update you when out. [The latest Can recommendations do not discuss xanthine in pediatrics ]&lt;br&gt;b. three trials in adults comparing theophylline as add-on to ICS vs other alternatives; &lt;br&gt; i. Dempsey OJ, Fowler SJ, Wilson A, Kennedy G, Lipworth BJ. Effects of adding either a leukotriene receptor antagonist or low-dose theophylline to a low or medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with persistent asthma. Chest 2002; 122(1):151-159&lt;br&gt; ii. Yurdakul AS, Calisir HC, Tunctan B, Ogretensoy M. Comparison of second controller medications in addition to inhaled corticosteroid in patients with moderate asthma. Respir Med 2002; 96(5):322-329.&lt;br&gt; iii.

N Engl J Med 1997; 337(20):1412-1418.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Criteria&lt;br&gt;a. Participants: it would be useful to have a % of participants less then 18 months in each trial as to situate the trial (and consequently the review) with regards to the possibility of including bronchiolitic patients&lt;br&gt;b. Duration of trials: 28 days is 4 weeks, not 1 month: select one or the other and be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Statistical consideration&lt;br&gt;a. I suggested a re-organisation (see text). &lt;br&gt;b. The third para is still not clear: not sure if you are contrasting data imputation from cross-over vs parallel study or contrasting how you did it for continuous vs categorical data or for different outcomes. Add references for method of imputation. I suggest that you discussed in separate paragraphs (1) the selection of estimates (smd, wmd) and (2) methods of imputation with appropriate ref. &lt;br&gt;c. Why didn't you use RR instead of OR which is a poor estimation of RR in case of frequent events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Description of studies&lt;br&gt; i. EIB and acute asthma were not specified as exclusion criteria&lt;br&gt; ii. See above and text.&lt;br&gt; iii. Spell out SABA before 1st use&lt;br&gt; iv. Any data on atopy?&lt;br&gt; v. Specify info regarding possibility of inclusion of bronchiolitics (% first wheezers? % below specific age cut-off?)&lt;br&gt;7. Methodological quality&lt;br&gt;a. See above in major comments&lt;br&gt;b. Specify issues with cross-over may related to inadequate wash-out period and describe somewhere the presence and duration of these wash-out periods.&lt;br&gt;c. Can you conclude overall on the good vs poor methodological quality as it pertains to each comparisons?&lt;br&gt;8. References &lt;br&gt;a. Caswell (add year of publication in the link)&lt;br&gt;9. Results&lt;br&gt;a. Comparison 01: 8 trials listed for primary outcome vs 7 listed on under 'outcomes' under description of studies: see numbers highlighted in red.&lt;br&gt;b. See above in major comments&lt;br&gt;10. Discussion&lt;br&gt;a. Needs restructuring and elaboration. Not easy given the number of comparisons. I suggest&lt;br&gt; i. 1st para: overall findings for all comparisons when xanthine is used as monotherapy vs add-on therapy. a bit like my suggested conclusion for the abstract. &lt;br&gt; ii. 2nd and subsequent para: address comparisons one by one although you could merge some where data was insufficient. Definitively have one separate to address xanthine vs placebo, vs ics, vs regular saba, vs cromolyn, and as add-on to ics. In each para, emphasis on main outcome with sensitivity analyses (which could or could not be done. Briefly comment on how sec outcomes support or not findings of primary outcome. Interpret findings in relation to characteristics of participants (age, severity), intensity of intervention and co-intervention (dose of ICS, duration of tx, delivery method, serum level of xanthines etc). and methodological quality. Compare findings with other prior review.&lt;br&gt; iii. Add a para on adverse effects&lt;br&gt; iv. Add a para on strengths of review. &lt;br&gt;1. Isn't this review the most comprehensive to date&amp;quot;,confirmation of data. &lt;br&gt;2. Imputed data supported or not the non-imputed analysis.&lt;br&gt;3. For significant differences in primary outcome, assess robustness of finding if possible (can,t use fail safe N test re: no dichotomous). &lt;br&gt; v. Add a para to address difficulties in design. &lt;br&gt;1. address issue of dose adjustment pre-randomisation (advantages re: blinding but possible bias the direction and magnitude of which cannot be clearly assessed re: poor reporting of blinding status of patient + assessors and of drop-out prior and after randomisation).. &lt;br&gt;2. issue of selection (and selection bias) and genealisability of results -&lt;br&gt;3. power. - &lt;br&gt;4. impact of main outcome selection on interpretation-&amp;quot; is % symptom-free days the best? why&lt;br&gt; vi. Highlight the importance of findings for clinicians &lt;br&gt;1. i.e use of cheap xanthine as monotherapy in countries or patients that can't afford other tx, &lt;br&gt;2. Usefulness of head-to-head comparisons with gold standard monotherapy ICS and other monotherapy for clinicians. &lt;br&gt;3. Paucity of data re:other comparisons i.e., monotherapy with LTRA and as add-on therapy to LABA and LTRA. &lt;br&gt;b. Implications.&lt;br&gt; i. Separate use as monotherapy vs add-on therapy. Which conclusions are firm (based on solid data), which are less firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.5&lt;br&gt;TJL: 190404&lt;br&gt;Symptoms - (0109; 0107). One study in outcome 07 (Bose 1987) and two studies for outcome 09 (Glass 1981; Levene 1986) had missing SDs for outcome 09 which was already pooled standardised due to different symptom scales. In order to give a more precise pooled estimate I have calculated average SEMs and calculated their proportion of the means. This gave a percentage which I have converted to a SEM for each mean that has no SD. I have only done so where there are more than 3 studies contributing SDs. Chris would you agree with this? &lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Oral xanthines for maintenance treatment of childhood asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: Oral xanthines for maintenance treatment of childhood asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Oral xanthines as maintenance treatment for asthma in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Oral xanthines as maintenance treatment for asthma in children&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-10-22 15:02:17 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="XAN-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.16" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="5.4">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-15 09:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Xanthines (e.g. theophylline) are a group of drugs thought to have helpful preventative and reliever properties in the treatment of asthma in children. This review of studies has established that there is evidence for useful effects of these drugs in terms of symptom relief and lung function, but also some evidence of side-effects. As a <I>primary preventative therapy</I>, whilst there is evidence that xanthines are effective, this review suggests that more effective alternative treatment options (inhaled steroids) are available. In children with more severe asthma, the role of xanthines as an <I>add-on therapy</I> has only been assessed in a small number of trials, which report mixed effects. More studies in this area would help to generate a more reliable overview of the effects of treatment in these children. Xanthines are an effective preventative treatment in childhood asthma, but less effective than inhaled steroids, and with a less favourable side-effect profile. There is insufficient evidence at present to assess their role as "add-on" preventer treatment versus newer alternatives. Some of the trials exposed the children they recruited to a pre-trial phase of xanthine in order to maintain effective dosing during the trial. This could have made the trial participants less representative of the general population by making them more inclined to tolerate the study drug. This exposure also may have meant that they could recognise what drug they were taking during the blinded phase of the study. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-15 09:37:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Xanthines as first-line preventer alleviate symptoms and reduce requirement for rescue medication in children with mild to moderate asthma. When compared with ICS they were less effective in preventing exacerbations. Xanthines had similar efficacy as single preventative agent compared with regular SABA and SCG. Evidence on AEs (adverse effects) was equivocal: there was evidence for increased AEs overall, but no evidence that any specific AE (including effects on behaviour and attention) occurred more frequently than with placebo. There is insufficient evidence from available studies to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of xanthines as add-on preventative treatment to ICS, and there are no published paediatric studies comparing xanthines with alternatives in this role. Our data suggest that xanthines are only suitable as first-line preventative asthma therapy in children when ICS are not available. Pre-trial exposure to the agents assessed may have pre-disposed the trial populations to tolerate the drug, and may have threatened blinding. They may have a role as add-on therapy in more severe asthma not controlled by ICS, but further studies are needed to examine this, and to define the risk-benefit ratio compared with other agents.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-22 14:48:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Xanthines, such as theophylline and aminophylline, have been used as bronchodilators for many years in the treatment of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Hermann-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermann 1937</LINK>). A number of controlled clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of xanthines as bronchodilators (<LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1974</LINK>), but side-effects have been a concern (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1993</LINK>). With the recognition of inflammation in the pathogenesis of asthma, use of theophyllines has declined in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Vassallo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vassallo 1998</LINK>). Aggressive treatment of airway inflammation with agents such as inhaled steroids is now recommended by consensus statements on asthma (<LINK REF="REF-IPACG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPACG 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). Such statements recommend theophyllines only as 'add-on' treatment when control is not achieved by inhaled steroids, and increasingly as second or third choice in this role (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, interest in xanthines has been reawakened by evidence suggesting a mild anti-inflammatory, as well as bronchodilator, effect of these drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 1989</LINK>), though whether this is clinically relevant remains controversial. Although adult studies have provided good evidence for long-acting beta-agonists as first choice 'add-on' treatment to inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Greening-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greening 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ind-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ind 2003</LINK>), evidence for this in children is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Verberne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verberne 1998</LINK>), and there have been no direct comparisons with xanthines or leukotriene antagonists in paediatrics. Worldwide, particularly in developing countries where cost and availability are major issues, xanthines are potentially even more important (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2003</LINK>). A review of the literature summarizing the evidence regarding the use of xanthines in the maintenance treatment of childhood asthma is warranted.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the efficacy of oral xanthines as maintenance treatment of chronic childhood asthma. Use of intravenous aminophylline in acute asthma was not included. </P>
<P>The specific questions to be answered were:<BR/>1. Is xanthine as maintenance therapy effective in improving asthma control as compared to placebo, beta-agonist, inhaled corticosteroid, ketotifen, cromoglycate or leukotriene antagonists?<BR/>2. Does the use of xanthine result in an excess of adverse effects compared with placebo or the alternative maintenance therapies?</P>
<P>Two separate treatment comparisons were made:<BR/>1. Use of xanthine as a single agent<BR/>2. Use of xanthine as 'add-on' treatment to inhaled corticosteroids (i.e. with inhaled corticosteroids as a co-intervention)</P>

<P>Because of incomplete reporting, we imputed some of the missing data to allow inclusion of trials and to assess the sensitivity of our results with and without imputed data.

We imputed SEMs for GIV data where no P value was reported, by calculating a mean difference and 95% CI based upon published SDs or SEMs for the two groups. Whilst this does not replace calculations based upon P values or raw data, these treatment effect estimates are provided by studies which did not provide a P value because they did not report a significant difference.

<P>Data for parallel group trials are expressed as a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We pooled data from crossover studies with generic inverse variance (GIV, see <LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2008</LINK>). We used the mean differences and estimated the standard errors (SEM) based upon the published P value, or from 95% confidence intervals if available. Where these were not available, we used the published SDs for the two groups to derive a SEM. For continuous data variables (e.g. lung function) a mean difference (MD) was calculated by pooling data where a common metric was used. A standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated where studies had measured the same outcome but with different metrics (e.g. for pooling data from different symptom scores). For GIV outcomes reporting SD units, we have expressed effect sizes in terms of the pooled standard deviation for each study (e.g. where the effect size for a given study is 0.5, this represents a mean difference between the treatment and control groups of half a pooled standard deviation as reported in that study).</P>
<P>For dichotomous variables (e.g. admission to hospital), an odds ratio (OR) was calculated based on the event rate data in the studies. Relative risks were also calculated as these are easier to interpret clinically. Where there were significant differences in both odds and risks, a number-needed-to-treat (benefit)((NNTB) and number-needed-to-treat (harm) (NNTH) was calculated using an online statistical package (Visual Rx - www.nntonline.net).</P>

<P>No significant difference between xanthine and SCG: four studies, mean difference -1.27% [-6.64, 4.10], N = 97. There was a high level of heterogeneity (80.9%). This resolved partially when <LINK REF="STD-Hambleton-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hambleton 1977</LINK> was removed from the analysis. This resulted in a significant difference in favour of SCG of -7.88% [-14.47, -1.29] (I<SUP>2</SUP> 52.7%). The principal difference between <LINK REF="STD-Hambleton-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hambleton 1977</LINK> and the other studies was that participants were included if they were tolerant of xanthine at baseline. Whilst xanthines had been taken by varying proportions in the remaining studies prior to study entry, <LINK REF="STD-Hambleton-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hambleton 1977</LINK> recruited a tolerant and therefore a potentially more biased sample of children.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-15 10:21:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We have assembled evidence from 36 studies, recruiting a total of 2838 participants with varying severities of asthma in studies conducted between 1960 and 2006.</P>
<P>The studies fall into two distinct categories from a therapeutic point of view: those in which use of xanthines as a <I>primary preventer</I> were examined (Comparisons 01 to 05) and those in which xanthines as <I>add-on preventer </I>(to steroids) were examined (Comparison 06). In summary, as primary preventer there was evidence of clear benefit in terms of symptoms and lung function, with some inconclusive evidence of side-effects. However, xanthines as primary preventer were less effective than inhaled steroids. As an additional preventer to inhaled and/or oral steroids, no firm conclusions could be reached.</P>
<P>The studies comparing xanthines with placebo in children (comparison 01, 17 studies) showed clear evidence of benefit on the primary outcome measure, symptom-free days, and on a variety of the secondary outcome<B> </B>measures, including night symptom scores, rescue beta-2 agonist use, and lung function. The size of these effects was in the order of 8-13% fewer days/nights without symptoms, 5% predicted am PEF and 4% predicted pm PEF. There was evidence of increased side-effects overall compared to placebo (NNTH 5), but no significant increase in the incidence of any specific side-effect, whether headache, gastrointestinal disturbance or psychomotor performance. Our findings are in agreement with a previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1996</LINK>), which found little evidence of behavioral and cognitive effects of theophylline and caffeine in therapeutic doses.</P>
<P>Only two studies compared xanthines with inhaled steroids specifically in children (Comparison 02), neither reporting data for symptom-free days. Inhaled steroids were more effective than xanthine in preventing exacerbations (NNTH 10) and more tolerable in terms of nausea (NNTH 8) and headache (NNTH 8). No significant differences were observed in lung function or rescue medication usage.</P>
<P>Ten studies compared xanthine with regular short-acting beta-2 agonist (Comparison 03). A variety of beta-2 agonists, oral and inhaled, beta-2 specific and non-specific were used as the comparator in individual studies. No data for symptom-free days could be pooled. Symptom scores and rescue beta-2 agonist use did not differ significantly between xanthine and beta-2 agonists, although hospitalisations were less frequent in participants treated with short-acting beta-2 agonist (NNTH 7). Headache was more frequent with xanthine (NNTH 5), but tremor was less frequent with xanthine (NNTB 4).</P>
<P>Six studies compared xanthine with sodium cromoglycate (Comparison 04). There was no significant difference in symptom free days, symptom scores, rescue beta-2 agonist use or exacerbations. There were fewer gastrointestinal side effects in children given sodium cromoglycate (NNTH 6).</P>
<P>Only one study compared xanthine with ketotifen, and did not report statistical assessment of outcomes.</P>
<P>For xanthines as add-on preventer to inhaled steroids, we identified two comparisons for which we found studies: placebo (comparison 06; three studies) and LTRAs (comparison 07; one study). Due to divergent outcome measures or lack of sufficient numbers of studies, no data from these comparisons were suitable for meta-analysis. The two studies which included more severe, oral steroid dependent patients showed some clinical benefit from adding in xanthine compared with placebo, while the study with milder patients did not. The findings of the study comparing xanthine and LTRA were inconclusive, with statistical testing being reported for change from baseline scores, whilst numerical data were presented for end of treatment values (<LINK REF="STD-Kondo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kondo 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Assessing the external validity of the assembled evidence is limited by two key aspects of the trials and their presentation. Firstly, ascertaining baseline severity of asthma was hampered by infrequent reporting of baseline lung function assessment. Many of these studies were conducted before inhaled steroids were commonly recommended, and so using pre-trial inhaled steroid consumption as a proxy for severity was not reliable. Based on the available characteristics in the studies, such as symptom frequency, requirement for preventer/reliever medication and the trialists own designation of asthma severity, the majority of children in the included studies had mild to moderately severe asthma.<BR/>
<BR/>Secondly, in 17 of the studies there was a pre-study phase in which xanthine was administered to children in an open label fashion, in order to measure blood levels and establish an individualised therapeutic dose. This strategy has the advantages of ensuring that a therapeutic blood level is achieved, while maintaining blinding during the study proper (otherwise measurement of blood levels and dose adjustment would un-blind those in the active limb). However, there are two theoretical disadvantages. Firstly, if children experience mild side-effects which they then recognise later during the study proper, this could itself threaten blinding. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it may alter the characteristics of the study population (because children who tolerate xanthines poorly may drop out at this pre-study phase), making the study results more difficult to generalise to asthmatic children as a whole. <LINK REF="STD-Hambleton-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hambleton 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pollard-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pollard 1997</LINK> reported attrition rates of 16, 27 and 11% respectively following pre-trial drug exposure phases. Other studies reviewed did not report the drop-out rate during the pre-study phase. It is important for any future studies to document the drop-out rate during any pre-study dose assessment phase and the reasons for this, in order for the importance of this effect to be assessed. Once entered in crossover studies participants who do not complete are unlikely to contribute efficacy data if they do not register any values for the second treatment arm. Where the treatment in question is associated with side-effects, the exclusion of the data for these participants may restrict the generalisability of the treatment populations further, and underestimate the likelihood of side-effects occurring on treatment.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, with these caveats, our analysis suggests that xanthines are of benefit in the treatment of chronic mild to moderate asthma symptoms in children treated for at least four weeks, provided an effective dose of the drug can be achieved without intolerable side effects. The improvements in lung function are large enough to be clinically relevant. These effects are recorded in studies in which the xanthine was the only prophylactic agent used. In the last 30 years, a number of alternative prophylactic agents have been introduced and shown to confer benefit as front line or additive therapy, including inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>), long-acting beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>), and leukotriene receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2004</LINK>). Where economic factors limit the access to these newer agents, our findings suggest that xanthines remain a useful and cost-effective option as sole prophylactic agent. Where newer agents are available, the place of xanthines is less clear. Comparison 02 suggests that xanthines are less effective than inhaled corticosteroids, and supports current guidelines which recommend ICS as the first choice prophylactic agent in symptomatic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In steroid-treated asthma where xanthines have been assessed as an additional therapy to corticosteroid treatment, the evidence base is lacking and the few studies that have been conducted to date have reported discrepant effects. The reasons for this may extend beyond purely methodological issues (i.e. sample size, design and duration of studies), but could also encompass baseline severity of the participants and the potency of concomitant steroid therapy given in the studies. Two studies in adults have suggested that adding theophylline to ICS produces similar benefit to doubling ICS (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1997</LINK>).<B> </B>Without pooled estimates for this population of children with asthma, exploration of clinical characteristics remains a narrative exercise and as such reinforces the need for further research in this area.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-15 11:39:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In children who are able to tolerate the potential side-effects of this class of drugs, xanthines given at a therapeutically active dose confer benefit in terms of alleviating symptoms and reducing the requirement for rescue medication in mild and moderate paediatric asthma. However, this review also endorses the view currently held by clinical guidelines that ICS are a more effective first line therapy, as we have found evidence to indicate that ICS lead to fewer exacerbations compared with xanthines. We were unable to find hard evidence to endorse the widely held view that xanthines have an adverse effect on behaviour in children. However, we do not exclude this possible side-effect and we recommend that children who are given the drug be monitored carefully for adverse effects.</P>
<P>In more<B> </B>severe, steroid-dependent asthma the effects of xanthines as an additional therapy (to inhaled and/or oral steroids)<B> </B>have been explored in only a handful of small studies. A narrative synthesis of the trials in this area reveals equivocal effects and further studies would help to establish whether some of the clinically relevant effects reported in the studies are repeatable and consistent. In some parts of the world, xanthines may be more readily available than other therapies, and whilst we do not recommend xanthines above such therapies as inhaled steroids, they may provide a treatment option that will help improve asthma control in their absence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-15 11:44:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Future studies should aim to clarify the role of xanthines in the context of first-line preventer treatment, with comparison against inhaled steroids in order to assess the relative effects of xanthines and steroids on symptoms. Several small trials have been performed which compare xanthines with other agents in addition to inhaled steroids. Further work which makes similar comparisons would benefit our understanding of the role of xanthines in second line treatment of asthma in children. </P>
