<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-12-18 13:57:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Patients with symptomatic occlusion (obstruction) of the carotid artery have a high risk of subsequent stroke. Anticoagulant treatment and antiplatelet agents are not very effective in these patients and a surgical procedure known as extracranial-intracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass surgery has been a treatment option. In this review, we included 21 trials (two randomised controlled trials and 19 non-random studies, with a total of 2591 patients). We found that EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease was no better or worse than medical care alone. A multi-centre trial comparing EC/IC bypass surgery with best medical treatment in patients with both a high risk of stroke and haemodynamic compromise (impaired blood flow) is underway, and aims to discover whether EC/IC bypass surgery is beneficial in this specific group of patients.</P>

<P>The EC/IC Bypass Study Group found no benefit of extracranial to intracranial (EC/IC) bypass surgery over medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion (sCAO).

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2009). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2009). We also searched ongoing trials and research registers, checked reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted colleagues, trial authors and researchers.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-12-18 13:55:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 21 trials, including two RCTs, involving 2591 patients. For all endpoints, no benefit of EC/IC bypass surgery was shown either in the RCTs (any death: odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11; stroke: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, P = 0.91; death and dependency: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21, P = 0.64), or in the non-RCTs (any death: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62, P = 0.99; stroke: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.18, P = 0.25; death and dependency: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29, P = 0.37).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-12-18 13:56:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with sCAO disease was neither superior nor inferior to medical care alone. However, most studies included patients irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. Participation in an ongoing RCT, which is restricted to patients with impaired haemodynamics, is recommended as these patients might benefit from bypass surgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-12-18 13:59:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Up to 15% of patients presenting with anterior circulation ischaemia have complete occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery (<LINK REF="REF-Bozzao-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozzao 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pessin-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pessin 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiele-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiele 1980</LINK>). Their annual risk for subsequent stroke is 5% to 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Grubb-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grubb 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klijn 1997</LINK>), and the risk of stroke ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery is 2% to 6% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Hankey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klijn 1997</LINK>). The efficacy of anticoagulant treatment or antiplatelet agents in patients with symptomatic occlusion of the carotid artery is small (<LINK REF="REF-Klijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klijn 1997</LINK>). Cerebral revascularisation of the anterior or posterior circulation by extracranial to intracranial (EC/IC) anastomosis is thought to be a therapeutic option for preventing subsequent transient ischaemic attack or stroke in patients with occlusive carotid disease.</P>
<P>EC/IC bypass surgery is an operative procedure which most commonly involves the anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery. Results of the first EC/IC bypass were published in 1967 (<LINK REF="REF-Donaghy-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaghy 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yasargil-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasargil 1969</LINK>) and it became a widespread method in the next decade. In 1985, the EC/IC Bypass Study Group showed no benefit of EC/IC bypass surgery over medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion (<LINK REF="STD-EC_x002f_IC-Bypass-Study-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EC/IC Bypass Study 1985</LINK>). However, the study was criticised for including all patients with occlusion of the carotid artery irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. No stratification was done to separate patients with embolic stroke but sufficient intracranial haemodynamics from those with ongoing haemodynamic compromise. Thus, the negative result of the EC/IC bypass study does not necessarily mean that EC/IC bypass is not beneficial for some patients with substantial haemodynamic compromise due to occlusion of the carotid artery (<LINK REF="REF-Ausman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ausman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Day-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sundt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vorstrup-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorstrup 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Haemodynamic compromise of ipsilateral artery occlusion is divided into three stages (<LINK REF="REF-Derdeyn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derdeyn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 1991</LINK>):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stage 0: normal cerebral haemodynamics;</LI>
<LI>Stage 1: autoregulatory vasodilation;</LI>
<LI>Stage 2: autoregulatory failure (increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)), also termed 'misery perfusion' (<LINK REF="REF-Baron-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1981</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Several studies have been carried out to evaluate whether the subgroup of patients with haemodynamic compromise due to occlusion of the carotid artery might benefit from bypass surgery. In addition, more recently there have been two other randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of EC/IC bypass (<LINK REF="STD-COSS" TYPE="STUDY">COSS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>). With these considerations in mind, we tried to evaluate whether EC/IC bypass surgery plus best medical treatment compared with best medical treatment alone prevents subsequent stroke, improves cerebral haemodynamics and reduces dependency after stroke in all eligible patients for EC/IC bypass or only in patients with impaired haemodynamics.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-12-18 13:59:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The objective was to determine whether bypass surgery and medical care in patients with a symptomatic carotid artery occlusion was superior to medical care alone, both in all patients and in the subgroup of patients with haemodynamic compromise.</P>
<P>A further purpose of this review was to determine to what degree the intervention resulted in the correction of haemodynamic compromise in the affected hemisphere.</P>
<P>Finally we aimed to assess safety: death (all causes, vascular, non-vascular) and stroke (all); intracranial haemorrhage; major extracranial haemorrhage; myocardial infarction; non-vascular complication of surgery; and infection.</P>

<P>Patients with symptomatic (transient ischaemic attack or stroke) occlusion of internal carotid arteries demonstrated by angiography and less than 50% stenosis of the contralateral internal carotid artery and, where available, measured haemodynamic compromise identified by PET, SPECT, PMR imaging and ultrasound. Patients with transient ischaemic monocular blindness were not eligible unless hemispheric symptoms also were present. Patients with asymptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery were not eligible because of the low risk of subsequent ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Powers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients who had undergone thrombendarterectomy of the contralateral internal carotid artery prior to EC/IC bypass were eligible. We excluded all studies including patients with non-atherosclerotic conditions causing or likely to cause cerebral ischaemia (including carotid dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, Moyamoya disease, arteritis and other vasculopathy likely to cause cerebral events) from the analysis. If this information was not available, we only used the published data.</P>

<LI>Death or dependency at the end of follow up. This composite outcome included all patients who qualified either for death or dependency (handicap) which was defined according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS): independency (mRS 0 to 2) was distinguished from dependency (3 to 5). If the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used, we considered good recovery and moderate disability as surrogates for independence, and considered severe disability and persistent vegetative state as dependence. When mRS values were not available, we defined independence as recovery (that is, patients are able to look after their own affairs without assistance) or return to work. In cases of 'deterioration', 'worsened', 'fair' or 'poor' outcome, we assumed dependency as 'partial improvement', 'no improvement', 'no recovery', 'inability to walk without assistance', or 'requiring some help for bodily activities of daily living'. This algorithm was also used for the Cochrane Review of carotid artery dissection (<LINK REF="REF-Lyrer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyrer 2003</LINK>).</LI>

<P>We have identified a total of two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EC/IC bypass and best medical treatment with medical care alone and fulfilling the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-EC_x002f_IC-Bypass-Study-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EC/IC Bypass Study 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>). One RCT is still in progress (<LINK REF="STD-COSS" TYPE="STUDY">COSS</LINK>). For Part 1a, we found a total of 1691 patients, whereas for Part 1b we only included data for 195 patients from the JET study (<LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>). Length of follow up in the EC/IC bypass study was 55.8 months, and in the JET study was 25 months. We identified 118 drop-outs in the EC/IC bypass study, whereas in the JET study 10 patients dropped out. Furthermore, detailed patient data were only given as percentages in the EC/IC bypass study, thus we had to translate these percentages into patient numbers, a procedure which is only approximate (our efforts to get absolute numbers for all necessary outcome variables by contacting the investigators were unsuccessful). In the EC/IC bypass study, only 78% of all randomised patients had a brain CT. In Part 1b, haemodynamic compromise was determined by measuring quantitatively cerebral blood flow using PET, SPECT and the Xenon inhalation method in the JET study.</P>
<P>For Part 2a, we identified 19 non-randomised trials (900 patients), which reported at least one primary outcome variable. Part 2b included three studies, involving 65 patients. The methods of measuring haemodynamic compromise as a selection criteria for EC/IC bypass varied widely: PET study (<LINK REF="STD-Ishikawa--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ishikawa 1992</LINK>), acetazolamide test (<LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1992</LINK>) and Xenon/CT cerebral blood flow measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Yonas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yonas 1996</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Death from all causes</HEADING>
<P>We obtained data from two included trials for 1691 participants. The EC/IC bypass study had a trend towards fewer fatal outcome events in the group who had EC/IC bypass surgery than in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-EC_x002f_IC-Bypass-Study-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EC/IC Bypass Study 1985</LINK>). In the JET study, death from all causes as an outcome event was uncommon and similar in the EC/IC bypass group (two events) to the group with best medical treatment only (one event) (<LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>). Across both studies we observed no significant difference between treatment and control groups regarding death from all causes (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-12-18 14:01:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We identified 21 trials (including two RCTs) involving 2591 patients. For all primary endpoints, neither benefit nor harm from EC/IC bypass surgery could be shown either in the RCTs ('any death': OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11; 'stroke': OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, P = 0.91; 'death and dependency': OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21, P = 0.64), or in the non-RCTs ('any death': OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62, P = 0.99; 'stroke': OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.18, P = 0.25; 'death and dependency': OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29, P = 0.37). One possible explanation for these neutral results was the inclusion in most studies of patients with occlusion of the carotid artery irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. No stratification was done to separate patients with embolic stroke but sufficient intracranial haemodynamics from those with ongoing haemodynamic compromise. After the data analysis of studies selecting patients for EC/IC bypass without measurement of haemodynamic compromise, it still remained unclear whether EC/IC bypass was beneficial or not for some patients with substantial haemodynamic compromise due to occlusion of the carotid artery (<LINK REF="REF-Ausman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ausman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Day-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sundt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vorstrup-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorstrup 1992</LINK>). In order to address this question, we carried out a sub-analysis of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (Part 1b) and of the non-RCTs (Part 2b). For the RCTs, only the JET study had randomised patients with haemodynamic compromise for EC/IC bypass surgery (<LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>). However, this study did not compare surgically treated patients showing haemodynamic compromise with those with normal or almost normal haemodynamics. Of the non-RCTs, only three studies qualified for Part 2b. However, there were very few endpoints, preventing meaningful analysis. In summary, neither the RCTs nor the non-RCTs showed a benefit of EC/IC bypass, probably because haemodynamic compromise was not taken into account in most cases.</P>
<P>The findings about normalisation of impaired haemodynamics across the non-RCTs confirms that EC/IC bypass is effective in restoring normal haemodynamics (<LINK REF="STD-Yonas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yonas 1996</LINK>). However, whether this surrogate marker translates into a clinical benefit is unproven. The fact that the JET trial (<LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>) failed to show a clinical benefit for the primary outcomes ('death from all causes' or 'any stroke') prompts scepticism as to whether the criteria 'impaired haemodynamics' is clinically important enough to predict a potentially beneficial effect of EC/IC bypass surgery. In addition, the best method of determining the presence or absence of impaired haemodynamics remains to be established and the variability between methods used to determine haemodynamic compromise has yet to be defined. The ongoing COSS trial, which uses a more sophisticated measure of impaired haemodynamics, may give clearer answers (<LINK REF="STD-COSS" TYPE="STUDY">COSS</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a limitation, only two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-EC_x002f_IC-Bypass-Study-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EC/IC Bypass Study 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-JET--2006" TYPE="STUDY">JET 2006</LINK>) have been identified for this meta-analysis. Furthermore, the inclusion criteria of both RCTs differ, thus a meta-analysis across both studies could produce misleading conclusions. Potential benefit or harm cannot be excluded definitively. For the non-RCTs, the most important limitation is the non-randomised treatment allocation, which involves a high risk of bias. In addition, the majority of studies available for this meta-analysis were single group reports of small numbers of participants without sub-stratification by haemodynamic compromise. In the studies reported, only 255 of 2591 patients (9.8%) had pre-operative assessments of cerebral haemodynamics, while 2336 of 2591 patients (90.2%) did not. Even fewer data were available comparing pre and post-operative measurements with clinical outcome parameters. Overall the quality of most studies was poor.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-12-18 14:01:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>EC/IC-bypass surgery in patients with a symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease was neither superior nor inferior to medical care alone. Thus, the role of EC/IC bypass surgery in symptomatic carotid disease remains undetermined. However, most studies included patients irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. Patients currently being submitted for EC/IC bypass procedures need protocol-driven assessment delivered by multi-disciplinary teams. Participation in an ongoing randomised controlled trial (RCT), which is restricted to patients with impaired haemodynamics, is recommended as these patients might benefit from bypass surgery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-12-18 14:02:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The optimum bypass has yet to be determined and whether a branch of the superficial temporal artery is sufficient in all cases to reverse the degree of measured haemodynamic compromise and provide a measurable clinical benefit is unknown. In addition, establishing a reliable, widely accessible and cost-effective method of assessing impaired cerebral haemodynamics is of paramount importance.</P>
<P>The data suggest the necessity of a multicentre, prospective RCT comparing EC/IC bypass with the best medical treatment in a selected subgroup of patients at high risk of stroke and with identified haemodynamic compromise. One such study is still ongoing; it remains to be seen whether measuring haemodynamic compromise will help to determine whether patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease benefit from EC/IC bypass surgery. Establishing the safety, efficacy and benefit of surgical bypass can only be established by the future use of multicentre RCTs.</P>
