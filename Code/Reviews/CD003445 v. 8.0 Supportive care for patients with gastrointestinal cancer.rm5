<P>Certain forms of chemotherapy plus supportive care improve both survival and quality of life in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers compared to supportive care alone. Gastrointestinal cancer is the second most common form of cancer and is associated with a high mortality.

<P>This review is an update of a previously published update review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2006) on this topic. No new studies have been identified from the update search and the conclusions are not altered. Supportive care has traditionally been given to optimise the comfort of patients and their ability to function, as well as to minimise the side-effects of anti-cancer treatments. However, the scope of modern comprehensive supportive care is broadening and covers not only specific palliative treatment but non-tumour specific treatment such as social, psychological and spiritual support. In oncology, best supportive care (BSC) has been used as a comparator arm of randomised controlled trials in chemotherapy. However, the BSC arm is usually not well defined and its evaluation is therefore difficult because of the heterogeneity of the definitions. A systematic review was undertaken of the evidence from all RCTs of gastrointestinal cancers (includes gastrointestinal/gastric, colorectal/colon cancer but excludes pancreatic cancer trials) which include a BSC/SC arm.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:29:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the results show that for most of the studies included in this review, certain forms of chemotherapy plus supportive care improve both survival and quality of life in patients with gastrointestinal cancer (gastric and colorectal cancers) compared to receiving supportive care alone. Trials involving BSC/SC in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer require careful evaluation. Oncologists and researchers alike should strive for improvements in trial design and reporting. Future trials should focus on clearer definitions of supportive care. The EORTC definition of supportive care can be used as a guide. BSC/SC trials should use standardised validated outcome measures for symptom control, quality of life, toxicity and other useful palliative measures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:31:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of the same previously published update review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2006) on 'Supportive care for patients with gastrointestinal cancer'. It has been estimated that of the 50 million annual deaths world-wide, about 10% are due to cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that in 1996 more than seven million people died of cancer. Most were cancers of the lung (1.16 million) and stomach (0.85 million) (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmedzai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmedzai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Gastrointestinal tumours including colorectal cancers are one of the commonest causes of cancer deaths in Western countries. Only a small number of patients present in an early stage of disease and the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal tumours is far from satisfactory (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since 1988 there has been an increasing use of the terms 'Best Supportive Care' or 'Supportive Care' as a comparative arm of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 2001</LINK>). The term was first used by the authors of the National Cancer Institute of Canada in a three-arm trial which involved a control arm comparing two chemotherapy regimens with no chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Rapp-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapp 1988</LINK>). In oncology research, anticancer treatment arms are typically well defined and tightly prescribed. However, the best supportive care arm is usually not well defined and therefore may be left open to local interpretation, which questions the validity of these trials. In practice the term BSC/SC implies standard non-interventional care in the same cancer services.</P>
<P>Oncology services are becoming increasingly standardised across Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmedzai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmedzai 2001</LINK>), however, supportive care and palliative care are relatively new clinical developments which may vary significantly between countries. This lack of definition and non-uniformity of best supportive care undermines the scientific basis of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). Furthermore, it is also probably unfair to best supportive care as a therapeutic option, which could be as effective for symptom palliation as the oncological intervention in a number of trials, at least in some centres and countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmedzai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmedzai 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several issues that contribute to the uncertainty regarding best supportive care which need to be addressed. What is meant by 'support'; why 'best'; what is it better than; who is supposed to give the support? In the past supportive care for cancer has tended to focus on anti-emetics, antibiotics and anti-fungals, growth factors, etc. These are indeed 'supportive' in the sense that these interventions are not designed to cure the underlying cancer, but they are mostly addressing the toxicities of anti-cancer therapies.</P>
<P>Ideally supportive care should be aimed at supporting the patient and, where appropriate, the patient's family and carers. The cause of the problems which face the people with cancer may not be their prime concern. What matters is whether their problems can be dealt with, so that anti-cancer therapy can be pursued as far as possible, and that palliative treatments can also be made available whenever they are needed. These are reasonable requests from cancer patients but, at least in the context of clinical trials, how can these interventions under the heading of 'supportive care' be described and defined?</P>
<P>To clarify what is meant by best supportive care, it is helpful to consider whether the purposes of supportive care are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>to give more intensive and effective anti-cancer therapy?</LI>
<LI>to improve quality of life for patients with cancer?</LI>
</OL>
<P>If the primary purpose of best supportive care is (1), then at least the measures which should be made available must be defined, listed in protocols. Some means should be identified to ensure that patients receive these supportive care interventions, and that they are recorded in the case report forms. Otherwise it will not be clear, for example, if the reduction in emesis associated with a chemotherapy regimen is due to a smaller inherent emetic potential of the drugs, or because some of the centres were using better anti-emetic regimens. Documentation about supportive care interventions should be done to the same high standard as the other variables collected in clinical trials e.g. Good Clinical Practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmedzai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmedzai 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>If the aims of best supportive care include (2), then it is crucial that a broader view is taken of what comprises 'support', and, furthermore, this aim could clearly have implications for the care of cancer patients outside of clinical trials. Consequently, it is regarded as unduly narrow to think of supportive care in the context of cancer clinical trials without considering the overall picture of cancer services delivery and the provision of palliative care services.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This was a re-visit of the literature and the original objectives were to systematically review the evidence from all RCTs of gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers (excluding pancreatic and other cancers of the biliary tract) which include a BSC/SC arm in order to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>examine the effectiveness/outcomes of best supportive care interventions versus cancer therapies for gastrointestinal cancer trials;</LI>
<LI>determine whether trials containing best supportive care include a definition of this.</LI>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>To be considered for inclusion, clinical studies had to be RCTs of interventions for gastrointestinal cancer which have a BSC/SC arm. Trials which included both gastrointestinal and pancreatic/biliary cancer patients were included, however, data from the gastrointestinal cancer patients only was undertaken. Studies also had to include at least one of the following outcome parameters: symptom control, pain relief, or quality of life. Trials reporting data from patients with pancreatic and biliary cancers only were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients of 18 years and over who were diagnosed with and treated for cancer of the stomach, gastrointestinal/gastric, or colorectal/colon cancer in any health care setting (in the community; hospital; nursing homes or chronic care institutions; outpatients). </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The types of interventions included in the review were: 1) chemotherapy (any type of chemotherapy for any duration); radiotherapy; surgery; and 2) BSC/SC. The EORTC definition of supportive care was used as a 'gold standard' for the inclusion of studies. However other trials which do not meet this 'gold standard' were also included provided they met the other inclusion criteria stated. These were separated in the sub-group analysis and the results compared.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:31:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All patient outcomes were considered and reflected the outcomes that are most important for patients. However, outcomes may be different if patients are having 'curative' treatment rather than palliation of symptoms. For patients who are terminally ill, quality of life, symptom control and pain relief are of primary concern, whilst those who are undergoing curative treatment, tumour response, improvement and adverse effects are of primary concern. We focused on the following outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>symptom control,</LI>
<LI>pain severity and pain relief,</LI>
<LI>quality of life,</LI>
<LI>any reported adverse side effects,</LI>
<LI>hospitalisation due to adverse effects,</LI>
<LI>length of improvement,</LI>
<LI>length of survival,</LI>
<LI>disease progression.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Validated methods for measuring pain relief</HEADING>
<P>Three general types of pain measurement scales have proven to be useful in a variety of clinical and research settings: categorical scales; visual analogue scales (VAS); and numeric scales (<LINK REF="REF-Osoba-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osoba 1991</LINK>). Data were collected for pain outcomes assessed using any of these scales.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Validated methods for measuring quality of life</HEADING>
<P>The most widely used, standardised, validated methods of measuring quality of life are: the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1993</LINK>); the Quality-of-Life Index (QLI); the Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC), the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT). Quality of life measures using any of these scales and other published scales were accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Staquet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staquet 1998</LINK>). By restricting the number of quality of life and symptom scales it is possible to make valid comparisons between the studies on subjective outcomes.</P>

<P>Overall, three studies examined the effect of chemotherapy on advanced/metastatic colorectal cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>) and two studies examined the impact of chemotherapy on advanced stomach/gastric cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK> respectively).</P>
<P>All four studies had two-way comparisons. Two studies used the term best supportive care (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>), and two studies used the term supportive care to define the comparative arm of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A total of 483 participants were randomised in these trials; all four studies involved participants with advanced stages of the illness. <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK> conducted the trial with least number of participants (n = 36), and <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK> conducted the trial with the most number of patrticipants (n = 279).</P>

The four studies were published in the following high quality journals; British Journal of Cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>), the Lancet (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>), Annals of Oncology (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>), and the British Medical Journal (<LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>). The trial duration ranged from thirteen months (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>) to four years (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The four studies were conducted in the following countries: Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>), United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>), Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>), and Austria (<LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 12:54:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>The aims of this review were to examine the outcomes of surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, compared with supportive care in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. This updated review does not provide additional information on this treatment as no new relevant studies were included. Seven studies were found that compared chemotherapy plus supportive care with supportive care alone. However, only four of the seven RCTs of gastrointestinal cancers had outcomes that were considered relevant and were subsequently included in this review. Only two of these trials had recruited more than 100 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>). The heterogeneity of the studies in terms of patient population, interventions and control groups considered, meant that it was not feasible to undertake a meta-analysis. We found no trials comparing surgery or radiotherapy (or combination of surgery and radiotherapy) with supportive care. No trial conducted in a language other than English was identified. The four trials were published in high quality journals and were published between 1993 and 1998.</P>
<P>The results of the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK> suggests that octreotide therapy seems to confer a survival benefit in advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients (advanced stomach, gastric and colorectal cancer patients) refractory to chemotherapy. However, the authors of this study suggest the need to conduct further studies to confirm these results. In addition to this, since quality of life assessment was not included in this study, the authors have suggested that future studies should aim to determine the impact of octreotide treatment in terms of not only survival but also patients' quality of life. This was the only study to describe the concealment of allocation in detail.</P>
<P>The trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK> recommends the use of irinotecan as the standard second line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer for whom fluorouracil has failed as a new reference for forthcoming trials. Patients treated with irinotecan plus supportive care had a longer survival, fewer tumour-related symptoms and better quality of life than patients treated with supportive care alone.</P>
<P>The trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK> suggests chemotherapy (ELF/FLv regimen) plus best supportive care enhances both the length and quality of life in advanced gastric cancer patients. However, the authors do not advocate the routine use of this treatment as the number of patients who benefit from it is still rather limited, and therefore recommend that it should be considered for a selective group of patients.</P>
<P>The trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK> suggests that combination chemotherapy (5-FU, leucovorin, and cisplatin) plus supportive care enhances both survival and quality of life in symptomatic patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. As this study had the smallest number of patients (n = 36), the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Overall the results show that for most of the trials included in this review, certain forms of chemotherapy plus supportive care improve both survival, quality of life and the median time to disease progression in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers (stomach, gastric and colorectal cancers). The benefits of chemotherapy must however be weighed against treatment toxicity and the effect on quality of life, yet most of these trials had survival as a primary outcome measure, with both toxicity and quality of life as outcomes of secondary importance. Toxicity was well documented in all four trials, as were adverse effects of treatment and withdrawals and dropouts. Apart from the use of analgesics in the supportive care arm for pain relief in the four studies, there was no detailed description of pain severity and pain relief in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>). Furthermore, there did not seem to be much emphasis on symptom control in the four studies which was only briefly described.</P>
<P>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is the world's leading cancer quality of life questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Garratt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garratt 2002</LINK>). It was used in only two of the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>) to assess the quality of life. One trial used a modified version of the FLIC to assess quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>), and one trial did not include a quality of life assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinu 1995</LINK>). The variety of assessments used in the four studies over varying periods makes it extremely difficult to make any direct comparisons.</P>
<P>Older patients over the age of 75 years were underrepresented in all four of the trials, all imposed an upper age limit for recruitment of subjects, yet colorectal cancer predominantly affects older people and over half of the deaths occur in people over the age of 75 (<LINK REF="REF-Silverberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverberg 1990</LINK>). However, such insidious ageism has been challenged by policy directives aimed at providing care 'regardless of age, on the basis of clinical need alone' (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health</LINK> 2001).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the studies as described by the Jadad and Rinck scales was good. The Oxford Quality scale is more appropriate to conventional RCTs of medical interventions, while the Rinck criteria are more detailed and focus on the broader aspects of trials in comprehensive palliative cancer care. All four trials had a good description of baseline characteristics, inclusion criteria, adverse/side effects, description of withdrawals and dropouts and analysis was performed according to intention to treat. There were, however, some short-<BR/>comings with regards to fulfilling robust methodology, e.g. the detailed description of the method of randomization was poorly described in at least three of four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1993</LINK>). We recommend that future trials are designed and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement (CONSORT statement). This statement was developed in the mid 1990s to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs, and comprises a checklist and flow diagram for reporting an RCT. The CONSORT statement was revised in May 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). The revised CONSORT statement includes a 22-item checklist and a flow diagram, and its aim is to help researchers improve the quality of results of simple two-group parallel RCTs covering all aspects from introduction, methods, results to discussion, with the ultimate aim of improving trial design and reporting.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition of supportive care in cancer</HEADING>
<P>A coordinated European activity funded by the European Community and facilitated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Pain &amp; Symptom Control Task Force, has led to the agreement of the following definition for supportive care in cancer treatment:</P>
<P>"Supportive care for cancer patients is the multi professional attention to the individual's overall physical, psychosocial, spiritual and cultural needs, and should be available at all stages of the illness, for patients of all ages, and regardless of the current intention of any anti-cancer treatment" (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmedzai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmedzai 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The philosophy of seeing the patient as a whole person is an acknowledgement that the effects of disease in any part of the individual's being will impact on all other areas of the self. Therefore, to offer effective supportive care the multi-professional team must assess the person holistically, and manage care in a way which allows for the inter-connectedness of the problems to be acknowledged, with team members liaising to provide care which optimises quality of life.</P>
<P>Physical care focuses on the impact of the primary, and often secondary, disease on the patient's activities of daily living. Levels of pain and other distressing symptoms are assessed, with a multidisciplinary care plan designed to offer combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, alongside information and explanation.</P>
<P>Psychosocial care focuses on understanding the emotional state of the patient, and what impact the illness has made on their functioning as a person within the family or other relationship. By necessity, a thorough assessment of this care involves all those affected by the person's illness, since roles, responsibilities, relationships and financial matters may act as triggers to intensify and exacerbate other symptomatology.</P>
<P>Spiritual care relates to understanding personal belief systems, including religion, which may support or distress the patient and those close to him/her through the disease process. These are often deeply personal areas for patients and have proved difficult to assess. However, an understanding of the spiritual being of a person can enable discussion and therapeutic work, together with the presence and practice of a chaplain (or faith leader). These aspects of supportive care are particularly relevant in palliative care and bereavement counseling (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The assessment of cultural needs by the multidisciplinary team should ensure that care and support does not deny the patient any aspect of their regular cultural life. Cultural needs range from the provision of a suitable diet, to the intervention of an interpreter for those who cannot communicate freely in the team's language, and to the planning of cultural aspects of death, dying and funeral procedures which will be of importance to both the patient and family (<LINK REF="REF-Osoba-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osoba 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The EORTC definition is one of the first rigorous consensual attempts to encapsulate this difficult concept, and no doubt the definition will need to be updated as the subject develops and countries become more familiar and experienced with its implications. The EORTC definition of supportive care is not the same as usual care. The starting assumption is that supportive care is better than usual care. Furthermore, it is not suggested that supportive care should not be available to other treatment groups. In fact it is ethical to ensure that supportive care should be available to all other treatment groups, and active intervention to specific groups.</P>
<P>As well as the new definition for supportive care, the coordinated activity of the EORTC has identified several key elements and characteristics that are regarded as essential or important for implementation, particularly within the context of clinical trials. These are summarised in Appendices A and B, respectively of the report by <LINK REF="REF-Ahmedzai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmedzai 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>All four trials had a description of supportive care; however, the descriptions were often vague and heterogenous, thus making direct comparisons almost impossible. In addition, most of the components of the EORTC definition of supportive care were not discussed in any of the trials. Although supportive care issues have not been considered in detail previously, any future studies addressing supportive care issues should use the EORTC definition of supportive care as a checklist thus standardizing the use of supportive care across all studies, and authors need to document the components of supportive care in more detail. The EORTC definition of supportive care should be used as a guide by those designing trials with supportive care, as some of the elements described may not be applicable to clinical trials. The EORTC definition will no doubt need to be updated as the subject develops and countries around the world become more familiar with its implications. It must however be stressed that, because the EORTC definition of supportive care was developed in 2001, it would be unrealistic and unfair to expect all of the identified trials which were conducted prior to this date to be without some methodological shortcomings with regards to both defining and reporting of supportive care trials. The use of the term 'best supportive care' which seems to imply that it is better than usual care when there is no evidence of this, should be replaced with just supportive care.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal cancers are collectively the most common malignancies in the world with colorectal cancer accounting for most of these malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlgren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlgren 2001</LINK>). Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers (particularly inoperable gastrointestinal cancer) are reported to have a poor prognosis, with life prolonging options being somewhat limited. A major aim in this group of patients should be symptom control and maintaining or improving their quality of life. All four trials reported survival as a primary outcome variable. As these patients were in advanced stages of the illness, and in the context of palliative treatment, survival may be less of importance than the measurement of symptom control and quality of life. Therefore future trials should focus on these issues in addition to survival.</P>
<P>In summary, there is some consistent evidence that patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer benefit in both survival and quality of life by a combination of chemotherapy plus supportive care compared to receiving supportive care alone.</P>

<P>Since the last version of this review no new studies were found and therefore the conclusions remain the same. Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer may benefit in both survival and quality of life by a combination of chemotherapy and supportive care. In addition, this work could be used to evaluate the usefulness of the EORTC definition of supportive care, and may have important consequences for the organisation of cancer services as a whole.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:50:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last version of this review no new studies were found and therefore the conclusions remain the same. Further studies are still needed to clarify the effect of chemotherapy plus supportive care versus supportive care alone in gastrointestinal cancer patients using standardized validated instruments that examine symptom control, quality of life, toxicity, pain severity and pain relief in addition to survival and other palliative measures both prior to and after treatment completion. Furthermore, future studies should not impose upper age limits at trial entry. As this does not reflect the age distribution of the disease. Until this is achieved it is extremely difficult to make any direct comparisons between the studies. The challenge for the future is to strive for major improvements in trial design and reporting of results.</P>
<P>In summary, we recommend that the evidence base for this area could be further improved by the following measures:</P>
<OL>
<LI>better ways of appraising quality of supportive care trials;</LI>
<LI>improved criteria for including supportive care interventions into cancer RCTs, such as those put forward by the EORTC;</LI>
<LI>more large studies using standardised quality of life scales such as the EORTC QLQ-C30.</LI>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Authors conclusions: <BR/>Despite the side effects of treatment, patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer, and for whom fluorouracil has failed, have a longer survival, fewer tumour-related symptoms, and better QoL when treated with irinotecan than with SC alone. Irinotecan can therefore be recommended as the standard second line therapy in colorectal cancer and as a new reference for forthcoming trials</P>

<P>Authors conclusions:<BR/>Chemotherapy can add to both the quantity and QoL in advanced gastric cancer. The number of patients who benefit from treatment is, however still rather limited. The authors do not advocate the routine use of this treatment in the light of yet limited effects and the costs, but rather consider it to selected patients after realistic and adequate information</P>

<P>Patients in both arms could receive supportive care such as haemotransfusions for anaemic state; antibiotics to control infections; analgesics, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids; corticosteroids; and vitamin supplements. Also patients could be treated with radiation therapy for painful osseous metastases and pelvic recurrences. In case of jaundice due to an obstruction of biliary tree a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage could be placed.</P>

<P>In supportive care alone group, patients were given best supportive care and were seen every three weeks. Supportive care was defined as the best care available judged by attending physician, according to institutional standards for each centre. Supportive care included antibiotics, analgesics, transfusions, corticosteroids, or any other symptomatic therapy (except irinotecan or other topoisomerase I inhibitor), and/or assistance of a psychotherapist. Localised radiation therapy to alleviate symptoms such as pain was allowed provided that total dose delivered was in palliative range according to institutional standards. In irinotecan group patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan.<BR/>Analysis of best supportive care<BR/>Supportive care and concomitant medications were reported at each visit (every three weeks in both groups). They were classified using the WHO dictionary, and further sub-classification was done using the WHO code for anatomical therapeutic class (ATC). With these classifications, analgesics were divided into opioids or non-opioids and analysed in three week blocks.<BR/>

<P>The principles of best supportive care, given in both randomization groups have been presented before.<BR/>Best supportive care was given in both groups with the same high intensity and included psychosocial support and attempts to relieve any symptoms (analgesics, antiemetic drugs, nutritional support, corticosteroids, palliative radiotherapy, surgery and so on). These principles have been outlined in a regional care programme.</P>
