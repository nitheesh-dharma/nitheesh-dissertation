<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>We designed this review to compare drainage with non-drainage in people having colorectal surgery (a procedure that is used to repair damage to the colon, rectum, anus and muscle of the lower belly) with bowel anastomosis (where two ends of the bowel are joined to each other). Elective colorectal surgery (where surgery is planned in advance rather than carried out as an emergency) often involves removal of part of the large bowel for a variety of diagnoses with subsequent anastomosis. There is the option for the surgeon to place a drain at the time of surgery to prevent leakage from the anastomosis. This is called a prophylactic drain. Cochrane review authors assessed the evidence for the routine use of prophylactic drain placement after the formation of colorectal anastomoses.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included three clinical trials involving 908 participants. The trials were conducted in Germany and France. All trials compared routine anastomotic drainage versus no anastomotic drainage after elective colorectal surgery. The evidence was current to February 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review showed no apparent difference in anastomotic leak, death, radiological (x-ray) evidence of anastomotic leak, wound infection or need for re-operation. We found insufficient evidence to support the use of routine prophylactic drains after elective colorectal anastomosis. We based our conclusion on limited evidence with relatively small numbers of participants; this means that it is difficult to detect differences between treatment groups that may be present.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was low, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions about the use of routine prophylactic drains after elective colorectal anastomosis. Additional studies are needed to strengthen the conclusion drawn by this systematic review and to provide further analysis using modern colorectal surgery. We found no new evidence since the previous version of our systematic review of 2004.</P>

<P>Elective colorectal surgery can involve formation of bowel anastomoses, which may be complicated by postoperative anastomotic leaks. Routine intra-operative drain placement aims to help clinicians diagnose and treat postoperative leaks. There is little agreement on the prophylactic use of drains for elective colorectal anastomoses.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Formation of colorectal anastomoses is common in people undergoing colorectal surgery. A large number of intra-abdominal conditions requiring bowel resection result in the requirement for a bowel anastomosis, for example, colorectal carcinoma and inflammatory bowel disease. There are varying techniques for anastomosis formation, including hand-sewn, stapled and, less commonly, tissue adhesive techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Sajid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajid 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slieker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slieker 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vakalopoulos-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakalopoulos 2013</LINK>). Complications of bowel anastomoses include anastomotic leak (AL), bleeding, fistulae and strictures (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2013</LINK>). Although a consensus definition of AL is lacking, most surgeons agree that extravasation of contrast on imaging and faecal material seen in drains constitutes a clinical leak (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2013</LINK>). In simple terms, AL can be defined as the leak of bowel contents from a surgical join between two hollow viscera. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is often used to confirm clinical suspicion of the diagnosis; however, overall sensitivity of CT scanning to diagnose leakage is estimated at 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.75) for colonic resection (<LINK REF="REF-Kornmann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kornmann 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>AL can be divided into generalised (gross abdominal faecal contamination) or local (localised faecal contamination in the peri-anastomotic space). Practically, there is a large difference between the management of a generalised versus local leak. A generalised leak will result in diffuse peritonitis, acute sepsis and necessitates immediate surgical re-intervention. This will be performed as an emergency procedure (laparoscopic or open) to wash out the contaminated abdomen, take down or reinforce the anastomosis, defunction the person using a stoma to divert faeces from the leak, or a combination of these.</P>
<P>A small contained localised leak in the peri-anastomotic space may produce a localised collection requiring radiological drainage. If the person has already been defunctioned with a stoma at the time of the initial resection, there may be little clinical sequelae. Small contained leaks can lead to enterocutaneous fistula formation or anastomotic stricturing with a significant negative impact on outcome.</P>
<P>AL is associated with prolonged hospital stay; increased morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Montedori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montedori 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsujinaka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsujinaka 2011</LINK>); and, more pertinently, increased local recurrence, reduced survival following cancer resections and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Mirnezami-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirnezami 2011</LINK>). A number of studies have used multivariate analysis of participant cohorts to identify risk factors for AL: these are male sex, history of radiotherapy, increased intra-operative times, peri-operative blood transfusion, a high American Society of Anethesiologists (ASA) score and body mass index greater than 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Boccola-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boccola 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kube-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kube 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2015</LINK>). The incidence of AL varies from 2% to 39% and is inversely proportional to the distance of the anastomosis from the anal verge (<LINK REF="REF-Montedori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montedori 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vignali-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignali 1997</LINK>). A variety of clinical markers are currently being developed to predict and diagnose AL accurately and as early as possible. These include elevated cytokines, metallo-proteinases, serum C-reactive protein and reduced intra-operative rectal stump blood flow as measured by laser Doppler (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cini 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kao-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vignali-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignali 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>AL remains a major and frequent complication following colorectal surgery, and is associated with significant postoperative morbidity and mortality. The incidence of AL after colon surgery is reported to be 1% to 3%, and after colorectal surgery around 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Alberts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberts 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borowski-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borowski 2010</LINK>). Mortality increases significantly after AL, with AL associated with a 16% mortality compared to 3% without AL (<LINK REF="REF-Bakker-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakker 2014</LINK>). It still remains a feared complication in colorectal surgery. Surgical strategies to minimise the risk of AL include creating an anastomosis under no tension, with an adequate blood supply and in a surgical field free of infection.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of routine prophylactic drains when performing an elective colorectal anastomosis has been debated since the late 1980s. The usefulness of the drain to act as an early indicator of AL and a means of localised drainage to prevent AL remain key points in this debate. This is weighed against drain-related complications including drain-site wound infection, pain, herniation and bleeding. There is the suggestion that drain placement may itself be a risk factor for AL as placement of the drain in close proximity to the anastomosis may mechanically disrupt the tissue or blood supply to the join (<LINK REF="REF-Tsujinaka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsujinaka 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-16 22:12:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The prophylactic use of a drain adjacent to the anastomosis could evacuate peri-anastomotic fluid collections, reducing the risk of sepsis and pressure in and around the anastomosis and thus decrease the risk of AL.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to compare outcomes after elective colorectal surgery with and without the use of prophylactic anastomotic drains.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assessed and summarised the current evidence regarding the efficacy of routine abdominal drainage for colorectal anastomosis. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jesus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesus 2004</LINK>). The comparisons within the review should assist people and their clinicians in choosing an appropriate surgical procedure with a better knowledge of the current evidence. The review serves to highlight the current limitations in the literature and to highlight the need for further research.</P>

<P>Three review authors (RR, SA and JD) performed an initial screen of the titles and abstracts retrieved by the search. We retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (RR and JD) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion in the review. We included all relevant trials irrespective of whether they reported on measured outcome data. We corresponded with study investigators, as required, to clarify study eligibility or to seek further data where necessary. We resolved disagreements about study eligibility by discussion or by a third review author (RN).

<P>All included RCTs were parallel in design, therefore the unit of analysis was the individual participant. Should we identify any cluster-randomised trials in future updates, we will include cluster RCTs in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. Some types of reporting bias (e.g. publication bias, multiple publication bias, language bias) reduce the likelihood that all studies eligible for a review will be retrieved. If all eligible studies are not retrieved, the review may also be biased. In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise the potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data. We sought published protocols and compared the outcomes between the protocol and the final published study. As the review included only three RCTs, the use of funnel plots to evaluate publication bias was not appropriate.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When studies were sufficiently similar, we combined the data using a fixed-effect model. The trials were clinically heterogeneous; however, there were not enough to inform the distribution of effects in a random-effects model, therefore the choice of a fixed-effect model was due to the small number of trials. An increase in the RRs of a particular outcome, which is detrimental to the participant (e.g. AL) is displayed graphically in the meta-analysis to the right of the centre line and a decrease in the RR of an outcome to the left of the centre line.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the outcomes anastomotic dehiscence and mortality for intra-abdominal drainage versus no drainage for elective colorectal surgery using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADEpro Guideline Development tool (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro</LINK>).</P>
<P>The GRADE approach classifies the quality of evidence in one of four grades:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect;</LI>
<LI>moderate: further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate;</LI>
<LI>low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence on the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate;</LI>
<LI>very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The quality of evidence can be downgraded by one (serious concern) or two levels (very serious concern) for the following reasons: risk of bias, inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity, inconsistency of results), indirectness (indirect population, intervention, control or outcomes) and imprecision (wide CIs, single trial). The quality can also be upgraded by one level due to a large summary effect estimate.</P>

There was no detectable difference in mortality between the drainage and non-drainage groups (<LINK REF="STD-Mennigen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mennigen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Merad 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merad-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Merad 1999</LINK>). Re-operation rates were consistent between the two groups, suggesting that in the event of AL, a drain placed at the time of surgery may not have a therapeutic benefit or change the outcome. However, the power of the analyses in this review was low, therefore, no firm conclusions can be made based on current evidence (<LINK REF="STD-Mennigen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mennigen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Merad 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merad-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Merad 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of AL in the two drainage groups was also not affected by whether the anastomosis was intra- or extra-peritoneal, there was no evidence of a greater benefit in drains covering low rectal anastomoses (<LINK REF="STD-Merad-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Merad 1999</LINK>). This subgroup analysis was limited in its conclusion due to limited participant numbers and a very low event rate of AL (4%); low participant numbers makes it difficult for analyses to detect differences between groups that may be present. Many surgeons routinely place drains after mid- to low-rectal resections with a view to draining pelvic haematomas postoperatively rather than detecting or preventing ALs. Further high-quality large RCTs are required to address this topic in greater detail.</P>
<P>There may be several reasons why drains placed at surgery appear to be of no benefit. Following surgery, drains will often become blocked, eradicating their therapeutic potential (<LINK REF="REF-Averbach-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Averbach 1995</LINK>). Drains may also become displaced from their original placement site. Furthermore, the studies employed in this meta-analysis used various types of drain. The differing properties of the drainage systems used could have affected the results and needs to be investigated further. The reasoning against the use of drains in colorectal surgery includes concerns about potential negative effects of drains. Indeed, the routine use of drains is not recommended in colorectal enhanced recovery programmes, which have become widespread in recent years, due to concerns regarding increased pain, difficulty with mobilisation and subsequent complications (<LINK REF="REF-Lassen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The conclusions of this review were limited by the heterogeneous nature of the operations performed in the included studies, which included both intra- and extra-peritoneal anastomoses. The lack of recruitment of sufficient sample sizes in the included studies means that the conclusions may be limited due to inadequate power and, therefore, a type II error. In particular, the studies included are relatively dated and there was no new evidence for this review since 2004. The available evidence was insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding the benefit or harm from routine drainage in colorectal resections as the two main results from the pooled data were contradictory and inconsistent. Further trials are required, not only to determine the safety and efficacy of drains, but also their role in diagnosing anastomotic leakage, which has been one of the purported benefits of routine drain placement. In addition, trials are needed to investigate the effects of drainage in the emergency colorectal surgical setting which is not addressed in this review.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of abdominal drainage for elective colorectal anastomosis. There were no statistical significant differences in the primary outcome, postoperative anastomotic dehiscence, or secondary outcomes including mortality, surgical re-intervention, radiological anastomotic dehiscence and wound infection.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials recruited participants considered at low anaesthetic and surgical risk, therefore, the applicability of this review to inform practice in high-risk people undergoing surgery is limited. There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding differences in efficacy for people with benign disease compared with people with malignancy. All trials recruited participants within high resource settings, which limits the applicability of this research to inform practice within low resource settings. All included studies reported the primary and secondary outcomes but there was substantial clinical heterogeneity. Clinically, colorectal surgery has moved towards minimally invasive laparoscopic operations and enhanced recovery pathways. The studies included did not address the effectiveness of drains in current colorectal surgical practice.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence for effectiveness outcomes was low, denoting that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The methodological bias was low in the included trials as methods of randomisation were described, and it was unclear if blinding was likely to affect the objective primary and secondary outcome measures. There was sufficient evidence to reach preliminary conclusions regarding primary and secondary outcomes. Lack of power calculations in the included studies means that the conclusions drawn may be subject to type II errors or due to problems in participant recruitment to the trial.</P>

<P>The strengths of this systematic review include its robust search strategy (guided and developed by the Colorectal Cancer Review Group) and the methodological design and statistical analysis (developed with reference to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)). The protocol was peer-reviewed, published and freely available. We applied no limitations such as a publication type, language or date restrictions. Two review authors independently conducted study selection, risk of bias assessment and data collection. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by a third review author (RN or PN). All review authors have stated that there are no conflicts of interest. Systematic reviews are not without limitations. The comprehensive search strategy identified only three trials, making extrapolation difficult. Notably, two of the studies are from the same research group, which may be a potential source of bias. The studies included are relatively dated in surgical practice and do not account for advances in laparoscopic surgical approaches. This may limit the applicability of the conclusions to current practice.</P>

<P>The results from this systematic review were in agreement with previous systematic reviews on this topic, which also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of routine drainage in elective colorectal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Karliczek-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karliczek 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urbach-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbach 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jesus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesus 2004</LINK>). We found no new evidence for this review compared to the first published version of the systematic review in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Jesus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesus 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of this review agree with additional systematic reviews on the routine use of drains for abdominal surgery including gastrectomy, liver resection, cholecystectomy and incisional hernia repair (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy--2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2011</LINK>). There remains a paucity of high-quality RCTs in this field and large-scale RCTs are required to provide robust scientific evidence in current surgical practice.</P>

<P>There remains no firm evidence for the prophylactic use of drains in preventing anastomotic leak after colorectal surgery, although the review also does not reveal any significant contraindication to the use of drains. The conclusions of this review were based on evidence from three studies all performed in the 1980s and 1990s with no new studies since the previous systematic review in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Jesus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesus 2004</LINK>). The applicability of the conclusions based on the included studies to current minimally invasive colorectal surgery with enhanced recovery programmes is unclear and remains a significant limitation of the review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-29 10:26:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uncertainty about the effects of drains in colorectal surgery remains. A large-scale randomised controlled trial would help to resolve these uncertainties. This trial should be performed in the context of a modern enhanced recovery programme following elective laparoscopic resection, with the drainage group having a standardised passive closed drain. All participants would need to be randomised to drainage or no drainage with both groups receiving enhanced recovery programmes. Blinding participants and clinicians to the intervention would not be possible. The endpoints should be clearly defined, and in addition to the endpoints used in this review, include measurements of postoperative pain, and specific drain-related complications such as herniation, wound infection and quality of life scores. A prospective protocol with consensus outcome definitions should be published. In particular, radiological anastomotic leak as an outcome measure requires a consensus opinion between three independent radiologists to confirm an anastomotic leak to prevent subjective reporting. Given the relatively high leak rates after low rectal anastomosis, this should form a separate subgroup for analysis. In addition, separate trials should be conducted to investigate the effects of drains in emergency colorectal surgery.</P>

<P>Assumed risk: anastomotic dehiscence occurred 5 times in 406 participants in the no drainage (control) group. Mortality occurred 21 times in 454 participants in the no drainage (control) group.</P>
<P>The evidence was downgraded to low quality according to GRADE methods; there was substantial clinical heterogeneity and further research in current laparoscopic colorectal practice is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect of drainage. In addition, there was a low event rate for anastomotic leak and mortality within the studies assessed, which may not accurately reflect current clinical estimates.</P>
