<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 14:16:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines. Crohn's disease frequently occurs in the lower part of the small intestine, called the ileum, but it can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptoms of Crohn's disease are abdominal pain, often in the lower right area, and diarrhea. Natalizumab blocks the adhesion and migration of white blood cells into the gut reducing chronic inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. Four high quality studies were reviewed. The studies tested 1692 people over the age of eighteen who had moderate to severe Crohn's disease. The subjects received 1 to 3 infusions of natalizumab (at a dosage of 300 mg or weight based dosages of 3, 4 or 6 mg/kg) or placebo (fake infusions). The studies lasted for 12 weeks. The results of the studies indicate that natalizumab is effective therapy for some people with active Crohn's disease. People with active disease responded positively to even one treatment of the drug and the studies examined showed increased benefits with additional injections of natalizumab. More people improved through treatment using natalizumab than those using the fake treatments. The drug was generally well tolerated and side effects occurred infrequently. Serious side effects occurred rarely (range 7 to 11% for natalizumab and placebo patients). Few patients withdrew from the studies due to side effects (2 to 8% for natalizumab compared to 3 to 7% for placebo). Side effects that occurred during the trials included: headache, worsening of Crohn's disease, abdominal pain, arthralgia, colitis, influenza syndrome, infection, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypersensitivity-like reactions, and the development of antibodies against natalizumab. Recently, it was found that two patients who received natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1 for multiple sclerosis and one patient who received natalizumab in combination with azathioprine for Crohn's disease developed a severe disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in two deaths. PML is a serious infection of the nervous system. However an investigation of more than 3500 patients who took natalizumab found no new cases of PML. It was discovered that PML is not always fatal and regular testing of patients could provide adequate safety and ensure the well-being of those taking natalizumab. However, the benefits of natalizumab for people with Crohn's disease should be carefully weighed against the potential risk of serious adverse events such as the possibility of infection of the nervous system.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease involves migration of leukocytes into gut tissue and subsequent inflammation. Natalizumab (Tysabri®, Elan Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec) a recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks adhesion and subsequent migration of leukocytes into the gut by binding the &#945;4 integrin is a member of a new class of molecules known as selective adhesion molecule (SAM) inhibitors. The results of animal studies suggest that &#945;4 integrin blockade could be a useful therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. The results of randomized controlled trials suggest that natalizumab may be an effective therapy for active Crohn's disease. This systematic review summarizes the current evidence on the use of natalizumab for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of natalizumab for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A computer assisted search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Review Group Specialized Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant publications between 1966 and September 2006. The medical subject heading (MeSH) terms "Crohn disease" or "inflammatory bowel disease", "Natalizumab" or "Antegren" or "Tysabri" and "Antibodies, Monoclonal" were used to perform key word searches of each database. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Personal contacts, leaders in the field, and the manufacturers were contacted to identify other studies which may not be published. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included only randomized controlled trials comparing natalizumab to a placebo or control therapy for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 4.2.8). All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. For pooled data, summary test statistics were derived using the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. Fixed and random effects models were used where appropriate. The definitions of treatment success, remission and clinical improvement were set by the authors of each paper, and the data were combined for analysis only if these definitions were sufficiently similar. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Pooled data from the four included studies suggest that natalizumab (300 mg or 3 to 4 mg/kg) is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. This benefit is statistically significant for one, two and three infusion treatments. There was a trend toward increased benefit with additional infusions of natalizumab. Natalizumab appears to provide greater benefit for patient subgroups characterized by objective confirmation of active inflammation or chronically active disease despite conventional therapies. These subgroup analyses demonstrated significantly greater clinical response and remission rates for natalizumab compared with placebo in patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels, active disease despite the use of immunosuppressants, or prior anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. These benefits were apparent for both short term (one infusion) and longer term treatment (two or three infusions). Natalizumab was generally well tolerated and the safety profile observed in the four included studies was similar. Adverse events occurred infrequently and were experienced by a similar proportion of natalizumab and placebo treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences between natalizumab and placebo treated patients in the proportions of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or those who experienced serious adverse events. The included trials lacked adequate power to detect serious adverse events that occur infrequently. Recently, two patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a and one patient with Crohn's disease treated with natalizumab in combination with azathioprine developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in two patient deaths. A retrospective investigation was conducted to assess the risk of PML in natalizumab treated patients and no new cases were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Pooled data suggest that natalizumab is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. The clinical benefit of induction therapy with natalizumab in Crohn's disease should be weighed against the potential risk of serious adverse events. Preliminary data from the retrospective investigation of adverse events associated with natalizumab suggest that it may be possible to identify patients at risk for PML by testing for the appearance of JC virus in plasma. </P>

The results of animal studies suggest that &#945;4 integrin blockade could be a useful therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment with natalizumab resulted in reduced intestinal inflammation and improvement of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease in a cotton-top tamarin model of colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Podolsky-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Podolsky 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hesterberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesterberg 1996</LINK>).

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>A computer assisted search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Review Group Specialized Trials Register and the on-line databases MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant publications between 1966 and September 2006. The medical subject heading (MeSH) terms "Crohn disease" or "inflammatory bowel disease", "Natalizumab" or "Antegren" or "Tysabri" and "Antibodies, Monoclonal" were used to perform key word searches of each database. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Personal contacts and leaders in the field were contacted to identify other studies which may not be published. The manufacturer of natalizumab (Elan Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA and Biogen Idec, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) was contacted for additional data.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection<BR/>All publications identified by the search strategy were assessed independently by two authors (JKM and JWDM), and relevant studies were selected according to the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement among authors was resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>The methodological quality of each RCT was assessed independently by two authors (JKM and JWDM) using the criteria described in the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Any disagreement between authors was resolved by consensus. <BR/> <BR/>Research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Allocation concealment was rated as: adequate (e.g. centralized or pharmacy controlled randomization, pre-numbered or coded identical containers which are administered serially to participants, on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered, or sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes), unclear (i.e. not described in the trial report), or inadequate (e.g. alternation, the use of case record numbers, dates of birth, etc.).</P>
<P>When insufficient information was provided to determine methodological quality study authors were contacted to confirm the method of randomization and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>Two authors (JKM and JWDM) independently extracted data using a data extraction form. Any disagreement among authors was resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Data analysis<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 4.2.8). All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Data were extracted from the original research articles and converted into 2x2 tables. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the chi-square test. As the chi-square test has low power in the situation of a meta-analysis, when trials have small sample size or are few in number, a P value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. For pooled data, summary test statistics were derived using the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed effects model was used for pooling of data when statistical heterogeneity was not present. When statistical heterogeneity was present a random effects model was used. The definitions of treatment success, remission and clinical improvement were set by the authors of each paper, and the data were combined for analysis only if these definitions were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Targan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 2006</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK> manuscript reports the results of both a natalizumab induction trial (ENACT-1) and a maintenance of remission trial (ENACT-2). The results of ENACT-2 were excluded because it was a maintenance of remission trial. The results of the ENCORE trial are reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 2006</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>In this study, 248 adult patients (<U>&gt;</U> 18 years) with clinical evidence of moderate to severe Crohn's disease, defined by a CDAI of at least 220 but no more than 450 were recruited from 35 centers in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom for a twelve week induction trial. Patients who received methotrexate, cyclosporine, or any investigational drugs within three months prior to randomization were excluded. Patients taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine were required to have a stable dose for at least four months prior to randomization. Other exclusion criteria included: prior treatment with any antibody agent, current use of more than 25 mg per day of oral prednisolone or another corticosteroid at an equivalent dose, elemental diet or parenteral nutrition, infectious or neoplastic diseases of the bowel, bowel surgery within three months prior to randomization, the presence of an ostomy, the presence of symptoms due mainly to fibrotic strictures, and a clinical impression that the patient would likely require abdominal surgery. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups using a computer generated, site stratified, block randomization schedule. The patients and study personnel were not aware of treatment assignment. Each group received two intravenous infusions four weeks apart at week zero and week four. The four treatment groups consisted of two infusions of placebo (n=63), one infusion of natalizumab (3 mg/kg) and one infusion of placebo (n=68), two infusions of natalizumab (3 mg/kg; n=66), and two infusions of natalizumab (6 mg/kg; n=51). The primary outcome variable was the proportion of patients who entered remission at week six. Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score of less than 150. Clinical response, a secondary outcome, was defined as a decrease in the CDAI score of at least 70 points from baseline. Other secondary outcome variables included the serum concentration of C-reactive protein, absolute neutrophil counts, serum antibodies against natalizumab and health-related quality of life as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Patients were evaluated at baseline and weeks two, four, six, eight and twelve. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2001</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 30 adult patients (<U>&gt;</U> 18 years of age) with clinical evidence of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease, defined by a CDAI of <U>&gt;</U> 151 and <U>&lt;</U> 450 were recruited from two centers in the United Kingdom. Patients had Crohn's disease confirmed by two or more of the following diagnostic criteria at least three months prior to study entry: history, radiologic or endoscopic intestinal appearance, histology, presence of Crohn's related fistula and abscess formation. Female patients had to use effective contraception throughout the study follow-up period. Oral corticosteroids (<U>&lt;</U> 40 mg prednisolone or <U>&lt;</U> 9 mg budesonide per day) were allowed if the dose was stable within two weeks of study entry. Patients receiving 5-ASA drugs or azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine were included if treatment had not been started within two months or the dose increased within four months of study entry. Exclusion criteria included: pregnancy or breast-feeding; patients weighing more than 100 kg; patients with a CDAI score &gt; 450 or were inpatients because of Crohn's disease; patients treated with cyclosporine, methotrexate, or tacrolimus therapy; patients who had abdominal surgery within three months of entry or were considered likely to require surgery within three months of study entry; patients with an ileostomy or colostomy; patients with laboratory-confirmed intestinal infection; and patients with a current or past malignant neoplasm. Patients were randomized in a 2 to 1 ratio using a table of random numbers to receive an intravenous infusion of natalizumab (3 mg/kg; n=18) or placebo (n=12). The patients and study personnel were not aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome variable was the change in mean CDAI at two weeks post infusion. Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score of less than 150. Other secondary outcome variables included IBDQ, serum levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, full blood count, peripheral blood T cells and B cells, serum natalizumab and anti-natalizumab antibody concentrations. Patients were evaluated at study entry and at weeks one, two, four, eight, and twelve post infusion.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>
<BR/>In the ENACT-1 study, 905 adult patients (<U>&gt;</U> 18 years of age) with Crohn's disease of at least 6 months duration who had moderately to severely active disease as defined by a baseline CDAI score of 220 to 450 points were recruited from 142 centers in North America, Europe and selected countries around the world for a twelve week induction trial. Radiologic or endoscopic studies were required within 36 months and after surgery for Crohn's disease to confirm the presence of active Crohn's disease. Concomitant medication for Crohn's disease, including stable doses of 5-ASA drugs, prednisone (<U>&lt;</U> 25 mg/day), budesonide, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and antibiotics were permitted. Exclusion criteria included: patients with short bowel syndrome, an ostomy, a total colectomy, a stricture with obstructive symptoms, draining fistulas, abdominal abscess, previous natalizumab treatment or previous anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy within three months prior to study entry. Enrolment of patients who were nonresponders to anti-TNF treatment was limited to a maximum of 30% of total study enrolment. Patients were screened for eligibility two weeks prior to entry. Patients were randomized in a 4 to 1 ratio to receive an infusion of either 300 mg of natalizumab (n=724) or placebo (n=181) for a total of three infusions given at weeks zero, four and eight. Randomization was performed centrally and prospectively stratified by disease activity (CDAI &lt; 330 versus CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 330) and concurrent corticosteroid therapy. A pharmacist prepared each infusion of natalizumab or an identical appearing placebo. Neither the patients nor the study investigators were aware of treatment assignment. Patients were assessed at weeks two, four, six, eight, ten and twelve. The IBDQ was administered to assess quality of life at weeks zero, six and ten. The primary outcome variable was response at week ten which was defined as a reduction of <U>&gt;</U> 70 points in the CDAI score from baseline. Remission was defined as a CDAI score of less than 150. Other secondary outcome variables included serum levels of C-reactive protein and mean lymphocyte counts. At each assessment visit, adverse events and concomitant medications were recorded and samples were collected for laboratory evaluations. Safety evaluations included vital signs, physical examinations, hematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis.</P>

<BR/>In the ENCORE (Efficacy of Natalizumab in Crohn's Disease Response and Remission) study, 509 adult patients (<U>&gt;</U> 18 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and objective evidence of active inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] levels) were recruited from 114 centers in North America, Europe and selected countries around the world for a twelve week induction trial. Patients with a CDAI score between 220 and 450 and CRP levels greater than the upper limit of normal (2.87 mg/L) were randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive an infusion of either 300 mg natalizumab (n=259) or placebo (n=250) for a total of three infusions given at weeks zero, four and eight. Efficacy and safety were assessed at weeks four, eight and twelve. The primary outcome variable was response by week eight which was defined as a reduction of <U>&gt;</U> 70 points in the CDAI score from baseline that was sustained through week twelve. Secondary outcome variables included the proportion of patients achieving a clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) by week eight and through week twelve, and the proportion of patients in response or remission at any assessment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). A total of 1132 patients were enrolled in the three trials with 876 randomized to one infusion of natalizumab (3 to 4 mg/kg) and 256 to placebo. After two weeks 745 of 876 patients in the natalizumab group failed to enter remission compared to 231 of 256 in the placebo group. The relative risk of failure to induce remission with natalizumab was statistically significant (RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98). The absolute risk reduction or risk difference was calculated to be -0.06 (95% CI -0.10 to -0.01). The number of patients that need to be treated (number needed to treat, NNT) with one infusion of natalizumab (3 to 4 mg/kg) versus placebo to induce remission in one patient at two weeks was 17. </P>
<P>Failure to induce remission at four weeks:<BR/>Data from two randomized trials were available for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although current therapies for Crohn's disease provide benefit, they do not effectively control the disease in many patients. Most therapies are also limited by their adverse event profiles. Thus, there is a need for effective and safe treatment that can induce clinical response and remission. Pooled data from the four included studies suggest that natalizumab (300 mg and weight based doses of 3 to 4 mg/kg) is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. This benefit is statistically significant for both short and long term treatment. There was a trend toward increased benefit with additional infusions of natalizumab. </P>
<P>One infusion of natalizumab was significantly superior to placebo for induction of remission at two weeks (NNT=17) and for induction of clinical response at 4 weeks (NNT=8). Two infusions of natalizumab (3 to 4 mg/kg) were significantly superior to placebo for induction of remission at six weeks follow-up (NNT=10). Although, three infusions of natalizumab (4 mg/kg) were significantly superior to placebo for induction of remission (NNT=12) and clinical response (NNT=10) at twelve weeks follow-up these comparisons were not statistically significant at ten weeks follow-up. The proportion of patients with a clinical response at ten weeks was the primary efficacy end point for the ENACT-1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). At ten weeks 49% of the placebo group had a clinical response compared to 56% of the natalizumab group (P=0.051). The relatively high placebo response rate may have made it difficult to observe a treatment effect. This may be a consequence of the study design: the 4 to 1 randomization ratio may have led patients to believe that they would be assigned to active therapy and thus experience a beneficial effect. Another possibility is that some of the patients may not have had active inflammation. This possibility is consistent with the findings of post hoc subgroup analyses where natalizumab appears to convey greater benefit for patient subgroups characterized by objective confirmation of active inflammation or chronically active disease despite conventional therapies. Subgroup analyses demonstrated significantly greater clinical response and remission rates for natalizumab compared with placebo in patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels, active disease despite the use of immunosuppressants, or prior anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. These benefits were apparent for both short term (one infusion) and longer term treatment (two or three infusions). Three infusions of natalizumab (4 mg/kg) were significantly superior to placebo for induction of remission at ten and twelve weeks for patients with an elevated C-reactive protein at baseline (NNT=9 and 8), for patients using immunosuppressants (NNT=7 at weeks ten and twelve) and for patients previously treated with anti-TNF therapy (NNT=9 at weeks ten and twelve). Three infusions of natalizumab (4 mg/kg) were significantly superior to placebo for induction of clinical response at ten and twelve weeks for patients with an elevated C-reactive protein at baseline (NNT=8 and 7), for patients using immunosuppressants (NNT=6 at weeks ten and twelve) and for patients previously treated with anti-TNF therapy (NNT=5 at weeks ten and twelve). </P>
<P>The ENCORE study enrolled 509 patients with an elevated C-reactive protein level (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 2006</LINK>). This trial met both primary and secondary endpoints. Three infusions of natalizumab (300 mg) were significantly superior to placebo for induction of clinical response at both weeks eight and twelve (NNT=7). Three infusions of natalizumab (300 mg) were also significantly superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission at both weeks eight and twelve (NNT =10). Natalizumab was also found to be significantly superior to placebo for induction of clinical response (P &lt; 0.001) and remission (P <U>&lt;</U> 0.009) at all assessments (weeks 4, 8 and 12). <LINK REF="STD-Targan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 2006</LINK> concluded that these data support the efficacy of natalizumab as induction therapy for Crohn's disease. <BR/> <BR/>The optimal dosage and timing schedule for induction of remission and response using natalizumab therapy remains to be determined. <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2003</LINK> looked at the efficacy of two different dosages of natalizumab in comparison to placebo and did not find any advantage for two infusions of 6 mg/kg natalizumab over 3 mg/kg natalizumab. The pooled data suggest that a doses of 300 mg or weight based doses of 3 to 4 mg/kg may be effective for induction of remission and clinical response in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Three of the included studies dosed patients every four weeks for a total of two infusions (<LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2003</LINK>) and three infusions (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Targan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 2006</LINK>). No studies to date have tried to administer dosages using a different timing schedule. <BR/> <BR/>The ENACT-1 trial did not enroll patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). Although the <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2003</LINK> included patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease they did not make any comments on the efficacy of natalizumab for fistula healing and closure. There are no published data on the efficacy of natalizumab for the treatment of Crohn's fistulas. </P>
<P>Natalizumab was generally well tolerated and the safety profile observed in the four included studies was similar. Adverse events occurred infrequently and were experienced by a similar proportion of natalizumab and placebo treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or those who experienced serious adverse events up to week twelve in patients treated with one, two or three infusions of natalizumab (3 to 4 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) or placebo. For patients treated with three infusions of natalizumab (4 mg/kg) or placebo there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who withdrew from the study for any reason. <LINK REF="STD-Targan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 2006</LINK> reported that the incidence and types of adverse events were similar between groups. Adverse events experienced during the trials included: headache, worsening of Crohn's disease, abdominal pain, arthralgia, colitis, influenza syndrome, infection, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pharyngitis, infusion reactions, hypersensitivity-like reactions and the development of antibodies against natalizumab. Concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids may be protective against anti-natalizumab antibody formation (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). When persistent anti-natalizumab antibodies were present, they appear to be associated with infusion reactions, hypersensitivity-like reactions, and loss of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). None of the included studies reported any cases of lymphomas, tuberculosis or opportunistic infection related to natalizumab treatment. There were no deaths reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2001</LINK> studies. There were two deaths in the ENACT-1 trial in patients assigned to natalizumab. Neither of these deaths were attributed to treatment with natalizumab. The first patient died as a result of an occupational accident. The second patient died as a result of complications after surgery for a severe exacerbation of Crohn's disease 28 weeks after completing the ENACT-1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>All of the included trials lacked adequate power to detect serious adverse events. Recently, two patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a and one patient with Crohn's disease treated with natalizumab in combination with azathioprine developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in two patient deaths (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002d_Demasters-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">K-Demasters 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langer_x002d_Gould-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer-Gould 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Assche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Assche 2005</LINK>). The Crohn's patient received three doses of natalizumab in combination with azathioprine during ENACT-1, 9 doses of placebo in combination with azathioprine during ENACT-2 (maintenance trial) and five doses of natalizumab without concurrent azathioprine during an open label extension study (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2005</LINK>). PML is a serious opportunistic infection of the central nervous system for which there is no specific treatment. PML is caused by the reactivation of quiescent JC polyomavirus. In response to the problem the manufacturers of natalizumab (Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals) in consultation with regulatory authorities and the National Institutes of Health conducted a retrospective investigation to assess the risk of PML in natalizumab treated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Yousry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yousry 2006</LINK>). All adverse events were reviewed to identify any unrecognized occurrences of PML and exposed patients underwent neurological examination and MRI scanning. A total of 3826 patients who had participated in recent clinical trials of natalizumab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis were recruited for the evaluation. The history and either physical examination or MRI were available for 3116 patients. <LINK REF="REF-Yousry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yousry 2006</LINK> estimated that the incidence of PML associated with exposure to natalizumab is 1.0 cases per 1000 patients (95% CI 0.2 to 2.8 per 1000) in this population who received a mean of 17.9 monthly doses of natalizumab. The investigation found no new confirmed cases of PML. The duration of exposure required to put patients at risk for PML is not known. Patients who were diagnosed with PML received 8 to 37 monthly infusions. The median exposure in the evaluated patients was 30 infusions among multiple sclerosis patients and 7 among Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Yousry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yousry 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>It may be possible to predict and prevent the occurrence of PML in patients receiving natalizumab. One case study suggests that clinical PML may be preceded by JC viremia (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Assche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Assche 2005</LINK>) while another shows that PML is not uniformly fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Langer_x002d_Gould-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer-Gould 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Adelman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelman 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Berger-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2005</LINK> suggest that the prospective measurement of the JC viral load in plasma and the reduction or discontinuation of natalizumab treatment if JC virus is detected in the blood might prevent the development of PML in this setting. A similar method has been used successfully to prevent nephropathy caused by the JC virus-related BK polyomavirus in kidney-transplant patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 2005</LINK>). Further analysis of serum samples obtained from the investigation will help determine the feasibility of preventive strategies against the development of PML in patients treated with natalizumab or related drugs in the future. </P>
<P>In conclusion pooled data from the four included studies suggest that natalizumab is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. The clinical benefit of induction therapy with natalizumab in Crohn's disease should be carefully weighed against the potential risk of serious adverse events such as PML.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Pooled data from the four included studies suggest that natalizumab is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Natalizumab may be particularly beneficial for patients with active inflammation or chronically active disease despite the use of conventional therapies. Although natalizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in December 2004 its use for patient treatment and clinical trials was suspended in February 2005 because of the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients treated with natalizumab. A retrospective investigation was conducted to assess the risk of PML in natalizumab treated patients and found no new confirmed cases. Although natalizumab is currently not approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease the FDA approved a supplemental biologics licence application for the reintroduction of natalizumab monotherapy treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in June 2006. Natalizumab was also approved for this indication by the European Commission in June 2006 and Health Canada in October 2006. <BR/>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research should identify patients who are most likely to benefit from natalizumab treatment while minimizing the possibility of rare but serious adverse events. It may be possible to identify patients at risk for PML by testing for the appearance of JC virus in plasma which along with clinical suspicion will permit early diagnosis of at risk patients. </P>
