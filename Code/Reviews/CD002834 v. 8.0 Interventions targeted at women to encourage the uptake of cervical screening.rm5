<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer world-wide. Increasing the uptake of screening is of great importance in controlling this disease through early detection and treatment of pre-cancerous changes before malignancy evolves. Methods of encouraging women to undergo cervical screening include invitations, reminders, education, message framing, counselling, risk factor assessment, procedures and economic interventions. These were all examined in this review. Evidence supports the use of invitations, and to a lesser extent, educational materials. It is likely other methods are advantageous, but the evidence is not as strong. Further research is required.</P>

<P>Thirty-eight trials met our inclusion criteria. These trials assessed the effectiveness of invitational and educational interventions, counselling, risk factor assessment and procedural interventions. Heterogeneity between trials limited statistical pooling of data. Overall, however, invitations appear to be effective methods of increasing uptake. In addition, there is limited evidence to support the use of educational materials. Secondary outcomes including cost data were incompletely documented so evidence was limited. Most trials were at moderate risk of bias. Informed uptake of cervical screening was not reported in any trials.</P>

<P>There is evidence to support the use of invitation letters to increase the uptake of cervical screening. There is limited evidence to support educational interventions but it is unclear what format is most effective.

<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by age 65 years ranges from 0.8% in developed countries to 1.5% in developing countries. The management varies around the world dependent on resources and policy however the mainstay of treatment most commonly involves surgery requiring hysterectomy and chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In Europe and the USA, the 5 year survival rate is between 60% and 72% (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>) and in England and Wales between 2001 and 2006, the 5 year survival rate was 64% (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2010</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary and secondary prevention</HEADING>
<P>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is believed to be an important primary cause of cancer of the cervix, with a recent study estimating the world-wide HPV prevalence in cervical cancers to be 99.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Walboomers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walboomers 1999</LINK>). In particular, two subtypes of the virus HPV (16 and 18) are present in over 80% of invasive cervical cancers. Other known risk factors for cervical cancer include smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Brinton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brinton 1986</LINK>), the early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners,the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (<LINK REF="REF-La-Vecchia-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Vecchia 1986</LINK>) and the immunological status of the woman (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1983</LINK>). Individuals who receive immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplants and those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are therefore particularly at risk of developing pre-invasive disease. Primary strategies to prevent the development of cervical cancer focus on reducing these known risk factors by encouraging a healthy lifestyle, smoking cessation and the adoption of 'safer' sexual behaviours aimed at reducing the risk of HPV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The understanding the role of HPV in cervical cancer has led to the development of the HPV vaccination. An immunisation programme has now been rolled out across many countries. Initial results are promising, though longer term population studies are required to assess the wider benefit and provide guidance for future changes in screening policy. Until more data from the vaccine programmes are available and, in countries that do not have such programmes secondary prevention methods will need to be the mainstay of efforts to reduce cervical cancer. These secondary methods involve screening for the detection of abnormal or pre-cancerous cell changes (i.e. any changes which may precede, be associated with or carry a significant risk of developing cancer).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Screening</HEADING>
<P>The Papanicolau, or Pap smear, screening test is used world-wide and is primarily aimed at detecting pre-cancerous changes within the cervix (i.e. abnormalities in the cells of the cervix known as dysplasia) before they have an opportunity to progress to invasive carcinoma. More than 90% of cervical cancers develop within a small area of the cervix known as the transformation zone and disease progression from dysplasia to invasive cancer is usually slow, therefore providing the opportunity to detect and treat pre-cancerous disease. During a smear test, cells within the external and internal layers of the transformation zone (i.e. ecto- and endo- cervical cells) are collected and subsequently examined for abnormal cytological changes. The reliability of the technique is however dependent both on the expertise of the health professional taking the smear and the individual examining the smear. Even in the best laboratories, 5 to15% of abnormal smears may be reported as normal (<LINK REF="REF-Nottingham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nottingham 1998</LINK>). More recently the use of liquid based cytology (LBC) has reduced the number of inadequate smears and subsequent need for recalls (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the cervical cancer screening programme in 1988, the associated mortality rate in females under 35 years in the United Kingdom has fallen (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>World-wide, great variation exists between countries in terms of the coverage and uptake of cervical cancer screening. In a number of countries including the UK, Finland, Australia, Sweden and Spain, national cervical cancer screening programmes have been introduced. Such screening programmes are usually aimed at those women most at risk of developing cervical cancer (i.e. usually women aged between 20 and 65 years). Recommendations vary between countries, but women are usually screened every one to five years. In many other countries Pap smear services are provided on a much more local basis, if at all.</P>
<P>Pap smear uptake and coverage not only vary between countries, but differences also exist within countries between different socio-demographic groups, according to factors including ethnic origin, age, education and socio-economic status. Lower uptake rates have been found to occur in those women who are older, less well-educated, from lower socio-economic groups or who reside in rural locations (<LINK REF="REF-Brinton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brinton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ries-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 1999</LINK>). Certain ethnic groups have also been identified as having lower rates of Pap smear uptake, such as African-American, Hispanic and Native American in the USA and Asian women in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Luke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1994</LINK>). In many cases therefore, interventions have been aimed at trying to increase screening amongst these groups of women. Thus there are a number of factors to consider when developing interventions to increase the uptake of Pap smear screening. These factors are likely to differ between developing and developed countries and between individual populations in a country.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Encouraging the uptake of screening</HEADING>
<P>One of the major obstacles to the success of cervical cancer screening worldwide is the uptake of the programme by women. Understanding the various reasons for women not ever attending a smear or failing to continue in further rounds of screening are difficult to assess. Much work across the world has been undertaken to determine contributing factors, such as cost, anxiety, embarrassment, and fear of cancer. Women from ethnic minorities and deprived sub-groups in the population have shown consistently lower uptake over decades of screening in countries worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Moser-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moser 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 2004</LINK>). This may be attributable to health literacy especially since screening literature can include complex concepts. HPV is transmitted sexually and therefore screening and cervical cancer itself can be perceived as a consequence of promiscuity and thus have negative connotations. Encouragingly though, in a recent survey of Muslim Turkish women who mostly accept talking about sex as a taboo, the majority of women felt the recommendations from health workers was the major influence in attending screening and accepting the HPV vaccination for their daughters (<LINK REF="REF-Ilter-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilter 2010</LINK>). Given the complex nature of the factors involved a number of interventions have therefore been based on theoretical models of health behaviour, such as the Health Belief Model (<LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>) and the Transtheoretical Model (<LINK REF="STD-Rimer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rimer 1999</LINK>). It is important to realise that because of differences between populations, interventions that are effective in one setting may not be as effective in another.</P>
<P>In the UK, websites such as that provided by the NHS Cervical Screening Programme can go some way to trying breaking down barriers to screening. The website provides written, audio and visual resources aimed at answering common concerns, explaining the procedure and explanation of results. Key documents are provided in a translated format covering many languages spoken by the larger minority groups in the UK.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Informed consent</HEADING>
<P>The main focus of attention of cervical screening programmes is to increase the uptake of cervical screening. However, this must be done in the context of informed consent and understanding of the screening tests.  It is recognised that both informed uptake and consent is important since screening can cause harm with inevitable false negatives leading to women being wrongly reassured and false positives resulting in unnecessary anxiety and further investigations and possibly even treatment. In particular, informed uptake needs to be considered especially when topical media coverage, exemplified by the cervical cancer sufferer Jade Goody in the UK, can result in such an increase in women attending screening whether required or not (an increase of 3.6 million women screened in 2008/09 compared to 3.2 million in the previous year) yet the numbers soon fall when the media interest settles (3.3. million women screened in 2009/10). (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Information-Centre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Information Centre 2010</LINK>).</P>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-08 11:31:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The incidence of cervical cancer is reduced by 93.5%, 92.5%, 90.8%, 83.6% and 64.1% if women have screening every year, every 2 years, every 3 years, every five years and every 10 years respectively; these screening intervals would mean women having 50, 25, 16, 10 and 5 smear tests respectively in their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 1986</LINK>). More recently, through modelling analyses, it has been shown that extending the re-screening interval from one year to every three years results in an average excess risk of about 3 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 2003</LINK>). In the UK women aged 25 to 50 are invited for screening every three years and those aged 50 to 64 every five years. Each year, around 3.5 million women accept screening (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Information-Centre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Information Centre 2010</LINK>) and this has been estimated to prevent up to 3900 cases of cervical cancer and save over 4500 lives annually in UK (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sasieni-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasieni 1996</LINK>). However, despite its effectiveness, the uptake rate of cervical cancer screening by eligible women remains stubbornly below 80% (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Information-Centre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Information Centre 2010</LINK>). Information is needed to establish what can be done to increase this uptake rate, particularly in the 20% of women who are missing out on screening.</P>

Next, using an external estimate of the intracluster coefficient (ICC) a design effect was estimated. Hence, the variance of the effect estimate was inflated.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk Factor Assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (n = 1590 in total) evaluated risk factor assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 1996</LINK>). Both used an enhanced risk factor assessment that involved a personally tailored assessment and discussion with the health care provider about the woman's personal risk factors for developing cervical cancer. Both interventions were based on theoretical models of behaviour, the Social Cognitive Theory and Motivational Interviewing Methods (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>) and the Health Belief Model (<LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 1996</LINK>), with a view to changing behaviour to increase the uptake of Pap smears. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>) compared the intervention (n = 97) to usual care (n = 79) whereas the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 1996</LINK>) (n = 1317, 206/1317 analysed) compared the intervention to a no intervention control group (<LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 1996</LINK>).

<P>The cluster RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Byles-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Byles 1996</LINK> reported results of a mass mailing campaign to promote screening.

Significant increases in screening rates were observed in those receiving a personalised letter with the initial invitation.</P>
<P>Similarly the <LINK REF="STD-Byles-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Byles 1995</LINK> cluster RCT assessed the effectiveness of two direct mail strategies to encourage women to have Pap smears compared to a control. The two strategies were assessed in two geographically separated postal regions in Australia. The first intervention consisted of a personally addressed letter providing basic information about Pap smears, information on screening, advice, lists of local providers and an invitation to enrol with free Pap reminder service. The second intervention, in addition to the letter, included a multi-faceted intervention package designed to address a number of factors associated with screening behavior. The effectiveness of each strategy was assessed using a multiple group time-series design involving three postal regions. Both interventions resulted in statistically significant increases in attendances for screening over the post intervention period (42.2% in the region receiving the simple prompt and 39.6% in the region receiving the multi-faceted approach).</P>
<P>The cluster RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Ornstein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ornstein 1991</LINK> assessed the effectiveness of three interventions that aimed to encourage uptake of various screening/vaccine sessions, including a Pap smear.

The authors concluded that computer based physician and patient reminder systems improved adherence to preventive services in primary care settings. In this one year study, a statistically significant decline in Pap smear adherence was confined to the physician reminder group. Small, inconsistent declines in adherence occurred in all four groups. These declines were significant only for white women. (comparison 1.1.4).</P>

A trial of each television media intervention was carried out in three postal regions in New South Wales - a rural locality, a country town and a major rural centre. Three control regions were selected to be demographically similar to the corresponding regions. Television media alone was associated with a significant increase in attendances for screening in the rural centre. The media/letter based campaign was associated with a significant increase in attendances in the rural locality and rural centre. The media/GP based campaign was associated with significant increases in attendances in all three regions. All three interventions were associated with significant increases in the number of women attending for screening above those observed in the control regions. Furthermore, these increases were not restricted to women at low risk. They were also found for older women (aged 50 to 69 years) and women who had not had a Pap smear within the past three years.</P>

Women in the usual care group were more likely to schedule an appointment for a Pap smear than those who received the cognitive behavioural intervention (usual care = 79% versus cognitive behavioural intervention = 37%, P &lt; 0.0001).

The following number of women responders said they had read the material sent: 1. 147 (69%); 2. 128 (75%) letter, 7 (4%) card, 101 (59%) pamphlet; control (not applicable).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Costs of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>Five trials (n = 7718 participants in total) presented cost data (<LINK REF="STD-Binstock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Binstock 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McDowell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDowell 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oscarsson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oscarsson 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 2003</LINK>). The first trial used five different intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Binstock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Binstock 1997</LINK>). However only those groups that used an intervention aimed at women (and not healthcare providers) were included in this review: telephone invitation, invitation letter, and a control group. The total estimated costs ($US) per intervention group were as follows: telephone invitation $4282, invitation letter $1918, memo to primary provider $8933, medical record reminder $1090 and control group (not stated). In terms of the uptake of screening tests invitation letters produced a greater increase compared with invitation letters or the control group.</P>
<P>The second trial used four different intervention groups, but again not all of the interventions were aimed solely at women, some were aimed at healthcare providers (<LINK REF="STD-McDowell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDowell 1989</LINK>). The following groups were considered in this review: GP letter invitation, telephone invitation, and control (usual care). The estimated costs ($US) per additional Pap smear performed as compared with usual care were: GP invitation letter $14.23, telephone intervention $11.75 (assuming a salary of $60) or $5.88 (assuming a salary of $30 per hour).</P>
<P>The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2005</LINK> used four different intervention groups: No intervention (Control); telephone intervention; letter from Health Authority District Cervical Screening Commisioner on behalf of National Cervical Screening Programme and letter from a well known journalist and broadcaster.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 11:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Overall, invitations and educational interventions appeared to be the most effective methods of increasing the absolute uptake of cervical screening. However, heterogeneity between the trials limited the statistical pooling of data. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of other interventions such as economic incentives, procedural interventions (i.e. revealing the gender of the smear taker and using a health promotion nurse), counselling and risk factor assessment was limited by the number of included trials and their moderate or high risk of bias. Furthermore, statistical pooling of the data were often limited by the presence of substantial heterogeneity between the trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Invitations</HEADING>
<P>In general, invitation letters were effective at encouraging women to attend for a Pap smear. Cervical cancer screening programmes in the UK, Italy, Sweden and other countries already invite women to attend via a letter, with or without appointments, as part of their national call/recall system. However, the use of such systems in developing countries may be difficult to implement where issues of migration, literacy and access to remote areas may be of concern.</P>
<P>There was also some limited evidence that telephone invitations increased uptake, but it was unclear whether this practice was more effective than invitation letters. Telephone invitations are not routinely used in organised screening programmes such as that in the UK and would be even more difficult to implement in developing countries where access to telephones may be an issue. It was also unclear as to whether sending invitation letters with appointments was any more effective than sending invitation letters alone. However, there was some evidence to suggest that invitation letters with fixed appointments were more effective than invitations with open appointments.</P>
<P>Current practice in the UK and a number of other countries involves sending invitation letters both from GPs and/or Health Authorities (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Information-Centre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Information Centre 2010</LINK>). The effectiveness of sending letters from different authority sources was evaluated in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segnan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segnan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2005</LINK>). All of these trials favoured GP/local authority letters over other sources. It is not possible to say definitively which approach was more effective, due to the limited evidence from good quality trials. No trial showed a cost-effectiveness benefit of any alternative invitation method over the standard care (usually a letter). Given the effectiveness of invitation letters in encouraging uptake and that no other intervention has been shown to be more cost effective, it remains appropriate to use existing invitation approaches. It must be recognised that for this approach to be effective, robust administrative procedures must be in place and a comprehensive, accurate, up-to-date register maintained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Education</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient evidence in the form of statistically significant findings from good quality trials to support any particular educational intervention, but overall the consensus from the trials examining educational interventions was in favour of the intervention over the no intervention/usual care control. However, heterogeneity between the trials limited the statistical pooling of data. Amongst ethnic minority groups there appeared to be some limited evidence to support the use of lay members of the community in presenting culturally-tailored information, particularly when performed "face-to-face". This may be of relevance in developing countries where remote areas and literacy may be an issue. However, the findings may vary according to ethnic group and further research is required.</P>
<P>Educational materials are likely to be important in increasing informed uptake, providing they cover all aspects of the screening process. For example, the Department of Health in the UK has produced a leaflet emphasising the risks and benefits and this should be included with every invitation for screening (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-CSP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CSP 2009</LINK>). No trials have attempted to measure the effectiveness of interventions at increasing the informed uptake of Pap smears.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intensive recruitment attempts</HEADING>
<P>Although only examined in a single trial, intensive recruitment techniques, including telephone interviews, letters and other promotive efforts showed a promising increase in uptake. However, the cost per extra smear gained (151.36&#8364;) may limit the wider application of this approach.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-02-08 15:21:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future intervention trials should aim to minimise barriers to uptake amongst those who choose screening, based on a full understanding of the likely benefits, limitations and potential harm. Trials should include a measure of knowledge and whether the information provided is used in the decision making process. Just as an intervention to increase uptake may be ineffective, an intervention to increase informed uptake might also be ineffective. For example, it should not be assumed that giving a leaflet on the risks and benefits of screening will necessarily increase informed uptake. It may be that some interventions, which are effective for increasing uptake (such as appointments), are not effective at increasing informed uptake, and the opposite may also be true. Similarly interventions which are effective in developed countries may not be as effective in developing countries or may present problems in terms of their implementation. At present the evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions is dominated by studies set in developed countries and there is a need for research which is likely to be more applicable to developing nations. Future trials should also consider ongoing changes in screening technology. As new screening tests become available their potential effects on participation levels in cervical screening programmes should be considered. At present randomised controlled trials are underway to assess the effectiveness of HPV testing and its likely role in the UK cervical screening programme. However, it has been suggested that the introduction of this test may adversely effect the screening uptake rates because of the connotation of sexual promiscuity attached to a positive HPV test/abnormal Pap smear.</P>
<P>Research into screening uptake including the uptake of Pap smears is still expanding with new studies being published each year. However, at present there is very little research relevant to developing countries and it is difficult to state with any degree of certainty how effective the interventions discussed in this review will be in such settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-03-08 12:32:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The review and the findings of the review are very much dependent on the validity and quality of the 38 trials reported. The risk of bias of the individual trials included in the review was assessed independently by two review authors using pre-defined checklists. Although a number of the trials were of reasonable quality and only at moderate risk of bias, a number of remaining trials suffered from methodological problems and inadequate reporting. With regards to the latter attempts were made to contact authors to clarify various points, but replies were not received in a number of trials. Of note, several trials would have been eligible if proper randomisation procedures had been followed rather than using quasi-randomisation techniques. A number of trials randomised women without first assessing their eligibility so leading to the exclusion of large numbers of women post-randomisation. Many trials also failed to use appropriate analyses such as intention to intervene analyses and the appropriate consideration of the effects of clustering in cluster randomised trials. By not adequately accounting for the potential effects of clustering data from a number of trials it was not available for inclusion in the summary of relative risk values.</P>
<P>Even though risk ratios were calculated in most of the RCTs included in this review, the pooling of data was restricted because of clinical heterogeneity. Of the meta-analyses that could be performed there was quite often substantial statistical heterogeneity present. The conclusions and implications for practice are primarily based on those interventions for which there was evidence from several RCTs, i.e. invitations and educational materials. However, issues of heterogeneity and study quality should be borne in mind when interpreting these findings. A number of trials looked at other interventions but these were often either limited in number, were of questionable validity or both. To increase informed uptake, future interventions should include information on the likely harms and risks, as well as the benefits of screening. These trials should include a measure of knowledge and whether this knowledge was used in the decision to undergo screening. Furthermore, more trials are needed which target ethnic minority groups and other groups where uptake is low.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-02-08 15:21:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The comprehensive search strategy used in the review is likely to have located most of the published trials and our thorough search of the grey literature meant that every attempt had been made to obtain data from unpublished trials. Decisions on the relevance of trials were made by two reviewers in a two stage sifting process. Titles and abstracts of the search results were initially searched, then full articles were sifted of potentially relevant papers identified from the initial sift. In cases of disagreement, a third reviewer was called to decide on disputed trials. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and other non-RCTs, hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility for most outcomes as most comparisons of the interventions were restricted to either a meta analysis of only a low number of trials or single trial analyses. However, the analysis of invitations versus control did not suggest that publication bias was likely to be a problem. It is acknowledged that although abstracts, full articles and unpublished reports were found (through contacting experts in the field and searching the grey literature and reference lists), some may have been missed, but this risk of publication bias is likely to be minimal.</P>

<P>A meta-analysis performed by <LINK REF="REF-Tseng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tseng 2001</LINK> showed that women who received a reminder letter to attend for cervical screening were significantly more likely to attend (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.80) than those who received no intervention. This is in agreement with the findings of this Cochrane review. A meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Yabroff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yabroff 2003</LINK> agrees with the findings of this review that letter reminders and telephone reminders are effective at increasing cervical screening uptake. The findings of this review are also in agreement with the conclusion of <LINK REF="REF-Yabroff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yabroff 2003</LINK> that media interventions do not lead to increased Papanicolou smear use and the finding that peer or lay health worker interventions may have a marginal, though not statistically significant benefit. However, this review is not in agreement with their conclusion that "telephone reminder was associated with the largest increase in Papanicolou smear use". Whilst this review shows telephone reminders to be effective, reminder letters with a fixed appointment appeared to be more so.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-09 11:08:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was sufficient evidence from good quality RCTs to support the use of invitation letters in increasing the uptake of Pap smears. There was also some evidence to suggest that educational interventions may increase Pap smear uptake. Overall, educational materials appeared promising, but it is unclear without evidence from additional good quality RCTs which methods (i.e. printed, video/slide or face to face presentations) are most effective. A number of other interventions including revealing the gender of the smear taker and using a health promotion nurse appeared to be promising approaches, but their effectiveness was only examined in a limited number of trials. Likewise interventions by lay health workers appear to be promising in improving uptake, although the number of trials in this area is limited. There was no evidence on which to base implications for practice regarding the informed uptake of cervical screening. Overall, these findings relate to screening in developed countries and their relevance to developing countries is unclear.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-08 15:38:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The following implications are likely to be relevant to screening in developed countries:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Invitations and educational materials appear to be effective at increasing uptake of cervical cancer screening. Further research into the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of these interventions would help to inform decision-making. In particular it is unclear which types of educational intervention are the most effective.</LI>
<LI>Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of promising interventions such as revealing in an invitation letter the gender of the smear taker, using a health promotion nurse, the use of lay outreach health workers and intensive attempts at recruitment.</LI>
<LI>When designing and reporting future trials researchers should pay particular attention to the following issues: the use of an adequate method of randomisation, the blinding of those assessing study outcome measures, adequate concealment of treatment allocation, adequate follow-up of all participants included in the initial randomisation process, selective reporting of outcomes, and the use of appropriate analyses, particularly in the case of cluster RCTs. Researchers should also try to ensure the enrolment of adequate numbers of eligible participants and interventions should be reported in sufficient detail.</LI>
<LI>A group of women who attend for smears that are particularly at risk are those with inadequate or abnormal smears. Further research should examine the effectiveness of various methods to ensure adequate attendance at follow up for abnormal smears.</LI>
<LI>A concentrated effort should be made to conduct good quality trials in developing countries. In these areas, there is usually no national screening programme, cervical screening is often non-existent and Pap smear or liquid based cytology are not practical. In such situations, other screening modalities such as visual inspection with acetic acid have been shown to acceptable, feasible and safe (<LINK REF="REF-Sankaranarayanan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankaranarayanan 2004</LINK>) and should be considered.</LI>
