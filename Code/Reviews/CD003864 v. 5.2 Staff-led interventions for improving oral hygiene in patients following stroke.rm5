<TITLE>Staff-led interventions for improving oral hygiene in patients following stroke</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:13:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A clean mouth not only feels good but the practice of oral hygiene (removing dental plaque and traces of food) is a crucial factor in maintaining the health of the mouth, teeth and gums. A clean and healthy mouth will also prevent pain or discomfort and allow people to eat a range of nutritious foods. Maintaining good oral hygiene may be difficult after a stroke and healthcare staff may have to assist in providing such care. This review of three studies involving 470 participants found little evidence of how this care is best delivered. Information on a small number of nursing home residents who had a stroke (67 participants from a larger trial) showed that training nursing staff improved their knowledge of oral care and resulted in improved oral hygiene in their patients. Another trial demonstrated the beneficial impact of a decontamination gel on the incidence of pneumonia amongst patients in a stroke ward. However, there was no other information on how best to provide oral hygiene and more studies are urgently needed.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:11:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched April 2010) and Cochrane Oral Health Group (last searched May 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> May 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010), CINAHL (1982 to May 2010), Research Findings Electronic Register (February 2006), National Research Register (Issue 1, 2006), ISI Science and Technology Proceedings (July 2010), Dissertation Abstracts and Conference Papers Index (August 2005), Zetoc (2000 to July 2010) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2000 to July 2010). We scanned reference lists from relevant papers and contacted authors and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:11:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised controlled trials that evaluated one or more interventions designed to improve oral hygiene. We included trials with a mixed population provided we could extract the stroke-specific data.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:11:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently classified trials according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessed the trial quality and extracted data. We sought clarification from study authors when required.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:07:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included three studies involving 470 participants. These trials were of limited comparability evaluating an OHC education training programme, a decontamination gel and a ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle of care augmented with an OHC component by comparing them to a deferred intervention, a placebo gel or standard care respectively. The OHC educational intervention demonstrated a significant reduction in denture plaque scores up to six months (P &lt; 0.00001) after the intervention but not dental plaque. Staff knowledge (P = 0.0008) and attitudes (P = 0.0001) towards oral care also improved. The decontamination gel reduced the incidence of pneumonia amongst the intervention group (P = 0.03).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-03-10 13:39:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Based on two trials involving a small number of stroke survivors, OHC interventions can improve staff knowledge and attitudes, the cleanliness of patients' dentures and reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Improvements in the cleanliness of patients teeth were not observed. Further evidence relating to staff-led oral care interventions is severely lacking.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:17:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For people with limitations due to disabilities caused by neurological conditions such as stroke, the routine practice of oral care presents a considerable challenge. Physical weakness, lack of co-ordination and the cognitive problems that can accompany a stroke may make it impossible for a person to maintain good oral hygiene on their own (<LINK REF="REF-Arai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arai 2003</LINK>). Medication prescribed for patients after stroke may further impact on oral health (<LINK REF="REF-Janket-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janket 2003</LINK>) resulting in, for example, dry mouth, oral ulcers and stomatitis (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-Report-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA Report 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghezzi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghezzi 2000</LINK>). For those with swallowing difficulties, oral clearance may be compromised and medication or nutritional supplements may be administered in a syrup consistency (sugar-based) that further predisposes teeth to dental decay (<LINK REF="REF-Durward-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durward 1997</LINK>). Stroke may change an individual's facial muscles and oral sensation resulting in poorly controlled dentures and altered chewing and oral clearance patterns. Together with swallowing impairment, all these factors impact on an individual's nutritional intake (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2004</LINK>), which in turn has a negative impact on rehabilitation and other functional outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Stroke-Guidelines-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroke Guidelines 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A link between periodontitis and the incidence of stroke has been suggested, indicating that some individuals admitted to a stroke unit may have pre-existing oral health problems (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_rfer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dörfer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scannapieco-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scannapieco 2003</LINK>). After a stroke, many patients are reliant on nursing staff to assist them with oral hygiene. Recent studies have highlighted the poor state of oral health of individuals within supported care (<LINK REF="REF-Hally-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hally 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simons-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1999</LINK>). Despite indications that healthcare staff are interested in improving this aspect of care (<LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>), their knowledge has been found lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 2000</LINK>). Oral care is not perceived as a care priority (<LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 2000</LINK>), is usually delegated to nursing care assistants (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>) and there are few training or care policies in place (<LINK REF="REF-Preston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talbot-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 2000</LINK>). Some nursing staff have even expressed a strong dislike for oral care (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The complementary role that various members of the multidisciplinary stroke team could play in the provision of oral care has been outlined, including dental health, dietetic and occupational therapy professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imm-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imm 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 1998</LINK>). As in other aspects of post-stroke care, rehabilitation goals that aim to maintain or regain independent oral care skills would be appropriate in the stroke care setting (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 2005</LINK>). Current descriptions of oral care interventions incorporate staff knowledge, assessment, equipment, agents, planned intervention, monitored nutritional intake and specialist referral components (<LINK REF="REF-Freer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milligan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milligan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2000</LINK>). However, the dearth of evidence underpinning staff-led oral care practice in health care settings has been highlighted (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milligan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milligan 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>In keeping with current Cochrane Stroke Group guidelines, it was necessary to reduce the number of primary outcomes identified within the protocol to two. We originally listed gingivitis as a primary outcome, but on reflection it was more appropriate to include it as an oral disease outcome, together with denture-induced stomatitis and periodontal disease. We acknowledge that making this post-hoc change following publication of the protocol may lead to bias. We recorded outcome measurements taken up to 12 months post-intervention. We took dental data of included studies at the patient level.</P>

<P>See the 'Specialized register' section in the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/STROKE/frame.html">Cochrane Stroke Group</A> module.</P>
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched April 2010) and the Cochrane Oral Health Group (last searched May 2010). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> May 2010) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010) (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), and CINAHL (1982 to May 2010) (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>). For the previous version of this review we searched the Research Findings Electronic Register (to February 2006), and the National Research Register (Issue 1, 2006) These sources are no longer available and so our search update did not include these.</P>
<P>We developed the search strategy for CINAHL in consultation with the Trials Search Co-ordinators of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Oral Health Group and adapted it for the other databases.</P>
<P>In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing studies we searched ISI Science and Technology Proceedings (July 2010), Dissertation Abstracts and Conference Papers Index (searched August 2005), Zetoc (2000 to 2010) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2000 to July 2010). We scanned reference lists from relevant papers and contacted authors and researchers in the field. We did not handsearch any journals or conference proceedings in addition to those already searched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>We searched for trials in all languages and planned to arrange translation of relevant papers published in languages other then English.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-03-09 04:15:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered investigative trials that addressed staff-led oral care interventions for inclusion on the basis of study design, interventions and outcome measures used. All RCTs that examined oral care interventions for elderly groups (which had the potential to have included individuals post stroke) were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors (DF, MB) screened references generated by the search strategy, with another review author screening a subset of references (up to a publication date of 2002) (VM). We did not identify any additional trials by this repeated screen. Two review authors independently evaluated relevant trials (based on the full texts). They confirmed the inclusion of the study within the review. In some cases we asked the trial authors to provide additional information before we could make a final decision. We resolved conflicting decisions through discussion.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-10-26 14:15:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted details including information on participants, study design, interventions and outcome measures used (MB and DF or RH). For trials based on a mixed population, we contacted the study authors to establish whether the details relating to participants post stroke were available. Stroke-specific data were available for one trial. All data provided was at participant rather than tooth level.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-06-08 14:56:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently coded the methodological quality of included trials by using items specified by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Details recorded included the method of generating the randomisation sequence, allocation concealment and blinding of the outcome assessors. Blinding of participants or staff may only be possible in specific types of oral health care interventions but was recorded where it occurred. We also noted incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, sample size calculations, comparability of groups at baseline, reliability of measures used (inter-, intra-rater, test-retest) and evidence of intention-to-treat analysis (ITT).</P>
<P>We graded the method of generating the randomisation sequence, concealing allocation, blinding and the method of addressing incomplete outcome data within the Risk of Bias tables as 'low risk', 'high risk' and 'unclear risk' of bias. We also gathered information on whether power calculations and ITT analyses were conducted and presented this information within these tables. Where all participants were accounted for in the final results, we have not considered ITT analysis applicable.</P>
<P>We sought clarification from study authors if details were unavailable from the text.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-03-09 02:51:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We grouped trials in terms of their interventions and outcomes and planned subgroup analyses when appropriate. If we included cluster RCTs we planned to identify the unit of randomisation, the unit of analysis and, wherever possible, the intra-class correlation coefficient in order to adjust results to account for cluster effect. We planned to use the Peto odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) for ordinal scales (10 or more categories) and for continuous data. If different scales were used in different trials, we planned to use standardised mean differences (SMD). For non-normal data and ordinal scales with fewer than 10 categories, we planned to use a defined cut off and to treat the data as a binary outcome. We planned sensitivity analyses based on the method of randomisation, extent of allocation concealment at randomisation and presence of assessor blinding.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:40:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We intended to assess heterogeneity between trials using the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>calculations available in the Cochrane Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) (significance level = P &lt; 0.1). If statistical heterogeneity existed (in the absence of co-existing clinical or methodological heterogeneity) then we planned to use a random-effects model to pool the trials. We would use a fixed-effect model if there was no evidence of clinical, methodological or statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>We have included a total of three trials in this updated review: one from the original review (<LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK>) and two identified in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK>). All evaluated the impact of OHC interventions on the oral health of individuals following a stroke. Two randomised a total of 548 individual patients (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK>), while the third employed a cluster randomised design, randomising 22 nursing homes (<LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>One delivered an OHC intervention within a complex 'bundle' of care (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK>), another an OHC educational intervention ((<LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK>), while the third evaluated the impact of a decontamination gel following stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK>). These interventions were compared with standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK>), a deferred intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK>) or a placebo intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK>). Two were conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK>), while the third was based in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK> evaluated an intervention that aimed to reduce the incidence of pneumonia amongst individuals who were ventilated following stroke. The experimental intervention included an OHC extension to the standard ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle of care. The OHC component of the VAP bundle of care included a training session for staff, a protocol for regular OHC every eight hours and an OHC assessment every 12 hours. The OHC intervention was compared to the standard VAP bundle of care based on the number of VAPs. Unfortunately, the trial was terminated early as the incidence of VAP dropped to nil over a period of six months. The study report did not include any suitable data which would permit inclusion of the trial within a meta-analysis and attempts to contact the author have thus far been unsuccessful.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK> recruited 22 nursing homes (with 20 to 40 beds) into the cluster RCT to evaluate an oral health care (OHC) education training programme delivered to nursing home care assistants. The training included a description of the role of plaque in oral disease, and a demonstration of cleaning techniques for dentures and natural teeth (including a practical session). The care assistants that attended training received an oral care booklet and a course attendance certificate. The control group provided usual care and were provided with the training intervention after the trial was complete. A self-administered questionnaire was used to test the care givers' knowledge (26 true or false statements) and attitudes to oral care (response to 25 statements using a Likert 1 to 5 scale, from strongly agree to strongly disagree).</P>

<P>Residents with significant cognitive impairment were excluded from the trial. All measures were taken at baseline (two months prior to training) and one and six months after training. Of the 412 individuals recruited, 337 completed the trial, of which 67 had a history of stroke.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of a 500 mg application of a decontamination gel applied to patients' oral mucous membranes four times daily when compared to a similar procedure using a placebo gel. The interventions were delivered to 203 participants who had experienced a stroke. Patients with dysphagia (swallowing impairment) were given the intervention over three weeks, while those who did not have dysphagia received the treatment over a two-week period. Outcome measures taken included infection (septicaemia and pneumonia) and colonisation by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-03-10 13:40:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The results of three approaches to the delivery of an OHC intervention are presented below in the following comparison groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: OHC training intervention versus standard care</HEADING>
<P>The results for this comparison are presented in relation to nursing home residents' oral health (dental plaque, denture plaque, gingivitis, and denture-induced stomatitis) at one and six months following the training. Data relating to the care assistants outcomes is presented in the following section. Of 412 nursing home residents participating in the <LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK> trial, data from 67 individuals post stroke were available (training intervention: 40 individuals; control (that is, delayed training): 27 individuals). Availability of residents varied over the duration of the trial (baseline: 55 residents; one month after training: 57 residents; six months after training: 53 residents).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 1.1: Dental plaque</HEADING>
<P>(1.1.1) There was no evidence of a difference between the percentage of dental plaque tooth coverage observed amongst the residents whose carers had been offered training and those whose carers had not yet received training (DMS -0.25, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.28).<BR/>(1.1.2) Six months after the carers' oral education intervention, dental plaque scores were similar for the two groups of residents (DMS -0.43, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.13).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 1.2: Denture plaque</HEADING>
<P>(1.2.1) One month after training the residents in the homes that had received the intervention were found to have less plaque on their dentures than those residents that were receiving usual oral care (DMS -1.31, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.66, P &lt; 0.0001).<BR/>(1.2.2) This difference could still be observed six months after the training intervention (DMS -1.57, 95% CI -2.23 to -0.92, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 1.3: Gingivitis</HEADING>
<P>(1.3.1) The severity of gingivitis was measured one month after the training, but there was no evidence of a difference in gingivitis between the groups (DMS -0.05, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.39).<BR/>(1.3.2) Similarly, at six months after training there was no significant difference in gingivitis between the groups (DMS -0.25, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.10).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 1.4: Denture-induced stomatitis</HEADING>
<P>(1.4.1) The severity of denture-induced stomatitis did not differ between the two groups of post-stroke residents one month after the intervention (DMS -0.33, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.26).<BR/>(1.4.2) Nor was there evidence of a difference between the groups' denture-induced stomatitis six months after training (DMS -0.10, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.40).</P>
<P>Data included in the review reflect the knowledge and attitude of all care assistants employed within the nursing homes at the data collection points including those that started their employment after the training intervention. Thus the impact of a training intervention delivered in a care setting with a characteristically high rate of staff turnover was reflected in the results. Not all available care assistants chose to participate in the training or to return a completed questionnaire (baseline = 80.5%; one month post training = 81.1%; six months post training = 77.2%). The number of care assistants employed varied (baseline: 369 assistants; one month after training: 322 assistants; six months after training: 289 assistants). For each outcome, data at one month and six months after training are presented.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 1.5: Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>(1.5.1) One month after the oral care educational intervention the care assistants that received the training had higher knowledge scores than the group that had the delayed intervention (MD 1.31, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.15, P = 0.002).<BR/>(1.5.2) This difference could still be observed six months after training (MD 1.38, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.18, P = 0.0008).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 1.6: Attitude</HEADING>
<P>(1.6.1) The nursing home care assistants that received the training had a significantly better attitude to oral care (as judged by rating 25 oral health statements on a Likert-scale) than the group that had training delayed (MD 4.45, 95% CI 1.79 to 7.11, P = 0.001).<BR/>(1.6.2) This difference was still observed six months after training (MD 6.04, 95% CI 3.23 to 8.85, P = 0.0001).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: OHC decontamination gel versus placebo gel</HEADING>
<P>The results for this comparison are presented in relation to the trial participants' general and oral health (infection and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB)). Data from all 203 randomised participants were available from the <LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK> trial although full follow-up data was only available for 164 individuals.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 2.1: Infection</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2.1.1) Pneumonia</HEADING>
<P>Those participants that received the decontamination gel (103 participants) had fewer incidences of pneumonia (one incident) over the course of the trial period than those that used the placebo gel (100 participants; seven incidents of pneumonia) (OR 0.20, CI 95% 0.05 to 0.84, P = 0.03).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2.1.2) Septicaemia</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of septicaemia between the two groups (three incidences in both groups) (OR 0.97, CI 95% 0.19 to 4.91).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome 2.2: Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2.2.1) Acquired AGNB</HEADING>
<P>A total of 37 individuals acquired AGNB following admission with stroke. There was no evidence of a difference between the group that were using the decontamination gel (14 participants) and those in the placebo group (23 participants) (OR 0.53, CI 95% 0.26 to 1.09).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2.2.2) Carriage of AGNB</HEADING>
<P>Similarly, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in relation to carriage of AGNB (OR 0.90, CI 95% 0.42 to 1.92).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: OHC complex intervention versus standard care</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK> compared two 'bundles' of care designed to reduce VAP amongst patients who were ventilated following a stroke. One approach included an OHC component within the bundle. The OHC intervention included an educational package, a protocol of OHC, an OHC assessment every 12 hours and an OHC kit. Outcome data were not reported and so the trial cannot be included within a meta-analysis. The trial was terminated after six months as the incidence of VAP was reduced to zero within the experimental group over the trial period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>As such disparate trials were included in the review, we had no opportunity to conduct the sensitivity analyses planned at the protocol stage.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-09 03:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the conduct and (in some cases) publication of several new trials in this field since the original review, there remains a lack of high quality evidence to inform OHC practice in stroke care settings. From our original review we know that <LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK> demonstrated that an OHC educational training intervention targeted at healthcare staff had a positive impact not only on staff knowledge and attitudes but also had a beneficial effect on their patients' oral hygiene. One month after training, residents had less plaque on their dentures than those residents in the homes where training was delayed. Disappointingly, the training intervention was not seen to have made a difference to the residents' intra-oral health (in terms of dental plaque and gingivitis measures) at either assessment point. As improvements in the provision of oral care outside of the mouth, such as cleaning of removable dentures, was noted to improve but intra-oral care did not, it is likely that despite training, the healthcare staff continued to experience some barriers to the provision of oral care within the mouth (<LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>). The results of the study do give some encouragement however, as the benefits of the oral care training intervention (as measured by denture plaque) were still evident six months after the intervention, despite the characteristically high staff turnover rates in nursing home settings.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK> found that individuals using a gel for selective decontamination of the digestive tract had a lower incidence of pneumonia, while <LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK> similarly reports a drop in the incidence of pneumonia following a comprehensive and frequent OHC routine amongst a ventilated stroke population. The quality of the <LINK REF="STD-Fields-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 2008</LINK> trial is difficult to judge because the trial was terminated early and very little information is provided in the published report. <LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK>, in contrast, evaluated the effectiveness of a highly specific OHC intervention across a wide stroke population, including those that were unable to consent. Some patients were excluded, including those with a prior stroke and those receiving antibiotic or steroid medication. Neither of these studies had conducted an ITT analysis and <LINK REF="STD-Gosney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gosney 2006</LINK> did not conduct an a-priori sample size calculation.</P>
<P>Of the trials eligible for inclusion in this review, eight trials were unable to provide stroke-specific data. Of these, five investigated oral healthcare programme interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Hajizamani-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hajizamani 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mojon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mojon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quagliarello-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Quagliarello 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redwood-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Redwood 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schou-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schou 1989</LINK>), two examined the use of medicated gum (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2002</LINK>) and one a varnish (<LINK REF="STD-Brailsford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brailsford 2002</LINK>). While <LINK REF="STD-Frenkel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frenkel 2001</LINK> found the oral healthcare programme resulted in benefits to the patients, not all programme interventions had such positive effects. It appears likely that the differing results from these programmes may be related in part to their target populations, content, manner of delivery and support. Gum and varnish interventions were noted to have modest effects.</P>
<P>We also noted a large number of commentary or descriptive pieces in our systematic review of the literature, relating to the in-house development of an oral care tool conducted and reported by healthcare staff. Such enthusiasm and commitment to improving standards conflicts with the perception of staff apathy that might be inferred from descriptions of poor oral care procedures or reports of poor oral hygiene in care settings.</P>
<P>While the attitudes of nursing and healthcare staff to oral care appear to vary (<LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>), the provision of oral care for dependent patients is viewed as a core nursing responsibility (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-W_x00e5_rdh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wårdh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weeks-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeks 1994</LINK>). Nursing staff, however, are frustrated by restricted training opportunities, access to equipment, assessment tools and professional dental support (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weeks-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeks 1994</LINK>). What tools and protocols are available are based on limited evidence. With limited availability of support it is not surprising that oral care provision is not perceived as a priority. Good oral health is essential to optimise an individual's speech, nutritional intake, systemic health, rehabilitative outcomes and quality of life. It is therefore crucial that oral care is given greater priority in stroke care settings and that staff are supported in their delivery of this care.</P>
<P>In reviewing the literature, we were disappointed to find little mention of the specific rehabilitative nature oral care provision might take in the stroke care setting. Similarly, only passing reference was made to the possibility of involving the wider multidisciplinary team (such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dieticians, speech and language therapists) and informal carers in the planning or delivery of supported oral care (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imm-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imm 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 1998</LINK>). One of the core strengths of specialist stroke care is the rehabilitative setting facilitated by the stroke specialist multidisciplinary team (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2003</LINK>). The proven benefits of this environment should be utilised in the provision of oral care post stroke. The maintenance of a patient's oral hygiene should be given higher priority (in research and clinical settings) given the wide reaching implications poor oral hygiene has on an individual's oral health and, in turn, recovery post stroke.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-03-09 03:54:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a paucity of high-quality evidence relating to oral care interventions for individuals after a stroke. What little evidence is available suggests that even an hour-long training session delivered by a dental health professional can change healthcare staff's knowledge of and attitude towards administering oral care and may have a positive impact on patients' oral hygiene as measured by denture cleanliness. There is some evidence that, despite an attendance rate of only two-thirds of the healthcare staff and a high staff turnover rate characteristic of such settings, the benefits of training were not only retained but appeared to be successfully transferred to new members of staff.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-09 03:55:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence presented within this review indicates the potential benefits of training on denture care and staff knowledge and the benefits of decontamination gel on the incidence of pneumonia, but further investigation is needed to identify the optimum OHC intervention that will benefit oral health. In addition, trials of high quality are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of other OHC interventions amongst the post-stroke population. These might be based in community, hospital or other residential settings. Specific goals within a rehabilitation setting might, for example, progress from oral care that is dependent on a carer, to supported oral care, to the eventual goal of independent oral care. While the evidence identified in this review relates to a training programme and a decontamination gel, trials that evaluate the effectiveness of the various oral care assessment tools, agents, equipment or oral hygiene promotion packages currently available within stroke care settings are urgently needed to fill the evidence gap that sadly exists in this area. Long-term follow-up should also be considered to capture information relating to the need for repeated training or other intervention updates.</P>
<P>We would urge anyone aiming to address the effectiveness of an oral care intervention to consider using a RCT design. Given the complexity of oral care provision, we acknowledge that evaluating oral care provision using a randomised or cluster randomised trial design is likely to be a complex undertaking. However, in a study that aims to successfully deliver and evaluate the effectiveness of a complex OHC intervention, it is vital to employ methods that ensure the exclusion of as much bias as possible.</P>
