We are a bit confused ourselves by your last comments concerning the effect of adequate blinding on the results. The results did not change since the version of the review that we send you last December, i.e. we did not provide any additional data. At that time, our interpretation of results was rather cautious due to the low reported methodological quality of the trials. See our implications for research of the December version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The validity of this systematic review indicating a benifical effect of Ketotifen for the control of asthma in children with asthma and/or wheeze is limited by the low methodological quality of the included trials. To give a definite answer on the efficacy of Ketotifen compared to placebo a randomized controlled trial with the following characteristics should be performed:&lt;br&gt; - adequately concealed, randomised and double-blind trial of reasonable size&lt;br&gt; - intervention: Ketotifen given at a daily dose not less than 1mg for at least 8 weeks compared to placebo&lt;br&gt; - co-interventions: rescue beta2-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids&lt;br&gt; - inclusion criteria: children suffering from mild to moderate asthma according to established international guidelines&lt;br&gt; - primary outcome: consumption of co-medications (change from baseline)&lt;br&gt; - reporting of trial results according to CONSORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the following questions should be examined:&lt;br&gt; - Ketotifen versus DNCG in children with mild and to moderate asthma&lt;br&gt; - steroid sparing effect of Ketotifen in children with moderate to severe asthma&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We changed this conclusion according to your previous comments during the revision of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there is a discrepancy in some outcomes between adequate and unclear blinded trials we do not think that the whole conclusion and implications for practice need to be changed for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- results for trials with adequate blinding are significant for primary outcome 03 and secondary outcome 16, i.e. there are favourable effects of ketotifen (this was not explicitly written in the text before since we thought the forest plots are sufficient, but is now included in the Discussion)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- a common pattern (larger effects for trials with unclear blinding) is seen for outcomes 06, 10, 13, and 20, however, the heterogeneity test is significant only for outcome 06&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- all trials with unclear blinding are described as randomised, double-blind controlled trials in the publications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we think that the implications for practice have not to be changed (especially since Ketotifen appears to have only minor side effects). We would suggest to add a statement that a large randomized controlled trial is needed to give a definite answer on the efficacy of Ketotifen compared to placebo in the implications for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal decision is whether the conclusions should be based only on the result of trials reported as adequately blinded or on all trials included in the review. We think that information of all trials should be considered and used the test of heterogeneity as an indication whether trials with adequate and unclear blinding can be summarized in a single treatment estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would suggest that you revise the text of the review as far as you think it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yours, Guido and Dirk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hi Dirk and Guido,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks for carefully reviewing this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;you have addressed all my points. thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I am confused now with the overall interpretation of the findings. With the additional data provided, it seems that for well-blinded trials, the data do not show any favourable effect of ketotifen. Adequate blinding show no SS for the main outcome (that was clear before) and, as you now say in the discussion (one before last paragraph of discussion), no SS effect in the evaluation of treatment efficacy by MD (outcome 10), by patients/parents (13), by use of oral steroids (outcome 20). In the results section , however, there is no report of the effect disappearing with blinding, only that the x2 for heterogeneity is non significant. I am confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would clearly believe the results of blinded and well randomised trials more than the others. If there is a significant effect of blinding/methodology quality on the main outcome, I would separately report the secondary outcomes by methodological quality (jadad 4-5 vs 1-3) and derive my conclusion from high quality trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;did i missunderstand something? Please clarify. If my understanding is right, the whole conclusion, implications for practice and research need to be changed. If i'm wrong, then the review should be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am cc this to Chris as the issue will come up again for sure with external reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;francine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p.s. will return your next reply within 96 hours - unless you send it after June 26 (when I will be gone for 3 weeks); i would then ask Chris to take over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Francine,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks again for replying so fast! We carefully considered all your comments. Whenever it was just a question of wording we did not highlight the text anymore.&lt;br&gt;In the case of substantial changes, they are highlighted in red color. For the point to point reply, please see below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;description of studies&lt;br&gt;1. why was Poder's study excluded on the basis of absence of double-blinding if it's not mentioned as exclusion criteria; particularly when methods of blinding were not described in other included studies? Either include study or add report of double-blinding as pre-requisite for inclusion .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Included studies have to be double blinded, we clarified this in the &amp;quot;Types of studies&amp;quot; (highlighted in red). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.some unclear sentences are highlighted in red followed by ??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---We clarified these unclear sentences (not highlighted in red anymore)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. list the type of outcome not considered in this review that resulted in the exclusion of Graff, Lonnevig and Rebman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Listed in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.the 2 cross-over studies: Loftus and volovitz can now be included with Revman 4.2. , although preferably in a separate comparison &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---We describe the problems with these studies in detail in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Result&lt;br&gt;PRIMARY OUTCOME-end of 1st para: &lt;br&gt;confirm definition of infants&amp;lt;1 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---We describe the definition of age groups in detail in section &amp;quot;Methods of the review&amp;quot; (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;why are you referring to trials with inadequate blinding if they were excluded?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---We renamed the subgroup &amp;quot;Inadequate/Unclear&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Unclear&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;SECONDARY OUTCOMES&lt;br&gt;same comment for additional medication re: blinding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---See above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;SIDE EFFECTS&lt;br&gt;(-add some indication of baseline weight or age so the reader can interpret the clinical significance of this weight gain.&lt;br&gt;report weight gain on same scale ie. kg for all studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Included in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;-ADD UNITS FOR OUTCOMES SUCH AS Bronchodilator consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---We are not sure what you mean. The units for bronchodilator consumption are given in the text, e.g. &amp;quot;average percentage of days on which a patient took salbutamol up to week 26&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;-theophylline is spelled with a &amp;quot;h'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---O.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;br&gt;We are left with one important question that could not be answered due to the poor reporting of studies: the conclusion apply to what severity level? An alternative way to address this question is to look at the definition of exacerbation and the rate of exacerbation in the control group. Now some studies show over 80% rate of exacerbations in the control group, suggesting either liberal definition of exacerbation or more severe asthma. is there any way that you can order the studies with respect to the primary outcomes only, by exacerbation rate in the control group (using the user-defined order) or by use of rescue oral steroids in the control group (although I am aware that it was less often used in the 1980 than in the 1990).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Described in detail in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;subgroup analysis by age may be confounded by severity. Would address severity first before age or say that the two could not be clearly distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Described in detail in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;another unresolved issue is the magnitude of effect when ketotifen is used as monotherapy vs. add-on to theophylline or inhaled steroids.: could you stratified the analysis on presence or not of co-intervention only for the primary outcome and comment on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Described in detail in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE&lt;br&gt;clear&lt;br&gt;if possible, state if the beneficial effect is apparent whether it is use as monotherapy or add-on therapy. this is very important, as you may know. most nternational consensus guidelines no longer recognised ketotifen as a useful anti-asthmatic Rx. your review would change this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Described in detail in the text (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;RESEARCH&lt;br&gt;I suggest calling for research into 2 areas: you did so: perhaps it would be clearer if indicated in point form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. as monotherapy vs. low dose of inhaled steroids vs LTRA vs cromolyn&lt;br&gt;2. as add-on therapy, to low dose of inhaled steroids with the recent recognition of the flat dose-response curve of inhaled steroids in mild and moderate asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Changed accordingly in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes from Freiburg&lt;br&gt;Dirk and Guido&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am hereby submitting the review on ketotifen for your consideration. You &lt;br&gt;must have seen the latest exchanges with Dirk regarding the interpretation to &lt;br&gt;be given to several outcomes where the effect appeared related to study &lt;br&gt;quality. He has answered my questions satisfactorily. I have re-edited and &lt;br&gt;re-structured the text (moving some description from results to description &lt;br&gt;and moving some results from the discussion to the result section). &lt;br&gt;I am now submitting this review for your consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that I did not have time to complete, would need to be &lt;br&gt;done before sending it to external reviewers:&lt;br&gt;&amp;#216;Spell check&lt;br&gt;&amp;#216;Check uniformity of tense (past vs present)&lt;br&gt;&amp;#216;Check for consistency in titles and subtitles&lt;br&gt;Francine.&lt;br&gt;____________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 20_06_03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: English title missing for Rebmann. Please insert. (FINE)&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies: Good. Please add list of abbreviations to this table. DSCG is the usual abbreviation to cromoglycate and may need changing please. (FINE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Graph labels need to be reversed for Outcome 1.3. Outcome 1.8 and 1.11 should be labelled poor overall efficacy (otherwise a lower RR looks as if ketotifen is worse than placebo). (FINE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: I have taken out the implications for research as this is too long as it stands. We will get feedback from a consumer on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Tenses changed to be all past tense.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think you at least need to mention the problem in relation to the higher quality trials not showing significant benefit throughout this review....... This is not just a power issue as there is a statistically significant difference between the trials with adequate allocation concealment and those without for use of bronchodilators for example. (ADDITIONS IN RED LOOK FINE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Why divide children at the pre-school point rather than at 2 years to separate trials on wheezy infants from those on children with asthma? This would save the overlapping group and makes much better clinical sense to me. It does not seem to make much difference to the results. (I DO NOT HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ON THIS AND SEE THAT FRANCINE IS KEEN TO KEEP THIS AS IT IS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;quot;Patients with asthma exacerbations were reported in two trials (outcome 17). Both trials report very large and similar treatment effects. The overall relative risk is 0.31 [95% CI: 0.19;0.59] indicating a highly significant beneficial effect of ketotifen in preventing exacerbations.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;This is interesting and raises questions about why ketotifen was so effective. I would like to know about the included studies in terms of atopy, hay fever and other circumstances in which ketotifen would be expected to be of benefit? (THIS STILL NEEDS SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL PLEASE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS POST HOC IT REMAINS IMPORTANT FOR GENERALISABILITY OF THE REVIEW RESULTS, IF THE TRIALS ARE ON ASTHMATICS WHO HAVE HIGH IGE LEVELS OR POSITIVE SKIN TESTS THEY MAY NOT APPLY TO THOSE WHO ARE LESS ALLERGIC FOR EXAMPLE. THIS IS NOT A STATISTICAL ISSUE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: I think publication bias should be mentioned further in your discussion. I think some caution about the generalisability of these results to all asthmatics in view of the number of trials with positive skin tests also needs to be included. This is for commonsense reasons! Antihistamines are commonly used for Hay Fever (which may include wheezing) and are generally regarded as being of benefit so this is a possible confounding factor. I notice that one study stratified for birch pollen reactions. Certainly some studies focus on extrinsic asthma particularly so how strong is the ground for generalising this to intrinsic asthma as well? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewer's conclusions: Implications for research&lt;br&gt;I notice that one of the papers does compare with cromoglycate (Croce) and this comparison is not actually the subject of this review so this implication needs wording carefully. &lt;br&gt;SORRY I HAVE NOT MADE THIS CLEAR. I AM NOT QUESTIONING WHETHER CROCE SHOULD BE INCLUDED, BUT WARNING AGAINST DRAWING A CONCLUSION THAT GOES BEYOND THE REMIT OF THE REVIEW. YOU SUGGEST FURTHER WORK IN AN AREA THAT YOU HAVE EXCLUDED IN YOUR PROTOCOL, SO YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH HAS BEEN DONE IN COMPARISON WITH CROMOGLYCATE. Do you know how much comparative work has been done on this. &lt;br&gt;Do you really mean systemic steroids in your implications for research? &amp;quot;co-interventions: rescue beta-2 agonists and systemic steroids&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues: Definition of asthma in children under 2 is difficult. Some trials say childhood asthma and others wheezy infants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: Ketotifen changed to ketotifen throughout. Also beta2-agonists changed to beta-2 agonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to Francine and authors to relook please.&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Reponse to the changes made and email correspondence on 01_07_2003 by CJC&lt;br&gt;I have fed back on the changes you have made as above. Could I also ask you to relook at the Loftus paper which is a cross-over but comes to negative conclusions. There is a danger of bias if no results from this study are included in the review (as it could be construed as exclusion on the basis of the negative outcome). I am well aware of the problems with cross-overs but numbers of patients needing oral steroids and hospital admission are reported, so at the least this could go into the text even if you do not include it in the meta-analysis...... THIS IS TRICKY I KNOW. Trade-off between statistical correctness and omitting a negative study. Did you specify how you would handle cross-over studies in your protocol by any chance???????&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the reworking of this.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;From: &amp;quot;Chris Cates&amp;quot; &amp;lt;chris@nntonline.net&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;To: &amp;quot;dirk bassler&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dirkbassler@hotmail.com&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;tlassers@sghms.ac.uk&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;francine.ducharme@mcgill.ca&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;Guido.Schwarzer@fdm.uni-freiburg.de&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Subject: RE: kETOTIFEN REVIEW&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Date: Fri, 25 Jul 2003 19:47:42 +0100&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Dirk,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Thanks for checking this. I think you have to modify your conclusions a bit&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and report that some studies had a high proportion of children with atopy &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;so&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the results of the review cannot necessarily be generalised to include all&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;asthmatic children but may apply particularly to those who are atopic as&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;well. Do you have a feel for levels of atopy across the board? I agree that&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;another post-hoc sub-group test is not the way forward, but some caution&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;about how these results are applied may be sensible. This outcome is for &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;two&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;studies with many atopic children and it is not so suprising to me that&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ketotifen is helpful in such children. I think you need to touch on this in&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the abstract, results, discussion and conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris,&lt;br&gt;thanks for your latest helpful comments on the review!&lt;br&gt;I made some additional comments (highlited in red) as you suggested but &lt;br&gt;unfortunately the levels of atopy differ quite a lot throughout the studies &lt;br&gt;and again the information provided is mostly unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please let us all know if there is anything else you want us to revise.&lt;br&gt;Dirk&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;1 Aug 2003 CJC sign off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Evidence from randomised controlled trials indicates that ketotifen alone or in combination with other co-interventions improves control of asthma and wheezing in children with mild and moderate asthma. However due to the high proportion of children with atopy in some trials the results cannot necessarily be generalised to all asthmatic children. The benefit is obtained at the cost of minor side effects, namely sedation and weight gain. The validity of this conclusion is limited by the low reported, methodological quality of included trials.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amended results in the abstract includes caveat on atopy now, I am happy with this and the other amendments. I am happy for this to go forward for peer review now.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Ketotifen alone or as additional medication for long-term control of asthma and wheeze in children&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-06-17 10:06:59 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="KET-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.24" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.2">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Children with asthma can find using inhaled treatments medication difficult and so oral medication such as ketotifen, which is an antihistamine, can be used to help control symptoms. The review found that mild asthma symptoms were well-controlled in the studies of 4 to 32 week duration with reduction in use of rescue bronchodilator, rescue oral steroids and in exacerbations as well as clear perception of effectiveness from physicians, parents and children. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of 26 relevant studies involving 1826 participants were included in this review. Children's age ranged from 4 months to 18 years and ketotifen was given between 10 and 32 weeks. The proportion of children able to reduce or stop their bronchodilator use within 12 to 16 weeks of treatment was significantly higher in the ketotifen group (relative risk 2.39, 95% CI 1.64 to 3.48) based on four trials; this result was statistically significant in a subgroup of two trials with well described and adequate method of blinding. Statistically significant beneficial effects of ketotifen were also observed in the following secondary outcomes: efficacy evaluated by physician (10 trials) and parents/patients (7 trials), asthma symptom score (4 trials), asthma exacerbations (2 trials), and reduction in use of oral steroids (4 trials). However, sub-group analyses of trials with well described and adequate method of blinding was only significant for the outcome asthma symptom score and non-significant for the remaining secondary outcomes. Reported side effects were more frequent in the ketotifen group (sedation: 21%, weight gain: 27%) than in the placebo group (sedation: 12%, weight gain: 17%). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence from randomised controlled trials indicates that ketotifen alone or in combination with other co-interventions improves control of asthma and wheezing in children with mild and moderate asthma. However due to the high proportion of children with atopy in some trials the results cannot necessarily be generalised to all asthmatic children. The benefit is obtained at the cost of minor side effects, namely sedation and weight gain. The validity of this conclusion is limited by the low reported, methodological quality of included trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>With the recognition of the chronic inflammation of the airways present in asthma, anti-inflammatory medication has assumed increasing importance in asthma therapy over recent years. Of these medications inhaled steroids are the most potent and are widely used all over the world (<LINK REF="REF-Pao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2002</LINK>). However, since administering inhaled therapy to younger children can be difficult, an oral agent offers potential advantages. Furthermore inhaled steroids are not completely innocuous: potential serious side effects include suppression of adrenal function, retardation in growth and bone formation (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Ketotifen is an oral medication that may be used for maintenance treatment of asthma. It is an antihistamine whose mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it may inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators, inhibit bronchospasm by reducing calcium uptake in mast cells and in smooth muscle (<LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1988</LINK>). As an oral preparation, ketotifen might be useful in managing children with asthma, especially in the pre-school age. However, because of conflicting trial results, it remains unclear whether oral ketotifen is effective either alone or in combination with other therapies in the management of pediatric asthma. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to determine whether ketotifen alone, or in combination with other co-interventions, results in better control of asthma in children with asthma and/or wheezing and examine its safety profile.</P>

<P>We conducted statistical analyses with RevMan 5 and R, Version 1.7.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ihaka-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ihaka 1996</LINK>). A random effects model was used in all meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, the relative risk (RR) was used to evaluate the treatment effect. Continuous outcomes (i.e. asthma symptom score and bronchodilator consumption) were measured on different scales, therefore, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used in meta-analyses of continuous outcomes. We examined heterogeneity for all outcomes; a p value less than 0.05 was considered indicative of heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Initially we included 27 trials based on criteria for study design, participants and interventions: 24 trials identified from the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and three trials identified by reference checking. Handsearching in nine German medical journals did not reveal any further trials. All trials were described as placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomised but often the method of randomisation and double blinding was not clearly stated. We tried to contact 17 authors to get additional information. Nine (53%) replied to our inquiry: <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poder-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Poder 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loftus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Loftus 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rackham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rackham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myloma-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Myloma 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canny 1997</LINK>. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Poder-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Poder 1982</LINK>) was excluded from the analysis since it was not double-blind (personal communication, Dr. Poder). Accordingly, quality assessment (allocation concealment and Jadad score), data extraction and analysis were done for the remaining 26 trials. The trials have been published between 1982 and 2000 (with 17 publications (65%) before 1990) in 17 different countries (Europe: 14, North America: two, Middle America: one, South America: two, Oceania: three, Asia: four).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The trials were heterogeneous with respect to the age of the participants. All except one trial included patients aged between four months and 18 years. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Croce-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Croce 1995</LINK> included patients between six and 25 years. We decided to include this study due to a mean age of 11.9 years.</P>
<P>Overall, 12 trials (46%) reported data on atopy/extrinsic asthma however with different levels of atopy. Most data were in respect to performed skin and IgE tests and/or a history of atopic symptoms (e.g. urticaria, allergic rhinitis, eczema).</P>
<P>A total of 13 trials (50%) of trials reported data on the duration of illness prior to study entry. However, reported data were either vague (just stating "chronic asthma") or differed widely across trials (with a range of four weeks to four years duration of asthma).</P>
<P>With respect to severity, criteria differed also widely across trials: three trials reported the reversibility in lung function parameters after inhalation of beta-2 agonists (15% to 30% in fixed expiratory flow rate in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)) as a criteria of severity. These data suggest that children included suffered from mild to moderate asthma. Five trials reported the concomitant medication as a criteria of severity. Most of the five trials excluded children on inhaled or systemic steroids, while others required medication with beta-2 agonists and/or xanthines. The concomitant medication allowed in the studies reflects well the time the studies were performed (e.g. none of the studies included anti-leukotrienes) and did not allow to separate between mild, moderate or severe asthma. Other authors just described the children included in their studies as suffering from "mild" or "moderate" asthma. Overall, by the description of studies it is obvious, that from today's point of view, most of the children included in this review suffered from mild to moderate asthma.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The dose of ketotifen administered ranged from 1 mg/d to 4 mg/d; in most trials (16 of 26) 2 mg/d of ketotifen were administered at a uniform dose to all participants. In three trials, 1 mg/d of ketotifen was administered and in the remaining seven trials the dose of ketotifen varied, depending on body weight, age or protocol.</P>
<P>Six trials did not have a run-in phase. In the remaining trials, the run-in period ranged from one to four weeks: one trial had a run-in period of one week, nine trials of two weeks, and 10 trials of four weeks.</P>
<P>The duration of treatment ranged from 10 and 32 weeks: two trials had a treatment period of less than 12 weeks, 15 trials of 12 weeks, five trials of 16 weeks, and four trials had a treatment period of more than 16 weeks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Concomitant medication</HEADING>
<P>A total of 18 trials reported that beta-2 agonists were allowed as co-intervention; in only one of these 18 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1992</LINK>) beta-2 agonists were the only allowed agent for control of asthma, in all other trials further agents were allowed as co-interventions. Furthermore, in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Montoya-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Montoya 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neijens-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Neijens 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1999</LINK>), the use of bronchodilators was allowed without giving detail on specific drugs.

Due to insufficient reporting, it was not possible to distinguish between trials giving beta-2 agonists as maintenance and rescue treatment but it can be assumed that beta-2 agonists were given as rescue medication in most trials.</P>
<P>In 15 trials, theophylline was administered additionally to beta-2 agonists. Inhaled corticosteroids were allowed as additional intervention in eight trials, oral steroids were allowed in 10 trials and cromoglycate was allowed in four trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Trials differed widely in the number of reported outcomes and the definition of outcomes. Accordingly, some of the 12 outcomes considered in this systematic review are either based on a limited number of trials and patients or consist of trials with different outcome definitions.</P>
<P>The main outcome, reduction in bronchodilator use (outcome 01), pertains to the number of participants reducing or discontinuing bronchodilator consumption at the end of the treatment. Four trials provided data this outcome; three trials reported both reduction and discontinuation and one trial only reported reduction of bronchodilator consumption, after 12 weeks (three trials) or 16 weeks (one trial) of treatment. One trial reported reduction in beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Spicak-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spicak 1983</LINK>) while the other three trials reported reduction in bronchodilator use which may include other drugs than beta-2 agonists. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chay 1992</LINK>) had a run-in period of two weeks to compare the use of bronchodilators to, the other three trials did not have a run-in period. Thus, it remains unclear how assessments of reduction in bronchodilators have been done in these three trials.</P>
<P>Other means of reporting the consumption of bronchodilator use were considered as secondary outcomes, namely:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Use of bronchodilators" (outcome 04) summarises the number of participants on concomitant bronchodilator therapy was reported in five trials; three trials contained information on the number of patients using bronchodilators after 12 weeks (two trials) or 16 weeks (one trial) of treatment; the other two trials reported the number of participants using bronchodilators between week 13 and 16 and week 8 and 12 of treatment, respectively. Two trials reported use of beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1993</LINK>) while the other three trials reported use of bronchodilators. </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>"Bronchodilator consumption" (outcome 07) aggregates trials reporting either number of days of bronchodilator use or doses of bronchodilators, which included three trials defining bronchodilator consumption in very different ways: average percentage of days on which a participant took salbutamol up to week 26, number of doses of salbutamol per month after 16 weeks of treatment, difference of the number of times bronchodilators were used at week 4 and 20.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Various side effects were reported in the publications. Sedation, weight gain and withdrawals due to side effects were considered to evaluate the safety of ketotifen. Other side effects like dryness of mouth, increased appetite and somnolence were only reported in two trials. Information on side effects given in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulhern-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mulhern 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1992</LINK>) could not be considered in the analysis since the number of side effects not the number of participants with these side effects was reported.</P>
<P>Five trials are not included in any analysis of this systematic review: two publications (<LINK REF="STD-Graff-Lonnevig-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Graff Lonnevig 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebmann 1987</LINK>) solely reported outcomes not considered in the review (lung function parameters, sensitivity to metacholine), one publication (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1989</LINK>) did not report the necessary measures of variability (e.g. standard errors), two cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Loftus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Loftus 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1988</LINK>) reported neither the results of the first treatment period separately (required to include the studies as parallel group design) nor the necessary measures of variability, i.e. the standard error of the patient-specific treatment differences (required to include the studies as cross-over design).

Although three outcomes on the use of bronchodilators were defined in this review, the primary outcome was the reduction in bronchodilator use after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment. This particular outcome was reported in four trials. Participants treated with ketotifen are more than twice likely to reduce or stop bronchodilator use (relative risk (RR) 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 3.48, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). No heterogeneity was observed. The effect was similar across age groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and appropriateness of blinding (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Visual inspection of funnel plot did not suggest any significant bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Other measures of bronchodilator use were reported and show a similar treatment effect with ketotifen. The number of participants on concomitant bronchodilator therapy (Outcome 04) was reported in five trials; significantly less participants in the ketotifen group used bronchodilators after 8 to 16 weeks of treatment (five trials, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.92). Heterogeneity was apparent (p = 0.0022) and the funnel plot suggested publication bias (p = 0.085). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses show that heterogeneity might be explained either by age (outcome 05, p = 0.0054, chi squared test of between-group heterogeneity) or appropriateness of blinding (outcome 06, p = 0.0007). More specifically, the effect of ketotifen was stronger in school children (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.53], one trial) than in infants/pre-school (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01], four trials). The effect of ketotifen disappeared in trials with adequate blinding (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.22), two trials) as compared to trials with unclear reporting of blinding methods (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.68), three trials). A <I>post-hoc</I> analysis examined the possibility of a differential effect when ketotifen was used as a single versus add-on agent. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1992</LINK>) rescue beta-2 agonists were the only concomitant drug permitted. Additional medication was reported in three studies (theophylline, <LINK REF="STD-de-Benedictis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">de Benedictis 1990</LINK>; steroids, <LINK REF="STD-Santos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1999</LINK>; theophylline and steroids, <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1993</LINK>) and remained unclear for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Neijens-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Neijens 1988</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1992</LINK> showed the smallest treatment effect. However, a subgroup analysis of this study versus the three studies with additional medication (<LINK REF="STD-de-Benedictis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">de Benedictis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1993</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Santos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1999</LINK>) was not significant.</P>
<P>No meta-analysis was conducted for bronchodilator consumption (outcome 07), because of the various reporting of this variable as average percentage of days on which a participant took salbutamol up to week 26, number of doses of salbutamol per month after 16 weeks of treatment, and difference of the number of times bronchodilators were used at week four and 20. A tendency for a decreased consumption in the ketotifen group was suggested as all three trials point in this direction.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Efficacy evaluated by physician or parents/children</HEADING>
<P>The overall efficacy was evaluated by physicians in 10 trials with a total of 625 participants (outcome 08). In all but one trial, the estimated relative risk was less than one indicating a better perceived efficacy for ketotifen than placebo: the pooled relative risk for ineffectiveness is 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79). Some heterogeneity between trials was apparent (p = 0.021) which could not be explained by differences between age groups (outcome 9: p = 0.13) and appropriateness of blinding (outcome 10: p = 0.15). Furthermore, the funnel plot suggested bias (p = 0.068)</P>
<P>Overall efficacy assessed either by participants or parents was reported in seven trials with a total of 599 participants (outcome 11). The estimated relative risk of perceived effectiveness was in favour of the ketotifen group in five trials and in favour of the placebo group in only one trial. Overall, ketotifen shows a significantly favourable protection against perceived ineffectiveness (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). No indication for heterogeneity between trials (p = 0.088) or publication bias in meta-analysis (p = 0.28) is present.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Asthma symptoms/asthma exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Four trials with a total of 148 participants reported results on an asthma symptom score (outcome 14); all results were in favour of ketotifen. The pooled standardised mean difference shows a significant and beneficial effect of ketotifen (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.16). Neither between-trial heterogeneity (p = 0.61) nor publication bias was present (p = 0.62).</P>
<P>Participants with asthma exacerbations were reported in two trials (outcome 17). Both trials report very large and similar treatment effects. The overall relative risk is 0.31 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.59) indicating a highly significant beneficial effect of ketotifen in preventing exacerbations. However both trials included a high proportion of children with atopy (nasal symptoms in 70%; eczema in 31%; family history of asthma in 55%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Additional medication</HEADING>
<P>Four trials with a total of 306 participants evaluated the use of oral steroids (outcome 18); all results were in favour of ketotifen. The result indicates a significant protective effect of ketotifen against the use of rescue oral steroids (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58). Neither the test for heterogeneity (p = 0.16) nor the test for bias in meta-analysis (p = 0.89) is significant. Nevertheless, the treatment effect appeared weaker for trials with adequate blinding as compared to trials with unclear reporting of blinding methods (outcome 20).</P>
<P>Only two trials with 246 participants reported results on the use of theophylline (outcome 21). The overall relative risk is not significant 0.79 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.27).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Safety of ketotifen (analysis of side effects)</HEADING>
<P>Ketotifen increased the risk of sedation (seven trials; 439 participants; outcome 22; RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.59). No information was available on the time lag between onset of treatment with ketotifen and sedation to confirm resolution of sedation with use.</P>
<P>Weight gain was more common in the ketotifen group compared with placebo (five trials; 283 participants; outcome 25, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.99). The magnitude of weight gain could not be determined because of reporting issues. However, quantitative information on weight gain is available in three trials. <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1982</LINK> reported an average increase in weight of 2.1 kg for participants taking ketotifen and 1.6 kg for those treated with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (mean weight of all children: 35 kg). <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1993</LINK> reported an average increase in weight after 12 weeks of treatment in the ketotifen and control group of 1.11 kg and 0.67 kg, respectively (mean weight of all children: 10.5 kg). <LINK REF="STD-Canny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canny 1997</LINK> reported a difference in weight gain of 1 kg or 0.5 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> body mass for ketotifen compared to placebo after 32 weeks of treatment (mean age: 8.6 years). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Loftus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Loftus 1987</LINK> not included in this meta-analysis due to missing information reported an average weight gain of 1.56 kg with ketotifen versus 1.11 kg with placebo (mean age: 3.8 years). There is no indication of heterogeneity between trials or bias in meta-analysis for sedation and weight gain.</P>
<P>Only three trials with 238 participants reported the number of participants that withdrew due to side-effects. No evidence is available for an increased risk of withdrawal in the ketotifen group (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.92, <LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>) suggesting that side effects were considered minor.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-01 12:10:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Ketotifen (administered between 10 and 32 weeks at a daily dose of at least mg) used alone or in combination with other co-interventions (cromoglycate (DSCG), theophylline, inhaled and/or oral steroids) results in better control of asthma as attested by the clear decrease in bronchodilator use with no heterogeneity or suggestion of bias. This is supported by the number of patients remaining on bronchodilator at the end of treatment, physician and patient or parent preference as well as the relief of asthma symptoms and the decreased need of rescue oral steroids. The reported side effects (sedation, weight gain) are minor.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review are very heterogeneous on age, baseline asthma severity, type of asthma (atopic/non-atopic), use of ketotifen as single versus add-on agent. For most outcomes, subgroup and sensitivity analyses as well as tests of bias in meta-analysis had low power since only a limited number of trials could be combined in the analyses of this systematic review.</P>
<P>Age was not an important effect modifier for the main outcome. It appeared as an important co-variate, however, for the use of bronchodilators at the end of treatment (outcome 05). However, appropriateness of blinding is another possible explanation for heterogeneity between trials. With bias suggested by the funnel plot, it is questionable whether the effect of ketotifen is truly age-dependent.</P>
<P>As most of the trials were published before 1990, a definition of asthma according to current international guidelines was not provided. A retrospective classification is not possible due to lacking or inconsistent information. An attempt was made to sort the studies included in the primary outcome according to the baseline severity of the participants included. Severity was measured as three criteria: number of asthma attacks per month, additional medication allowed (especially oral steroids) and classification of asthma as "mild", "moderate" or "severe" provided by the authors of the studies. For the main outcome, patients reducing or discontinuing bronchodilator use, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Spicak-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spicak 1983</LINK> that included most severely affected patients as determined by the use of steroids and frequency of asthma attacks, showed the larger treatment effect of ketotifen. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution in this <I>post-hoc</I> analysis.</P>
<P>Overall, 46% of trials reported data on atopy/extrinsic asthma however with different levels of atopy. Most data are in respect to performed skin and IgE tests and/or a history of atopic symptoms (e.g. urticaria, allergic rhinitis, eczema). Some studies included a high proportion of children with atopy. Therefor the results of the review cannot necessarily be generalized to include all asthmatic children but may apply particularly to those who are atopic as well. As Ketotifen interferes with histamine receptors this is physiologically plausible even if it is a post-hoc finding and further research should be done.</P>
<P>Additional medication was definitely administered in two (theophylline, <LINK REF="STD-Myloma-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Myloma 1990</LINK>; theophylline and steroids, <LINK REF="STD-Spicak-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spicak 1983</LINK>) of the four trials contributing data to the main outcome: it remained unclear for the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chay 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Montoya-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Montoya 1988</LINK>). Therefore, no subgroup analysis comparing ketotifen as monotherapy versus add-on therapy could be performed. For the use of bronchodilators at the end of treatment (outcome 04), a <I>post-hoc</I> analysis failed to reveal difference in treatment effect associated with use of ketotifen as monotherapy versus add-on therapy. Imprecise reporting also prevented the documentation of any corticosteroid-sparing effect of ketotifen, when used as add-on to inhaled corticosteroids. As inhaled corticosteroids have proven to be effective and are the gold standard for therapy of children with moderate asthma today, this is one of the most important question that should be addressed in future studies.</P>
<P>We have assessed the risk of bias based on the degree to which the design of the study protects against bias. Our assessments were hampered due to poor reporting of study design in the publications (most trials were published long before the CONSORT statement, <LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>, which may lead to inadequate reporting of good methods rather than bad methods). Only eight trials have a Jadad score of 4 or 5 and the remaining trials have Jadad scores of 2 and 3 which is very low considering that randomisation and blinding were inclusion criteria for trials. Concealment of treatment allocation is adequate in a single trial and uncertain in the remaining trials. Similarly, the method of randomisation is well described and adequate in only one trial. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were only feasible for the method of double blinding which is well described and adequate in eight trials. This sensitivity analysis is identical to an analysis comparing high (Jadad score 4 or 5) and low (Jadad score 2 or 3) quality trials, since a significant proportion of the Jadad score is based on blinding (2 out of 5 points). Sensitivity analysis with respect to blinding/quality revealed no significant group difference for the main outcome, the magnitude of effect remained highly significant for trials with adequate blinding.</P>
<P>There was some indication that the treatment effect weakened or disappeared with adequate blinding for some but not all secondary outcomes. In fact, the effect of blinding was only apparent for use of bronchodilators at the end of treatment (outcome 06) and was suspected because of heterogeneity. For other outcomes with no apparent heterogeneity, treatment effect seemed to weaken with adequate reporting of blinding for evaluation of treatment efficacy by physicians (outcome 10) or patients/parents (outcome 13), and the use of oral steroids (outcome 20). In absence of heterogeneity, the interpretation of these findings is unclear.</P>
<P>Overall, results of this systematic review show a common pattern indicating clearly that ketotifen alone or in combination with other co-interventions results in a better control of asthma and/or wheezing in children than placebo. The validity of this conclusion is limited by the small number of participants for the assessed outcomes, the clinical heterogeneity and the low reported methodological quality of the included trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-01 12:10:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Ketotifen (at a dose not less than one mg daily for at least eight weeks) alone or in combination with other co-interventions results in better control of asthma and/or wheezing in children with a decrease in the consumption of bronchodilators, symptom score, number of exacerbations and the use of rescue oral steroids. This is further supported by a greater perception of the efficacy by physicians and parents/patients. Use of ketotifen appears safe being associated only with minor side effects (weight gain, transient sedation). Therefore, according to the existing evidence it seems reasonable to treat children with mild or moderate asthma with ketotifen especially if there is a history of atopy. No head-to head comparison of ketotifen with other commonly used medications in childhood asthma (e.g. inhaled steroids) is included in this review. Therefore, no recommendation on the indication of ketotifen in comparison to alternative medications in children with asthma and/or wheezing can be given. No evidence was found to answer the questions whether the effect of ketotifen is different when used as monotherapy versus add-on therapy and if the effect of ketotifen is depending on the severity level of asthma.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-01 12:10:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Based on the facts that the results of this systematic review indicate that ketotifen is more effective than placebo in all available outcomes and that placebo controlled trials in children with asthma are considered unethical in many countries, we recommend that future research should focus on comparisons of ketotifen to other drugs. Especially, the following investigations of ketotifen are important:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>as monotherapy versus low dose of inhaled steroids, leukotriene antagonists, or cromolyn;</LI>
<LI>as add-on therapy, to low dose of inhaled steroids with the recent recognition of the flat dose-response curve of inhaled steroids in mild and moderate asthma;</LI>
</OL>
<P>Further research should also concentrate on the subgroup of children (atopic versus non-atopic) that is most likely to benefit from Ketotifen.</P>
<P>A first step would be to address these topics in systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials should be performed if systematic reviews do not provide definite answers on the efficacy of ketotifen. The design of the trials should meet the following requirements:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>design: adequately concealed, randomised and double-blind;</LI>
<LI>intervention: ketotifen given at a daily dose not less than one mg for at least eight weeks;</LI>
<LI>co-interventions: rescue beta-2 agonists and systemic steroids;</LI>
<LI>inclusion criteria: children suffering from mild to moderate asthma defined according to established international guidelines;</LI>
<LI>primary outcome: change from baseline in the consumption of rescue medications;</LI>
<LI>reporting of trial results according to CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</LI>
